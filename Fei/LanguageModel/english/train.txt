KITZMILLER, et al., Plaintiffs vs. 
JONES, III Date : September 28, Place : Courtroom Number 2, 9th Floor Federal Building Walnut Street Harrisburg, Pennsylvania COUNSEL PRESENT: ERIC J. 
STEPHEN G. 
RICHARD B. 
RICHARD THOMPSON, ESQ. 
MUISE, EQ For Defendants Lori A. 
All right. 
That related specifically to -- filed by the reporters. 
Subsequently, the reporters were, if memory serves, approximately eight days ago, subpoenaed to testify by the plaintiffs in the case-in-chief. 
Now, have I mischaracterized anything from your standpoint? 
Now, the most salient question then is, with respect to the reporters' appearance today, is it your understanding that the reporters are intending to invoke the same privilege cited by them yesterday, if called, when called, to testify by the plaintiffs? 
All right. 
The floor is yours. 
And what I mean by that, with regard to all of you in this room is that we've got approximately 40 people from the media that are observing this trial in the courtroom, plus outside of the courtroom. 
I clearly will not get what I want, because at the end of the day, if I agree that my reporters are going to testify predicated upon something that I want to propose here, that's more than I would want, because I stand by the fact and they stand by the fact that there's a reporter's privilege here. 
And based upon that, they would then testify in court. 
One is that when we filed our motion to quash last week, quite honestly, we thought we did it in a timely fashion because we filed it only after we were served with the subpoena. 
They've got no protective order at all. 
Because the order I believe that you had previously entered related to the deposition and not related to their appearance in court. 
I interpret the order and the amended order to mean that Your Honor, in a sense, has addressed them as fact witnesses. 
And ironically -- in a sense, I have to commend both Mr. 
Bernard-Bubb because, again, they're paid per story. 
They might make $300, $400 a week if they write X number of stories, and that's it. 
She's a full-time mom. 
She has a seven-month old child, and so she works at night when her husband is at home. 
And he's been doing that for the last three years. 
But yet without a lot of education in terms of journalism, they believe that what they're standing for is the right thing. 
So having said that, their fear is that because of all those municipalities that they cover and the school districts that they cover, that at least in the Middle District Court, should a matter come up similar to this case, then they are exposed as a fact witness. 
Well, we provided an affidavit, and that affidavit indicated that we, if called upon to testify, would validate the authenticity of the articles that were written. 
Accepted by the plaintiffs, not accepted by the defendants. 
And at the time when you wrote the original order and you used the words "perceived, saw, and heard," we were concerned, as you well know, with the word "perceived" in terms as to what's the thought process. 
And, in fact, when you reviewed the notes of the reporters, you had also indicated that your review of Heidi Bubb's notes and the e-mails clearly evidence that there was no bias in the writings, those writings. 
And I wanted to let you go as far as you could, and I think I have to interject and I want to interject and I want to be clear, because I think it's important that I do that. 
It was an attempt to bring this to a head. 
It was not successful in solving the problem, but it was successful to bringing it to a head. 
With respect to the point that you made as it relates to their testimony at trial, that is a very valid point. 
So it would not revert back to an unprotected realm, if you will, at the time of trial. 
I understand your concern in that regard. 
The concern in this case, and it is a vital concern by all parties, is that we have, as you well know, to restate the obvious, we have newspaper articles within which there are quotes from individuals. 
The simple issue here, because it is the Court's understanding that these individuals have denied that they made these remarks, is from the plaintiffs' standpoint how can they get something that is, in my view, on the purpose test, which clearly goes to the truth of the matter asserted, how do they get these newspaper articles into evidence? 
The defendants might say that even with the reporters testifying, they can't get them in. 
But at the very least, in my view, and I think the plaintiffs might agree with this, the reporters would have to testify. 
I can't say that to the word, and that's why the opinions were crafted the way that they were. 
But I was as clear as I could possibly be that what is at issue here would be, for example, the particular events that the reporters wrote about and questions such as -- simple questions, did they attend the meeting, did they hear them say the comments, did they write the story immediately after, did they take notes at the time of the meeting. 
There I believe we would decidedly fly in the face of established case law. 
In this particular fact situation -- and I do think, I will say, on the issue of precedent, you can distinguish cases of -- and I'm not so sure I would be as fearful as some might be as to precedential value. 
We are in a very unique situation here, and that's what we have. 
I don't think it's necessary to do that. 
I will allow them to speak for themselves on that point, and then we'll decide what we're going to do at that point. 
Well, let me share with you why I have the issue that I have. 
I think we're beyond that. 
They indicated that they would not. 
So and So say something, why didn't they write that. 
But you weren't at the deposition, meaning you don't know that that question wouldn't be allowed and quite frankly yesterday you were in trial. 
And I know that you respect that. 
I do know from my private practice experience that I was extremely loathed to get a judge on the telephone in mid-deposition. 
You got it. 
What I invited by that opinion, though, was that I would be available -- and I believe in an issue that is as important to the reporters and to you, as their counsel, as this, it is appropriate for you to stop a deposition on a question like that, instruct your witness not to answer, and allow the Court to rule on it. 
That means everything that's set forth in that article. 
Then I think you should reschedule the depositions and try to do that. 
Because we don't have an order with respect to trial testimony -- and we don't, except for the fact that, again, they're naked. 
Well, let me share with you where I'm coming from, because I think what I've done here -- and obviously I can't do your job. 
Depending how long this trial goes, you might be my guest in terms of doing my job. 
And if I could just read this. 
Because I think it does exactly what you just said. 
By doing so, the reporters would be verbalizing the contents of said affidavit -- I think, actually, they were your words when we had the telephone conference -- by testifying as to what appears in the newspaper article or articles, unless such affidavit is otherwise accepted by all parties as validating and authenticating the contents of the newspaper article or articles in issue. 
However, no testimony shall relate to unpublished material or information or to the reporters' motivations, bias, mental impressions, or other information extrinsic to what the reporter saw and heard, and the reporter shall not be obligated to reveal any confidential sources. 
That's the clarity that I need. 
Buckingham or Mr. 
Meaning if you could adapt language similar to this for the trial testimony and I agree, I have no problem in them being at a deposition prior to trial with the same kind of language relative to that. 
Well, the problem Friday, I assume you fellows are getting out of here on Friday, but I'm not sure of that. 
I mean, whatever works. 
Do we need the whole team? 
Well, we'll do what we have to do. 
Go ahead. 
And this is why, in our opinion, Judge. 
Well, that's what I'm not going to get into. 
And what I don't want to do here is turn this into an oral argument on things that I've already decided. 
I think there is a privilege here, and I think the privilege sometimes gets drawn in what appears to be an ad hoc manner. 
To traipse into the area of why they selectively used a quote as opposed to not using other things that were said I think is to get on a very slippery slope. 
I am trying to narrowly draw this. 
And, as a matter of fact, I think if I did that and I ordered that and if -- I assume that the reporters would not testify and I would predict, if it went to the Third Circuit on that basis, I would be reversed. 
This looks artificial when you're dealing with a fact witness, but these are fact witnesses who are also reporters, and I am straining to try to find a fair way to do this. 
So I'm inclined to accept this language, you know, not word for word, only to the extent where it states, rather generically, "wherein an affidavit is provided," I would take that sentence and simply say that affidavits have been provided, rather than "wherein." It's somewhat artificial or a little strained as it relates to this case. 
And this gets into a semantical exercise to some degree but one that is important, I understand, to the reporters. 
And it will be abbreviated because of the time constraints on me, but we'll issue it forthwith, and it will indicate that you're going to -- they're going to sit for depositions under those circumstances. 
In what sense? 
"Reported" meaning in the books. 
I have no need. 
You have no idea. 
Your Honor, just in an effort to avoid needless procedure or inquiry, if I could just get a sense for what you have in mind and intend by the order. 
No, because -- and I know this is difficult, but it goes like this. 
We have articles. 
This is my understanding, either denied that they said what was reported in the articles or said that they were statements taken out of context. 
And that's one of the reasons that I'm line-drawing here. 
Did they hear the statement that is included in the article? 
How long after the meeting did they write their article, did they use the tape recorder, did they use notes as it related to that statement. 
To allay Mr. 
I sincerely believe that that gets into journalistic integrity, and that's problematic, and it's not my intent to allow that, nor would I allow any questioning on anything personal to the reporters. 
We are going to simply have them testify for the purpose of authenticating the contents of that article, nothing more, nothing less, because I really believe that to do more than that is to create, I think, a precedent which would have reporters called -- Mr. 
I don't share that fear. 
I strain mightily not to have to do that. 
Now, I don't know if that clarifies it. 
And I would ask this, with your leave, would it suffice to preserve my objection that I object here in chambers on the record? 
And I note that, and that's why I wanted to do this on the record. 
And to the extent that this really clarifies and reasserts what I have in my prior orders, I think you've preserved your position as it relates to that, and I understand that position. 
Anything from the plaintiffs? 
All right. 
I just wanted to make sure the word "affidavit" was in there. 
We will get a clarifying order out. 
What's your intention, what are your thoughts regarding how we should address this? 
I think you can assume, unless you doubt my word, I'm going to issue an order -- and I'm very serious -- I'm going to issue an order and that order will be forthwith. 
If I might be so bold, that we are satisfied with the resolution. 
We expect an order that is consistent with our understanding of an agreement that we reached -- I will let it to you to address that. 
We would just move on. 
I'm simply saying I don't want wiggle room that we're waiting to see, because I've had that experience now before. 
And you don't want to do it again, I know, I recognize. 
With regard to asking what they saw and heard with regard to all of the statements and the articles, I would assume that's statements made after the gavel banged and the meeting was over. 
Yes. 
THE COURT: Ask the question that you want to ask. 
No. 
The issue here, I'll restate, is the veracity of the articles themselves, did the reporter hear the statement as reported. 
The individual who believes -- who was quoted and believes the statement was taken out of context or flatly that he didn't or she didn't say it and it's inaccurate will have the opportunity to say that during the defendants case-in-chief or at any other time during the trial. 
Context is a dangerous thing as it relates to what we're doing here. 
That's of no moment. 
Now, I can't be any clearer than that. 
Your Honor, one thing I might ask, since it is perhaps likely that issues are going to arise during the deposition, I'm wondering if we could now attempt to schedule the deposition at a time when everybody, including Your Honor, might be available to intercede. 
Monday. 
I cannot do it Monday because I couldn't get here on Sunday. 
I could do it Tuesday, I could do it Wednesday. 
I can't do it. 
I'm leaving tomorrow. 
And, you know, we'll work through that issue. 
I understand those things could come up in the course of the deposition, and I'll rule on those as I can if I'm not instantly available. 
How about later today? 
Let's get back on the record here, because we've got people waiting and I want to get going. 
But I will tell you in concluding that if it is at night, if you do it at night, I will give you my home number, and you can contact me so we get this finished. 
I will not attend the deposition, though. 
Anything else? 
Thank you, Your Honor. 
(The discussion in chambers was concluded.) We return in session, and I want to apologize to the assembled spectators and, of course, to the media. 
These things arise during trials from time to time. 
And we try to keep them at a minimum and we will keep them at a minimum during the trial. 
You may call your next witness. 
JULIE SMITH, called as a witness, having been duly sworn or affirmed, testified as follows: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. 
Julie Ann Smith. 
And is that within the area covered by the Dover Area School District? 
And how long have you lived there? 
How old are they? 
Your daughter Katherine, what school does she attend? 
What grade is she in? 
Please tell us what you do for a living. 
Now, did there come a time when you learned that the Dover Area School District Board of Directors was considering approval of a biology textbook? 
And tell us, when did you learn that? 
And what was the basis for your knowledge? 
Do you remember what you read? 
Please tell us what you remember learning at that time. 
And do you remember anything else that you learned at that time? 
Okay. 
Yes, they did in August. 
Yes. 
I learned that from the paper, also. 
That they were going to have Of Pandas and People in the classroom as a supplemental text to the biology book. 
It was donated. 
Yes. 
In October, I believe it was, in '04. 
And did you attend that board meeting? 
And did you learn anything else from reading the newspapers at that time? 
Okay. 
Yes. 
It's the newsletter that came to the house in the mail that told -- that had the statement included that they were going to be teaching in the biology class. 
Well, it says it was February, so I'm assuming it was February. 
Do you believe that the board's actions in this case, the change to the biology curriculum and its other actions, have caused you harm? 
And can you tell us what harm you believe that it has caused you? 
And she looked at me and she said, Well, Mom, evolution is a lie, what kind of Christian are you, anyway, which I found to be very upsetting. 
Yeah, I asked her why she said that, and she said in school what they had been talking about or amongst her friends and what's going on. 
And how did that harm you? 
I have no problems with my faith and evolution. 
No further questions of this witness. 
Thank you, Your Honor. 
THOMPSON: Mrs. 
I represent the defendants in this case. 
Do you remember being involved in that deposition? 
Were you present in court for all the testimony that has been given in this trial? 
Now, whose testimony have you heard so far? 
I heard Barrie Callahan, Bryan Rehm. 
Okay. 
No. 
Yes, they called me. 
And so the ACLU contacted you, and you agreed to become a plaintiff in this case? 
Now, will you agree with me that the policy which is the subject matter of this lawsuit, the curriculum change in the biology for ninth grade, took place on October 18th, 2004? 
And that policy was implemented for the first time in January of 2005. 
That's correct. 
My son was in college. 
Yes, that's correct. 
She was in school. 
She was in grade ten. 
No, that's not true. 
No, but it would affect all the students at the school. 
This policy provided that the statement was read to ninth-grade biology students. 
I agree it was read to ninth-grade biology students. 
And your daughter had already graduated from the ninth grade? 
So at the time that this policy was implemented, both of your children were out of the ninth grade? 
Now, you indicated to your lawyer that you got involved because of newspaper articles that you read? 
Okay. 
Okay. 
So in 2004, prior to this -- prior to you becoming a plaintiff, you never attended a board meeting in that year? 
Okay. 
In 2003, you never attended a board meeting. 
No, I had attended board meetings previously. 
I asked you, in 2003, did you attend a board meeting? 
In -- Objection. 
One at a time. 
Thompson. 
Objection, arguing with the witness and beyond the scope of direct. 
It's appropriate cross-examination. 
I apologize, Your Honor. 
That happens. 
Why don't you restate your question, Mr. 
Okay. 
THOMPSON Is it true that you did not attend a board meeting in the year 2003? 
Is it true that you didn't attend a board meeting in 2002? 
And that was the year 2000, was it not? 
Mrs. 
You may. 
I would like you to direct your attention to Page 13, and I would like you to read out loud the question that you are asked starting with Line 18 and all the way down through that page and then going on to the next page, Page 14, and reading from Line 1 through Line 4. 
You want me to read out loud starting on 18? 
Gillen, and A represents your answer. 
"Let me just make sure I get you there and go on. 
So that the record will reflect, that was the question and now your answer, starting with Line 21. 
Yes. 
When I went to some board meetings, it was several years ago. 
Gillen asked you starting on Line 1? 
I am not familiar with the dates for the building project. 
That's correct. 
Yes. 
Does that seem right that the board meetings that you attended prior to being a plaintiff in a lawsuit was in the year 2000? 
So based upon the response that you gave to your attorney, is it a fair statement that you began as a plaintiff in this case in December, 2004, without ever having personally witnessed the actions of the Dover School Board as they debated and enacted the policy on which this lawsuit is based? 
HARVEY: Objection. 
BY MR. 
Now, wait. 
He asked whether you were present at any of the board meetings while they debated and then enacted this resolution, and I'm not aware of any testimony that they debated the resolution. 
I'll overrule the objection. 
Do you recall the question? 
Let's have the question read back, please. 
BY MR. 
In fact, the information that you were getting about what the school board was doing in 2004 came from newspapers. 
That's correct. 
That's correct. 
Is that correct? 
What were the two -- what were the newspapers that you were looking at during this time? 
Okay. 
That's correct. 
And it is true that you never spoke to any of the members of the Dover School Board about the issues that concerned you. 
That's correct. 
Is that correct? 
You never e-mailed them. 
That's correct. 
No. 
Is that correct? 
Okay. 
No. 
No. 
In fact, one of the issues in this case is this book Of Pandas and People. 
That's correct. 
I didn't feel that I could look at it. 
Well, did you make any effort to go and look at it? 
Now, your attorney referred to a newsletter that you received in February. 
Yes. 
Excuse me. 
Okay. 
I would like you to read from that newsletter on the top left-hand side in that box. 
We hope this publication will help those interested better understand the substance of the policy while eliminating any misconceptions some may have about the curriculum change. 
It was through this policy that you first learned about the statement that was going to be read. 
Okay. 
And so this newsletter was actually providing information to the residents of Dover as to what the actual newsletter was -- excuse me, what the actual statement was going to say. 
Yes. 
So you had no problem with the fact that the newsletter was being produced, even though you had a problem with the policy. 
No. 
Have you ever heard that? 
Okay. 
People that I work with, other people in the district. 
Is that correct? 
And the newspaper. 
Have you been interviewed? 
No. 
Objection. 
Do you want to respond to that Mr. 
Well, I think it's common experience and it's knowledge, it's common sense. 
I'll sustain the objection. 
BY MR. 
I said I was upset about it because I didn't find a problem with it with my religion. 
I have a problem with it because my daughter came home from school and she says to me, What kind of Christian are you, anyway? 
If you recall your deposition -- and I certainly will give you an opportunity to look at it if you don't recall it -- the incident that you're referring to, also you received information that your daughter was a member of a Bible club. 
Yes. 
Isn't that correct? 
And that it was -- she had a lot of friends who went to Protestant fundamental churches. 
Yes, she does. 
Isn't that correct? 
Plus they talked about it. 
I spoke to my deacon about this situation, and all I know is what he told me. 
He's a deacon at St. 
This is testimony in the case-in-chief, and we're afield. 
THOMPSON Now, the book Of Pandas and People, you don't mind that book being in the library, do you? 
You heard yesterday, if you attended the deposition of -- excuse me, the testimony of Mr. 
Did you hear that? 
Let Mr. 
Rehm testified that they had reached a compromise with some of the board members that they were going to allow the book Of Pandas and People in the science classroom. 
I'll overrule the objection. 
Rehm's testimony yesterday? 
Well, then go ahead. 
No further questions, Your Honor. 
Thank you, Mr. 
Then, ma'am, you may step down. 
And I don't think we have any exhibits to enter, do we? 
P127 is already in evidence. 
Your Honor, the plaintiffs call to the stand Plaintiff Christy Rehm. 
You certainly may. 
HARVEY Please tell us your name. 
Are you married, Mrs. 
Yes. 
Bryan Rehm. 
My children? 
I have a 14-year-old daughter, Alix, an eight-year-old daughter Paige, a seven-year-old son Ian, and a 15-month-old son Lucas. 
I mean your immediate family, you and your husband and your children. 
And how long have you lived there? 
And had you lived in Dover previously to that in your life? 
I grew up in Dover, I attended Dover High School, graduated from Dover High School. 
Grade level, okay, yes. 
I have a first-grader, and then obviously the baby is not in school yet. 
Yes. 
And my son is hearing-impaired, so he is charged with the education of Dover School District, meaning that they have to provide his education, but he actually attends classes at a hearing-impaired classroom. 
Yes. 
Yes, she is. 
As I said, I graduated from Dover High School. 
I received a BA from Millersville University in English, and I also have a degree in journalism, as well. 
Do you work outside the home? 
Where do you teach? 
And what grade do you teach? 
Did there come a time when you learned that the Dover Area School District Board of Directors was considering a change to -- was considering approval of a biology textbook? 
Do you remember when that was? 
I can't tell you exactly when. 
Well, because, like I said, my husband had been a teacher at the school, and he had sort of been directed by the high school principal to attend the meeting in support of the different things that were happening. 
And can you recall anything that happened at that meeting on June the 7th? 
But I recall Barrie Callahan speaking about the textbook. 
And she was speaking about the textbook, just questioning them. 
But I do know that she was upset with them about this textbook, the textbook process, the students not having a textbook. 
Do you remember if any board member spoke back to her in response to her questions? 
Bill Buckingham said to her -- and I know Bill Buckingham because at the time he lived down the street from my grandparents and for many years lived there. 
Unfortunately I was in the restroom at the time that Max Pell was speaking because -- my husband told you I was eight months pregnant. 
And so at the time when Max was speaking -- I believe that there were people who spoke in between she and Max Pell. 
I know him because he was my husband's student, though. 
Well, like I said, I was reentering the room from the bathroom, so I was sort of in the doorway. 
So the comments that were coming back were, I assume, directed at him. 
And I was very upset by that because I attended college and I don't feel as if I were brainwashed. 
At this time, no. 
I'd like you to take a look at what's been marked as Exhibit P46. 
Just take a moment to look at it. 
Do you have that in front of you? 
Have you ever seen it before? 
Did you see it at or around the date that it was published? 
What's the date on it? 
Who is the author? 
And can you tell us what publication its from? 
Just now I skimmed it, yes. 
Yes. 
Mr. 
It's important that having refreshed your recollection, if it jogs something or re-creates a memory, that you testify in answer to Mr. 
Do not look back and read from the article as you're testifying, please. 
Yes. 
BY MR. 
Now, do you remember if you attended another meeting of the Dover Area School District Board of Directors approximately a week later on June the 14th? 
And why did you attend that meeting? 
In addition, I was very angry when I left the June 7th meeting just because of the demeanor of the school board and the things that were being said. 
And so I pretty well made sure, at the beginning of that meeting, which went on for quite a long time, that I wouldn't miss anything, so I took care of my bathroom needs beforehand. 
My sister had graduated that year, and I attended the commencement ceremony. 
And essentially she was speaking up for the teachers and the biology textbook. 
She's the department chairperson, and, actually, I had her as a science teacher. 
After she spoke, Bill Buckingham had made a comment to her about her -- where did she get her law degree from. 
Do you want to put a question on the floor? 
BY MR. 
I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't getting my meetings mixed up. 
I'm sorry, I recall something else, as well. 
And Charlotte Buckingham I recall really being the only person who got up to stand in defense of the school board, and she was Mr. 
Buckingham's wife. 
And she also talked about school prayer and the need for school prayer in that speech that she had prepared. 
And many other members of the community spoke, as well. 
HARVEY Did your husband speak? 
In fact, he hadn't prepared to speak, but he was very upset, as many people in the audience were, and he stood up to speak. 
Objection, Your Honor. 
The question was, did your husband speak. 
My next question was going to be simply if you could tell us what -- but I think she's already told us what she can recall her husband said. 
That moots the objection, and you can move to the next question. 
HARVEY Do you remember Bill Buckingham speaking at this meeting? 
There were not many meetings where Bill Buckingham did not speak. 
And it seemed to me sort of an inappropriate apology because -- or maybe "inappropriate" is not the correct word, but not a sincere apology because almost immediately after he had given his apology, he started doing the same things that he had always done, which was to demean the public, to say negative comments. 
Yes. 
He made comments about the liberals in black robes coming and taking away our freedoms in the school. 
Now, did you attend any other meetings of the Dover Area School District Board of Directors that summer? 
And did you attend any meetings that fall? 
And can you just tell us briefly what you can recall about that meeting? 
Jen Miller spoke, although I didn't really know who she was at the time. 
I recall Bertha Spahr again speaking. 
And, again, other members of the community spoke at that meeting. 
No, we didn't. 
During the board meeting? 
No. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Do you remember anyone requesting access to -- Oh, yes. 
Yes. 
And we wanted to hear that for ourselves, so my husband had previously requested the tapes and then at that meeting he stood again to request the tapes. 
And do you remember if any members of the school board spoke in response to either your husband or Barrie Callahan with respect to the subject of the tapes? 
Barrie -- I'm sorry, Alan Bonsell said very clearly that -- Dr. 
And additionally, Alan Bonsell made the comment that they couldn't release the tapes because after speaking with their solicitor, there would possibly be legal issues, ramifications if they released the tapes. 
Mrs. 
Yes, absolutely. 
Well, in numerous ways. 
On the other hand, they've said that it enhances state standards and critical thinking. 
And I don't necessarily think that's just in my mind. 
The way I dress when I go to work tells my students something. 
So I think we're charged with, you know, having an ethical decision to make when we walk into the classroom, the things that we say and the things that we do, and so I think that's very important. 
And if that's what's happening in the Dover school system and my children are in that school system, that they're routinely establishing practices that is not teaching in the classroom, then that's shameful. 
It's not just the biology class that has been affected by this. 
It used to be a weekly occurrence. 
Also, intelligent design is not a scientific concept. 
And because I don't subscribe to that particular brand of religion, I feel that I and my daughter, my family, are being ridiculed, and my daughter feels the pressure. 
And I have faith in myself and in my husband and in my pastor to do that, not the school system. 
Muise's cross-examination of the witness. 
(Recess taken.) Mr. 
Thank you, Your Honor. 
MUISE Good afternoon, Ms. 
Your oldest child is 14 years old. 
Yes. 
Yes, she is. 
Is that correct? 
After looking at her syllabus, it appears that evolution comes later in the course. 
Now, you testified about two -- or several meetings, but two meetings in particular I want to ask you some questions about. 
Yes. 
Buckingham? 
There were statements made by many of the school board members that I found objectionable. 
Buckingham always seemed to say very inappropriate things. 
It's just that I didn't give much credit to Noel Weinrich's comments because he would say things like, Darwin's at least what, 60 years old, a theory becomes a theory if you say it over and over again. 
But they were all very outspoken. 
Yes. 
It very well could be. 
But the statements that you testified to and the controversy that you were describing was surrounding the purchase or selection of that particular biology book for the school district. 
Yes, it was definitely the Miller-Levine textbook. 
And, in fact, the school district purchased the Miller-Levine biology book to be used as the primary text for the ninth-grade biology class. 
Yes. 
Yes, with the dragonfly on it. 
She has the book, yes. 
Have I looked through the book? 
She wasn't given a copy of Pandas and People, was she? 
don't agree with the age of, you know, the earth and their opinion. 
And I do not believe the same things as the board members who adopted that statement. 
But I do know that, in its original context, it was creationism that was being used. 
And so, again, you're associating Young Earth creationism with intelligent design? 
If you could be shown that intelligent design does not require the action of a supernatural creator and, in fact, is based on observable and empirical facts, would you change your opinion? 
Would I believe it? 
But I suppose that if intelligent design could follow scientific methods, then -- and it were proven to be scientific by scientists, it was accepted by scientific communities, then I would have no reason not to accept that. 
Is it your understanding that Darwin's theory of evolution will be taught in this class pursuant to the Pennsylvania academic standards? 
And as far as I know, that is the case, because Dover says that it is a standards-based school, and so I assume that when they say that and they say that students have to pass certain material before they can be advanced into new material, that they would have to be abiding by the state standards. 
To following state standards, no, I have no objection. 
Yes, the PSSA test, yes. 
To my students taking a PSSA test, well, you know, I -- being an educator, I'm not in love with PSSA tests or standardized tests. 
I would hope that they would provide lots of academic information on those tests. 
I'm sorry, can you repeat that? 
Is it your understanding that because Dover is a standard-based district, the class instruction is going to focus on preparing students to achieve proficiency on those standard-based tests that we were just describing? 
Is it your understanding that because Dover is a standards-driven district, that students will not be tested on the intelligent design theory? 
And from your previous answer, I believe you do understand that the Dover School District purchased, for its ninth-grade biology class, the edition of the Miller and Levine biology book. 
Yes. 
No, I do not. 
Actually, did you ask me if it's my understanding or if -- If it's your understanding. 
It follows state standards, of course. 
And I did look at that section, and I looked basically through the book. 
Has Dr. 
Maybe we should ask. 
I feel, actually, that there are topics that probably could be explored in more detail, but I understand that there are limitations within any textbook that you have to hit on core concepts. 
Is it your understanding that it presents Darwin's theory of evolution in a manner that is consistent with its standing in the scientific community? 
But as much as I know about what the high school science standards say, it would be in standing with that. 
I mean, I can absolutely say that without knowing everything about Darwin or knowing everything about science. 
No, I would have no reason to believe that. 
Yes. 
Right, just as no student is required to read anything that's in the library unless they choose to. 
No, absolutely not. 
Are you aware of that? 
In fact, there were different drafts of that statement that I had seen. 
Because it was again read in, I believe, like May, and there was a change from that point in time, unless I'm incorrect and that is the change that I'm thinking of. 
Yes, I am aware that there was a change. 
Yes. 
Actually, I am, because I recall them -- an organization actually sending the library those books, because there was controversy in those books being put in there, too. 
They're in the library? 
I'm assuming that they had gotten there. 
No, I do not. 
Ma'am, you may step down. 
Your Honor, plaintiffs call to the stand Plaintiff Beth Eveland. 
Sure. 
DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. 
-- is it Ms. 
Mrs. 
Eveland. 
And how long have you lived there? 
Are you married? 
Do you have children? 
How many children do you have? 
And how old are they? 
And what schools do they attend? 
And do you have plans for your children to continue to attend public schools in Dover? 
And do you work outside the home? 
And when was that? 
Now, I'd like you to look at what's been marked and is in the notebook before you as P46. 
Well, what is 46? 
Well, I don't know what the question is. 
We'll hold that thought, and you can proceed with the question, because all we have is the exhibit that is a newspaper article. 
Yes, I did. 
Yes, I did. 
It would have been approximately June 15th, June 16th. 
When I remember that I attended this board meeting? 
In preparation for trial, looking back through my deposition testimony and thinking about things that had happened, it occurred to me that, you know, I was there at that June meeting. 
I remember Casey Brown, one of the board members at the time, discussing, during the board meeting with the board, that she felt they were, I'm paraphrasing, treading, you know, on -- they were treading closely to violating the Pennsylvania State Board of Education regulations on religion in the classroom. 
Yes, I do. 
I remember Bill Buckingham making the statement, years ago somebody died on the Cross, can't someone take a stand for Him. 
I was shocked. 
And did you do anything in response to that? 
I had wrote a letter to the editor. 
I submitted it to the three local newspapers, York Daily Record, York Sunday News, and York Dispatch. 
Yes, I did. 
Now, please turn to what's been marked and is in the notebook before you as P56. 
Do you have it in front of you? 
And can you tell us what it is? 
And I'm going to ask you to read this letter into the record. 
Objection, Your Honor. 
Say it again. 
Objection, hearsay. 
She's going to be reading in the letter, the contents of the statement. 
They're obviously offering it for the truth of the matter. 
She wrote the letter. 
BY MR. 
"As a parent in the Dover Area School District, I must convey my shock and utter dismay at William Buckingham's comments regarding the search for new biology texts for the high school. 
Buckingham's comments as quoted in Wednesday's York Daily Record: 'This country wasn't founded on Muslim beliefs or evolution. 
"In partnership with family and community to educate students, we emphasize sound, basic skills and nurture the diverse needs of our students as they strive to become lifelong learners and contributing members of our global society. 
How sad that a member of our own school board would be so closed-minded and not want to carry on the mission of Dover schools. 
If it was simply a matter of selecting a text that gives two contradicting scientific theories equal time, that would be an entirely different matter, but it's not. 
"Mr. 
Yes, it was. 
Yes, I did. 
It was a published response noting Heather Geesey as the author. 
I believe it was either the York Dispatch or the York Daily Record. 
It was published in the York Daily Record. 
Yes, I did. 
Objection, Your Honor. 
She has no personal knowledge. 
Do you want to respond to the objection? 
We submitted an exhibit list to the other side, and we were told there were no authentication issues with respect to any of this, so there's no question about the authenticity of this, nor do I understand -- and further, it's not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, so there's no hearsay objection. 
My understanding was that there was not an authentication issue. 
I did agree with Steve that we -he has an affidavit from someone who has indicated they have collected newspaper articles. 
Very well. 
Geesey to the York Daily Record. 
That is correct, Your Honor. 
Now, counsel for the plaintiff is indicating the letter as being produced on the issue of -- or to show notice, obviously, on the effect prong. 
But the purpose of the letter is under the second prong. 
That's one of the issues in the case. 
All right. 
Our position on that we've articulated. 
Well, I think that you reserved that argument. 
I'm inclined -- because it's a bench trial, I'll admit it conditionally. 
BY MR. 
"This letter is in regard to the comments made by Beth Eveland from York Township in the June York Sunday News. 
In fact, if you read the statement, it says to educate our students so that they can be contributing members of society. 
It is just a fact. 
"The definition of 'theory' is merely a speculative or an ideal circumstance. 
You can teach creationism without it being Christianity. 
That made me question, first of all, was she writing on behalf of just herself or on behalf of the whole school board since it was signed Dover Area School Board Director, and I sensed a religious intonation. 
All of them. 
Yes, I was. 
No, I didn't. 
Yes, I do. 
I feel it's my duty, as a parent, to introduce any kind of faith-based concept to my children, not the Dover Area School District. 
It's just something that I feel strongly that my husband and I, that's our task to bring faith to our children. 
No further questions. 
Cross-examine, Mr. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. 
Yes, she is. 
That's correct. 
Is that correct? 
I believe in your deposition you indicated in your day-to-day events you try to spark your children's interest in science? 
And you believe it's important to make science interesting for your children? 
You don't have any specific training in evolutionary theory. 
No, I don't. 
Is it your understanding that Darwin's theory of evolution is going to be taught pursuant to the state academic standards? 
And that students will be tested on subjects that are based on those standards, including the theory of evolution? 
Is it also your understanding that it is a standards-based district, so classroom instruction will focus on achieving those standard-based assessments in which they will eventually be tested on? 
And intelligent design is not part of those standard-based assessments? 
And these board meetings that you attended in June, the controversy was surrounding the purchase of a biology text for the class. 
Yes. 
I believe at the time it was the Miller and Levine biology text. 
Buckingham's objections to that biology text which precipitated some of these statements that you were referring to in your direct testimony? 
And what action did the board actually take with regard to the biology book? 
With regard to the biology book for the ninth-grade class. 
Have you seen that book? 
Now, my understanding is you went to these board meetings in June because of the controversy over the biology book? 
You said you just skimmed this biology book that was at the center of the controversy? 
In those two minutes that you spent actually looking at the book that was the center of this controversy, was there anything in that two-minute review that you saw that you objected to? 
I just basically looked through the table of contents quickly. 
That's my understanding, yes. 
Fairly contentious, yes. 
Now, is it your recollection that the first time the Pandas book was mentioned was during the July meeting that you attended? 
I cannot give you a specific date. 
How about mentioning the theory of intelligent design, do you recall when you may have heard that theory first mentioned? 
Buckingham and Mr. 
Yeah. 
And I believe the first -- as I testified earlier, the first meeting I actually had attended was the second meeting in June. 
And during this conversation, he approached you and asked if you had read or were familiar with some comments that he had quoted in the paper, and those were Mr. 
Correct? 
And he asked you what your thoughts were about those comments? 
And he also asked you if you would ask for Mr. 
Correct? 
And you told him that you didn't think that was going to happen? 
And your sense for why he asked you this was that you thought he was trying to elicit something sensational for his paper? 
BY MR. 
And I'd like you to read, if you look on Page 64, read from Line 18 through 25, and then we'll continue on the next page once you finish that. 
I told him just simply what I had read. 
"Yeah. 
It was my first board meeting. 
Maldonado about the happenings with the board. 
For which paper? 
I said earlier Mr. 
I believe he is actually a reporter for the Daily Record. 
Heidi Bubb quite a bit? 
Well, I don't recall whether or not I did say after suit was filed, but I'll take your word for it if it's in my deposition testimony. 
I mean, if that's what it says in my deposition testimony, that's what I testified to at the time. 
Okay. 
Heidi Bubb. 
"She would generally approach me after the meetings. 
She would ask me occasionally my thoughts, public comment, what I thought -- why I thought the board was doing what they were doing, those such things." Now, back in July or August, 2004, you had communications with the National Center for Science Education? 
I believe you joined the Listserv? 
And you also had a discussion with them regarding an interview with the AP? 
Did you do that interview? 
Ma'am, do you understand that the statement that's going to be read to the students in the ninth-grade biology class was modified in June of 2005? 
And do you understand that that modification indicated that the book Of Pandas and People would be in the library along with other resources regarding intelligent design? 
Do you have any objection to that? 
Now, you testified about the harm that you've received based on these statements and the comments and the actions of the board. 
Okay. 
"Question: Is there anything else that the board has done here in connection with the curriculum change that provides a basis for your complaint? 
It may just be a big misunderstanding." Were you testifying truthfully when you answered that question? 
No further questions, Your Honor. 
No, Your Honor. 
Then, ma'am, we thank you. 
This is probably an appropriate time for us to end today. 
P46 is the York Daily Record article. 
Is that right, Mr. 
Yes. 
Yes, Your Honor. 
The objection is noted. 
And I will note the objection. 
All right. 
P60 is the letter from School Board Member Geesey to the editor again. 
Over the objection already of the defendants, we'll reaffirm that, but you can make any other objections you want to on the record, but I think that was thoroughly argued at that time. 
All right. 
With everybody's indulgence, I would expect to go to approximately 5 o'clock, no later than 5 o'clock tomorrow to make up for the time that we lose during the morning session. 
on Thursday. 
(Whereupon, the proceedings were adjourned at 4:20 p.m.) CERTIFICATION I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me on the within proceedings and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same. 
Lori A. 
APPEARANCES: LAWRENCE LESSIG, ESQ., Stanford, California; on behalf of the Petitioners. 
OLSON, ESQ., Solicitor General, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.; on behalf of the Respondent. 
John D. 
Mr. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS Mr. 
Petitioners submit such a blanket extension of existing terms exceeds Congress's power under the Copyright Clause and it violates the First Amendment. 
The Government has argued as if petitioners had advanced a general theory of the Copyright Clause, or a general constraint under which Congress must operate. 
Lessig, I'll tell you what bothers me about your position, and that is that Congress has extended the term so often through the years, and if you are right, don't we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions of time? 
Justice, we do not believe that the very first act extended terms at all. 
The 1790 act granted a term for works that already existed in precisely the pattern that the English parliament had done in the Statute of Anne in 1710, and that the English parliament did with monopolies, general monopolies in the statute. 
That's right. 
Those extensions, however, were never challenged in any court and certainly not considered by this Court. 
This is the first time I can remember where this Court has been pointed to changed circumstances as a reason to reaffirm the Framers' values, because for most of this period, Mr. 
Now, it's not the case that the earlier extensions were not questioned on constitutional grounds. 
That's right, there is no court challenge. 
Lessig, your theory, as I understand it, regardless of changed circumstances or not, your basic theory, which on your argument would have been appropriate at any time historically, is that there has at least got to be the possibility of a kind of a causal connection between the extension and the promotion or inducement for the creation of some subsequent work, but why is that any more plausible a reading of the Promotion Clause than simply a reading that says the Promotion Clause requires that there be a general scheme in place, which overall tends to promote or induce, and part of one aspect of that scheme can be that the -- that at the discretion of Congress the period of protection is extended from time to time? 
Justice Souter, the reason is exactly related to the point I began with, that this is a case about limits and not about discretion. 
That's right. 
-- of clause? 
Do you say the same thing for scope? 
-- the expanded applications of copyright, and Congress itself extends the scope from time to time. 
I -- Why -- or -- and if you wouldn't, why not? 
To make that very specific, if we agree with you, does that mean that we would, in principle, have to hold the 1976 extension unconstitutional? 
Now they're extending it life of the author plus 70. 
And if the former is, the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous. 
Whether this Court would apply such a holding in this case to that act is a question that would have to be resolved under the retrospective -- Maybe we ought to find another theory, then. 
It's been grounded in their claim that the treaty power creates some special power. 
That's certainly true, and we also believe that, for the reasons averted to by amicus AOL in this case and the reasons you've just suggested, the disruption in that context under the retrospectivity cases Ryder and Reynoldsville Casket Company would be sufficient to fit it within the, quote, "severe disruption exception" to the retrospectivity. 
I just don't see any empirical evidence for that. 
Nothing in our Copyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding progress. 
Well, perhaps I misunderstood. 
Well, the thrust certainly -- I thought that's the whole underpinning of your case. 
Well, but you want more than that. 
We want the right to copy verbatim works that should be in the public domain and would be in the public domain but for a statute that cannot be justified under ordinary First Amendment analysis or under a proper reading of the limits built into the Copyright 16 Clause. 
Lessig, on your First Amendment argument I don't see where the retroactivity-prospectivity comes in, because -- I follow your argument under the Copyright Clause, but if you're saying that the time is too long, the public domain should get this stuff sooner rather than later, would you explain to me how your prospectivity-retrospective line fits into your First Amendment claim? 
LESSIG: Justice, we've argued that it would be inappropriate in this case for the Court to consider the prospective line until they decide whether the case, whether the prospective and retrospective is severable, and we submit it's an easy case to show that it's not. 
-- argument you're making that as, I take it, an argument independent of, it doesn't hang on your Copyright Clause argument. 
I -- That's right. 
When Congress legislates prospectively, it has no way to know who's going to benefit from its extension. 
Your First Amendment test is a stringent one. 
If you take that position, I don't see how you make the retroactive-prospective line work. 
Well, Justice, that certainly is the reason the Government offers for this pattern. 
So that line is already drawn in the practice that Congress has adopted, but our point is, the only way to assure -- But Congress has -- or, you're not disputing that Congress has always made these extensions, both retroactive and prospective? 
In 1976 -- Because that was what you said -- that's -- the pattern under the CTEA is identical to the one in the '76 act. 
So they have extended it to both. 
And so I'm asking you -- perhaps I'm missing it. 
It seems that you're just saying there that 70 years is an unreasonable -- is not necessary. 
And it doesn't serve an important purpose. 
Whereas if you don't accept the Copyright Clause claim, then, in order to make the First Amendment analysis we've simply got to say, well, gee, is the promotion of useful art and so on more important than the public domain, and can we say that that allows a distinction between 50 years and 70 years? 
Our Copyright Clause argument is certainly a way of framing why extensions of subsisting terms cannot be seen to promote the First Amendment interest of speech at all. 
Let's assume we don't -- for the sake of argument here, let's assume we don't accept the Copyright Clause argument. 
Yes, of course we do. 
I mean, at that point I'm where Justice Ginsburg is. 
The First Amendment argument we've argued in our brief is with respect to the retrospective extension, and the First Amendment argument is, that needs to -- No, but that's the Copyright Clause argument, and it seems to me you're saying, okay, we then apply that in First Amendment analysis, which allows us to make a coherent intermediate scrutiny argument. 
What I'm saying is not that it's the retrospectivity that makes the First Amendment argument troubling -- I mean, that drives our First Amendment argument. 
Well -- I mean, this would be quite a new proposition. 
-- in effect. 
Justice, that's right. 
It didn't include the derivative rights, it didn't include the display rights, and it certainly -- Right. 
-- because it does take a lot of things out of the public domain that one would think that someone in Congress would want to think hard about. 
But having done that, it's very difficult to find the basis in the Constitution for saying it isn't a limited term. 
-- but is it not limited? 
Right, and we submit the Framers had something very different in mind than the rule against perpetuities. 
What was the problem they were solving? 
But does it violate the Constitution? 
Well, you know, certainly what is happening in the country today in the way of congressional -- under the Commerce Clause is totally different than what the Framers had in mind, but we've never felt that that was the criterion. 
That's right. 
In many respects, Mr. 
But isn't -- Can I ask you about one of the limits, just focusing on the Copyright Clause and the progress of science and useful arts? 
We're happy to adopt a broader interpretation of what promote the progress is about, within the general framework that the Framers established in light of the English practice, which was a quid pro quo. 
In your view, that's perfectly constitutional? 
My view is -- Well, I thought that was the question you were getting, and I thought you were saying -- I must have misunderstood. 
No. 
But this Court's opinion in Graham and in Feist made clear that it could not extend copyrights to works in the public domain. 
No. 
Justice Ginsburg, we have no quarrel with the objective of harmonization fitting within the "promote the progress of science" understanding subject to constitutional limitations. 
The analogy doesn't seem to work. 
All that I'm suggesting is, here is a plain meaning of the term that gives effect to the constitutional limit in a way that assures that, in fact, the limit is respected, contrary to the Government's argument, which, in effect, permits Congress the power perpetually to extend terms. 
Very well, Mr. 
OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT Mr. 
That is that the first Congress explicitly gave copyright protection to the authors of any books already printed as well as explicitly the owners of existing copyrights. 
As this Court explained 100 and some years ago in its Burrows-Giles opinion, such constructions are accorded very great weight and, as that Court went on to say, when consistent and unchallenged for over a century are almost conclusive that consistent construction by Congress of its authority under the Copyright and Patent Clause now has lasted from the 105th -- from the first through the 105th Congress. 
It is consistent with what the law of England was from the Statute of Anne -- Yes, but take one of the early extensions, just extending a -- an already granted patent to an inventor for an extra 10 years. 
Maybe Congress did it, but maybe it acted improperly when it did it. 
Well, that -- it seems to me that there may be -- this is -- the clause itself is a very, very broad grant. 
I don't think -- and the petitioners expressly disclaim the assertion that any substantive limitations in the "Promote the- Clause. 
It's not just the right -- No, the reason for the right in the first place was to encourage invention. 
It includes the dissemination of the work, not necessarily -- Dissemination alone? 
I'm -- for purposes of my thinking about it, I'd like to know, imagine we have just dissemination. 
The only justification for the extension, there is no other, is dissemination of a work that is already in existence. 
Well, I think that it could very well be yes, for the reason that in the 1790 statute the Congress specifically was aware of -- that there were State copyright laws which didn't last as long as the Federal statute. 
So in your opinion, in my example, if you recall it -- It's -- -- your answer would be, if Congress tomorrow wants to give a copyright to a publisher solely for the purpose of reproducing and disseminating Ben Jonson, Shakespeare, it can do it? 
Well, because I don't think that a per -- I don't think there is a per se rule that should apply here because this is a grant of Congress, to Congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial. 
The harms that seem to be caused by it, the extension, I've listed as follows, approximate numbers, made up, but magnitude correct. 
Harm number 2. 
The cost of that, on my numbers in here, made up, at least a billion dollars, or they can't find the people at all and get permission, an innumerable cost, un -- valuable cost to people who want to use it. 
On the plus side I see uniformity, dissemination, and -- now, you tell me. 
It's carried out, as the economists do, to three decimal points, divide by 100 for the probability of your ever having such a work, and you get virtually zero, no difference between this and a perpetual copyright. 
We -- the Copyright Clause incentive provides incentives not just for -- not just to the creators, but to the disseminators, the publishers, the broadcasters, the film companies. 
Well, I think again that illustrates why the authority is vested in Congress to make these judgments rather than in courts to make these affect whether the judgments, because we're not talking about the effect on an individual author, or an individual creator. 
I -- one wonders what was in the principle 13 difficult principle given to Congress and has been exercised so repeatedly out there that would ever kick in? 
What I submit -- well, first of all, even the petitioners acknowledge that, as far as prospective limits are concerned, that isn't a judgment that this Court is being made to ask and, in fact, the petitioners acknowledge that it isn't a judgment that this Court should make, so the only point that the petitioners -- Well, if Congress says we're going to grant this copyright indefinitely, forever -- That would seem -- -- that violates the limited term, does it not? 
And anything that -- In Victorian England you could buy a box seat for 900 years. 
Well -- I mean, we know that. 
Something that was the functional equivalent of an unlimited time would violate the Copyright Clause, but the Framers specifically did not put in numbers. 
Thomas Jefferson suggested that a number should be put in. 
Why -- their argument is precisely that, a limited time doesn't mean anything unless it means, once you have established the limit for works that have been created under that limit, that's the end. 
With the exception of a limitation which illustrates the distinction between forever on the one hand and a definite number on the other, is there any limitation in the clause? 
The work has already been created, but the artists that are creating works day in and day out take into consideration the fact that Congress has decided, there's an ease of administration -- But for them, they get the benefit of the longer term if you don't apply it to an existing copyright. 
We're not just -- because we're not just talking about the author. 
There were numerous hearings, there were testimony by the folks that represent the same position as petitioners here as to why this shouldn't be done, why it should be that this done. 
I mean, it's a penny on 1,000, or probably a lot less than that, frankly. 
The -- as we described in our brief, in pages 34 through 36, I believe it is in our brief, that the concerns about the limitation on exploitation and the limitation of a copyright period in Europe is based upon the country of origin of the work and the shortest time available. 
The petitioners are only saying that there shall be a per se rule that the word "limited times," means unchangeable times. 
That -- but the answer to that, Justice Ginsburg, I submit, is found in the Necessary and Proper Clause, and this Court's interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause as to the extent that this Court would find or not find that the judgment made by Congress with respect to the implementation of this very broad power is convenient or useful in terms of the achievement of the 2 goals. 
Is that your argument? 
Is it also your argument that even if you cannot trace that kind, or at least plausibly argue that there could be that kind of a causal benefit, that it would still be constitutional, because you should judge the extension simply as contributing to a general system, one feature of which is that from time to time there may be retrospective extensions, and so long as that general system induces the creation of works, or the dissemination of works, or the preservation of works, so long as the general system works, there is no review, no limitation on the tinkering that can be done, even retrospectively? 
I think that's a fair statement of an argument that we have made and articulated in the brief -- Okay. 
Yes, Justice Scalia, and the examples that are -- Can I ask you, why is it enormously inequitable if they get exactly what they were entitled to at the time they made the work? 
I think that's not an unreasonable expectation at all, Justice Stevens, because that was the premise of the -- That is the way it's always been done. 
That's -- But there was one -- Justice Breyer brought up Ben Jonson, so -- this case doesn't involve works that are already in the public domain. 
Why not? 
If the equity argument under the Necessary and Proper Clause justifies extension of the copyright for those whose copyright will expire tomorrow if it's not extended, in order to put them on parity with those getting copyrights for new works, why doesn't it apply to the copyright, the holder of the copyright that expired yesterday? 
Something that has already gone into the public domain, which other individuals or companies or entities may then have acquired an interest in, or rights to, or be involved in disseminating -- And if you don't -- This is a rational -- If you don't draw the line there, then Ben Jonson certainly gets recopyrighted. 
Oh, I concede that it's a bright line, but it's a bright line that would have -- Except Congress chose this one and didn't choose the other one. 
I agree, and this Court has -- we're not just talking about the judgment of the Congress of the -- the 105th Congress in 1998. 
Well, there was an interest in having a uniform rule, and that's precisely why the Framers created the Copyright Clause in the Constitution, but there was copyright protection in some States, there wasn't copyright protection in other States, and what we know from the decision of this Court in the Wheaton decision is that there was not a common law copyright in existence. 
Now, the petitioners make this quid pro quo to draw the line as well as in how long a line I agree, and this Court has -- just talking about the judgment of the Congress the 105th Congress in 1998. 
That simply does not make any sense. 
Go ahead. 
I wonder, is there any review there? 
I mean, that would seem -- where this equity idea is the camel and the production idea is the gnat, and is there any -- can we say something like that, or does Congress have total leeway in respect to -- Well, it -- -- who they want to give the money to, basically? 
We have the adoption of copyright terms which are consistent, generally speaking, with copyright terms which exist in the European Union, our principal competitor, and in connection with international treaties. 
You might have made the balance, that delicate balance that this Court has referred to, in another way, but that is something that Congress, through its ability to gather facts and make balances, is quintessentially capable of doing, and that is where the Framers vested the responsibility, and what this statute does is to favor, if at all, the creator with respect to the utilization of these rights, as opposed to the person who wishes to copy the creator. 
Thank you. 
Mr. 
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS General Olson has been perfectly clear in setting out the structure of the Government's argument. 
Now, were this the first time this Court had considered Congress's copyright authority, that might be a plausible argument, but the very first time this Court ever struck down a law of Congress as exceeding Article I, section 8 power was in the context of the Copyright Clause. 
The Feist opinion very clearly sets out the implied limits, a per se limit for originality, for the reasons Justice Breyer was trying to get me to say. 
Those limits make no sense under the reasoning the Government has offered. 
Now, we offer a simple way to make this clear, express limit make sense, and that is precisely the understanding we suggest that existed in 1790. 
Now, that might be a delicate balance, that they give the author 99.8 percent and the public .2 percent, but in my mind, that's delicate in a very different sense of that term. 
Thank you, Mr. 
The case is submitted. 
Good evening, from Wake Chapel at Wake Forest University at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 
Welcome to this second election 2000 debate between the Republican candidate for president, George W. 
These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. 
Only the subjects tonight and the questions are mine. 
The only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever, ever exceed two minutes. 
Good evening, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. 
Let's see if we can do the same tonight, or come close. 
One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single-most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. 
I have, I have. 
What's in the best interests of our people? 
Is it in our nation's interests? 
Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests. 
I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president. 
He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him. 
One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people. 
The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. 
So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States. 
Yes, Jim. 
I see it as a question of values. 
And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans. 
As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. 
The power of example is America's greatest power in the world. 
It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. 
We've got to deal with things like racial profiling. 
Should the people of the world look at the United States, Governor, and say, should they fear us, should they welcome our involvement, should they see us as a friend, everybody in the world? 
It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy. 
If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us. 
And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. 
We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us. 
I agree with that. 
I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway. 
But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world. 
The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough. 
But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent. 
Yes, it does. 
We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people. 
We can lend money but we have to do it wisely. 
So we have to be guarded in our generosity. 
New question. 
The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. 
The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. 
But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. 
But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. 
They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. 
Governor? 
Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. 
I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend. 
Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. 
The sanctions are being violated. 
One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace is to be able to say to the Saddam Husseins of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends. 
After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. 
So you don't believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides and resolve this right now? 
Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker. 
I do. 
When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place. 
This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table. 
But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East. 
That's hard to tell. 
Saddam Hussein, you mean, get him out of there? 
We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be. 
We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East. 
You feel that is a failure of the Clinton administration? 
But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there. 
Now I want to go further. 
I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it. 
Did he state your position correctly, you're not calling for eliminating the sanctions, are you? 
Let's go on to Milosevic and Yugoslavia, and it falls under the area of our military power. 
Should the fall of Milosevic be seen as a triumph for U.S. 
I'm pleased the president made the decision he made. 
Yes, I think it is. 
I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force. 
I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. 
It is important for NATO to have it work. 
And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. 
Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one. 
I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war. 
When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. 
Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved. 
He should be held accountable. 
In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. 
ought to get involved with troops. 
Trying to figure out who the questioner was. 
I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took. 
Well, let's stay on the subject for a moment. 
I figured this out; in the last 20 years there have been eight major actions that involved the introduction of U.S. 
Let me name them. 
If you had been president for any of those interventions, would any of those interventions not have happened? 
Sure. 
I thought that was a mistake. 
I supported that. 
I supported that. 
Yes, I voted for it, supported it. 
Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered. 
It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Want me to do it with you? 
Make a couple comments. 
Somalia. 
And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building. 
I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests. 
I wouldn't have supported either. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
And Bosnia. 
But the reverse side of the question, Governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994. 
intervention, no intervention from the outside world. 
It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda. 
The administration, seem like we're having a great love for us tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. 
My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. 
We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. 
One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. 
If we have allies in the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. 
Now, we have tried -- our countries tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance. 
But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission. 
Well, I understand, and Africa is important. 
We have to work with Nigeria. 
But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere. 
I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide. 
But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim. 
You mentioned Haiti. 
I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile. 
It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before. 
I don't think we agree on that. 
I think we have to be very reticent about that. 
All these other countries are looking to us. 
And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. 
We still have lots of troops in Europe. 
We were nation building. 
But it was also military. 
We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back. 
military that you would bring home if you become president? 
I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy. 
And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans. 
No one is suggesting that. 
And there is an example. 
Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia. 
The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia. 
Is that on your radar screen? 
Our military is meant to fight and win war. 
And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military. 
I don't disagree with that. 
That's what we did in Haiti. 
And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. 
And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended. 
And that's why I've supported building up our capacity. 
He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say. 
And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military. 
contributions to overseas development assistance is lower now almost than it has ever been. 
Do you think -- what is your -- what is your idea about what the United States' obligations are? 
Well, I mentioned Third World debt. 
That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations. 
I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform. 
One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation. 
It needs to be available for emergency situations. 
But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves. 
No, I would make some changes. 
I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable. 
The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. 
I've worked on this issue. 
And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. 
The world has come together, as I said, they're looking to us. 
Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. 
I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. 
It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role. 
I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. 
And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government. 
I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. 
I think we can help. 
But take Russia, for example. 
The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. 
Mr. 
But Russia has to make the decision. 
So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you. 
We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. 
Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course. 
No, let's move on. 
First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice presidential debate last week. 
Yes, I would. 
And I know it's been going on a long time. 
Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. 
I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level. 
I don't think they ought to be held guilty. 
And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence. 
Yeah. 
I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training. 
And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity. 
You have a different view of that. 
On hate crimes laws? 
We've got one in Texas. 
The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them? 
A jury found them guilty. 
And it's the right cause. 
So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces. 
And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more. 
They're tolerant people. 
It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them. 
Like you said, Arab-Americans, but also Hispanics, Asians, as well as Blacks in this country. 
In public education when we just move children through the schools. 
She's right. 
I mean every child. 
Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. 
We can do better in our public schools. 
One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. 
Is anybody being profiled? 
It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. 
And if they are, fine. 
And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. 
The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also. 
Hold on one second. 
Let's clear this up. 
Am I wrong about that? 
We do. 
And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. 
The death penalty. 
In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim. 
We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas. 
Sure. 
I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee. 
And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy. 
And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition. 
Absolutely. 
Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books. 
But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime. 
And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to deaths. 
New subject, new question. 
Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships. 
I'm not for gay marriage. 
And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act. 
But I think marriage is a sacred institution. 
I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas. 
But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman. 
I agree with that, and I did support that law. 
I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't. 
But I will be a tolerant person. 
I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman. 
Yes. 
What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian. 
Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress. 
Governor? 
I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation. 
I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life. 
Special rights, how does that affect gays and lesbians? 
But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. 
In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. 
If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. 
I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. 
Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. 
If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. 
And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. 
And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. 
There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. 
But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. 
I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. 
He is for registration of guns. 
The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. 
It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that. 
All right. 
Correct. 
Who would issue the -- The state. 
I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns. 
And the "Los Angeles Times" spent a lot of ink going into that. 
I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. 
Back to the question about the differences on gun control. 
Well, I'm not for photo licensing. 
Everybody believes that. 
You can't carry a gun into a school. 
But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. 
It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life. 
So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. 
So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. 
But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law. 
I also believe in the Golden Rule. 
We do have a serious problem in our culture. 
She's worked on it longer than I have. 
And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that. 
And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. 
Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. 
We added beds. 
And that's what needs to happen. 
If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important. 
As I was saying. 
What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now? 
Well, I've got a plan to do something about that. 
First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to. 
Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now. 
In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do. 
I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country. 
Secondly -- and they're good. 
Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets. 
If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power. 
I think that's the very best way to go. 
Vice President Gore? 
I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system. 
I want a smaller and smarter government. 
And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the "Los Angeles Times" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years. 
And I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here. 
49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care. 
First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system? 
Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. 
Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. 
And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999. 
We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured. 
Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct. 
And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests. 
There's -- you don't have to take my word for this. 
I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance. 
Let's let the governor respond to that. 
Are his charges correct? 
Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care. 
He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population. 
Let me just tell you who the jury is. 
There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me. 
So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around. 
We come together both Republicans and Democrats. 
The reason you brought this up, is it -- are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president? 
I think he's a good person. 
I believe him when he says that he has a good heart. 
But I think it's about his priorities. 
Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined. 
So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know. 
See, you know -- Let me ask -- First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course. 
That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending. 
The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. 
That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief. 
It's a totally different point of view. 
I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. 
We pay 4.7 billion. 
I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place. 
We're making really good progress. 
My priority is going to be the health of our citizens. 
And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. 
But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for American. 
I do. 
There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years. 
And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly. 
If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. 
They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market. 
And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time. 
We have to be bold. 
Now it's true that we disagree on this. 
He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
And Texas is number one in industrial pollution. 
And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy. 
Well, let me start with Texas. 
We reduced our industrial waste by 11%. 
Our water is cleaner now. 
A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers. 
I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. 
I think we need to have clean coal technologies. 
By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area. 
No excuses. 
In other words, there are practical things we can do. 
If you own the land, every day is Earth Day. 
Where do you see the basic difference in very simple terms in two or three sentences between you and the governor on the environment? 
I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming. 
I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies. 
We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said. 
I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way. 
Would you say it's a fundamental difference? 
Okay, sure. 
I just want to know for somebody -- we're getting close to the end of our time here. 
Vice President. 
Out in the west, yeah. 
That's not the way I would have done it. 
But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally. 
So long as people have input. 
I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously. 
And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions. 
Like Kyoto Treaty would have done. 
I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position. 
But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate. 
I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with. 
I think that we do. 
I'm a grandfather now. 
In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, "Where your heart is, there is your treasure also." And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them. 
I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. 
A profound scientist recently made a different -- Both of you have now violated -- excuse me. 
Hold that thought. 
I know, I know. 
I let you do it a moment ago. 
I apologize, Mr. 
You aren't allowed to do that either, see? 
Oh, you mean the rules. 
Go ahead. 
I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously. 
And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place. 
We may have different approaches. 
I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input. 
I feel very strongly the same place. 
New question. 
For you, Governor. 
You, your running mate, your campaign officials have charged that Vice President Gore exaggerates, embellishes and stretches the facts, etcetera. 
This is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on November 7? 
I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean. 
It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations. 
This isn't something new. 
The Earned Income Tax Credit, sorry. 
A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it? 
And so I think this is an issue. 
I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers. 
And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations. 
That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case. 
I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that. 
There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes. 
And we need to do something about that. 
But right away. 
But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people. 
That's going to be up to the people, isn't it? 
Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign. 
I hope they're not awful things. 
Well, what I mean is calling him a serial exaggerator -- I don't believe I've used those words. 
Maybe they have. 
And your campaign officials, Mr. 
The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials? 
Your -- I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy. 
Gentlemen, it's time to go to the closing statements. 
Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important. 
And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. 
I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. 
Because I want to give new choices to parents. 
I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. 
And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. 
If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority. 
You can't do both. 
I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support. 
Jim, thank you very much. 
Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening. 
There's too many issues left unresolved. 
I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future. 
No child should be left behind in America. 
I worry about morale in today's military. 
It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military. 
This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue. 
I want to do something about Social Security. 
I believe we can set our priorities. 
I believe in limited government. 
I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can. 
I'm asking for your vote, and God bless. 
Louis for the third and final debate. 
S. 
KERRY (MA) DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE BOB SCHIEFFER CBS ANCHOR Good evening from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. 
Tonight the topic will be domestic affairs, but the format will be the same as that first debate. 
I have not told the candidates or anyone else what they are. 
The candidate is allowed two minutes to answer. 
At my discretion, I can extend the discussion by offering each candidate an additional 30 seconds. 
A yellow light signals 15 seconds left. 
There are no opening statements, but there will be two-minute closing statements. 
Senator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight. 
Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight. 
And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. 
Mr. 
Will we ever be safe and secure again? 
We absolutely must be. 
Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it. 
And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. 
The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? 
People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. 
Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. 
So we can do a better job of homeland security. 
But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure. 
President, you have 90 seconds. 
I want to thank Arizona State as well. 
And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. 
Freedom is on the march. 
In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan. 
I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. 
At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. 
But absolutely we can be secure in the long run. 
Anything to add, Senator Kerry? 
When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped. 
Mr. 
Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. 
Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. 
We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden. 
No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected. 
Flu kills thousands of people every year. 
How did that happen? 
My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. 
We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. 
One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law. 
Senator Kerry? 
It's not working for the American family. 
82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 
All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1. 
This president has turned his back on the wellness of America. 
In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans. 
We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it. 
We're going to make it affordable and accessible. 
Mr. 
I would. 
I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for. 
That costs the government $7,700 per family. 
Time's up. 
Actually, it's not an empty promise. 
He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice. 
I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. 
But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it. 
We're not giving this away for nothing. 
Senator Kerry, a new question. 
You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. 
Health-care costs, as you are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. 
I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go. 
If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how. 
He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1. 
He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today. 
I'm going to change that. 
Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those. 
I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. 
I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education. 
We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. 
Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record. 
He voted to increase taxes 98 times. 
He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4. 
He talks about PAYGO. 
There is a tax gap. 
The middle class. 
I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. 
Let's go to a new question, Mr. 
Two minutes. 
We've expanded trade adjustment assistance. 
You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. 
But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. 
And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. 
And so we said: Let's raise the standards. 
No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. 
And that's what I would say to that person. 
I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally. 
Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. 
6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. 
But guess what, America? 
The fact is that he's cut job-training money. 
I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect. 
And it's still on jobs. 
So I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs? 
I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it. 
"And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, "No, I can't do that. 
So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, "Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. 
I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. 
And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here. 
The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. 
They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it. 
That's what the American worker wants. 
Mr. 
Whew! 
In his last litany of misstatements. 
We've increased Pell Grants by a million students. 
You know, he talks to the workers. 
That's money in your pocket. 
The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage. 
A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief. 
The way my opponent talks, he said, "We're going to spend the government's money. 
And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want. 
My opponent talks about fiscal sanity. 
He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times. 
Bob, anybody can play with these votes. 
I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. 
But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? 
But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. 
When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times. 
You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. 
But let's shift to some other questions here. 
You know, Bob, I don't know. 
I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. 
But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. 
The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution. 
After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution. 
You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. 
It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. 
But I'm concerned that that will get overturned. 
Senator Kerry? 
And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as. 
I think we have to respect that. 
I believe that. 
But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. 
You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. 
Senator Kerry, a new question for you. 
What is your reaction to that? 
I completely respect their views. 
And I grew up learning how to respect those views. 
I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. 
I believe that choice is a woman's choice. 
And that's why I support that. 
Wade. 
But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to. 
Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. 
I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me. 
There's a great passage of the Bible that says, "What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? 
" And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people. 
All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith. 
And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service. 
President? 
I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. 
It's a brutal practice. 
What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs. 
That's great. 
All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion. 
President, let's have a new question. 
And let's get back to economic issues. 
We're paying more. 
I would like to ask you: Who bears responsibility for this? 
Is it the doctors? 
Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration. 
Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. 
It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. 
Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. 
In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. 
Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology. 
We're changing the language. 
People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. 
And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care. 
The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs. 
In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada. 
The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada. 
The VA does that. 
We could have done that in Medicare. 
Medicare belongs to you. 
But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices. 
That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums. 
Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance. 
We got to have health care for all Americans. 
He has no record on reforming of health care. 
He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five. 
I came to Washington to solve problems. 
And so I led. 
Once again, the president is misleading America. 
So the president's wrong. 
And you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper 2 percent. 
I'd just ask you, where are you going to get the money? 
One called it fiction. 
The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple. 
The government doesn't require you to do anything. 
You choose your plan. 
And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. 
And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. 
I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them. 
If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American. 
C. 
We give you broader competition. 
Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. 
And I'm going to offer it to America. 
President? 
They analyzed the senator's plan. 
The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care. 
If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. 
It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance. 
I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice. 
And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. 
Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital. 
The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality. 
Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare. 
I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield. 
President? 
That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding. 
We're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country. 
Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years. 
President, the next question is to you. 
You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. 
So where do you get the money? 
gets elected, your check will be taken away. 
There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem. 
But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy. 
It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. 
I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust. 
I will work with Republicans and Democrats. 
It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I'll bring Republicans and Democrats together. 
But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children. 
You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts. 
Now, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from? 
He's broken the pay-as-you-go rules. 
In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party. 
We paid down the debt for two years. 
We're going to protect Social Security. 
I will not cut the benefits. 
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, says there's no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate. 
We may have to take some other reform. 
Not at all. 
This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on "Meet the Press" with Tim Russert in 1990-something. 
We fixed it. 
6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security. 
The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. 
I don't. 
And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country. 
And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary. 
The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing. 
6 million jobs. 
I have a plan to put America back to work. 
He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time. 
That's exactly where the tax cuts went. 
People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed. 
If you're married, you got tax relief. 
All of which was opposed by my opponent. 
People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down. 
And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs. 
I led the Congress. 
And now this economy is growing. 
But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners. 
It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low. 
President. 
Some people believe this is a security issue, as you know. 
And what do we need to do about it? 
We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border. 
It's a subject I'm very familiar with. 
Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. 
If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5. 
And that's what's happening. 
That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. 
See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it. 
If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border. 
Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty. 
If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too. 
Senator? 
The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob. 
He said he would reform it. 
Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11. 
It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly. 
We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows. 
President? 
They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas. 
He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that. 
Senator? 
The fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border. 
We have iris-identification technology. 
We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border. 
Well, I'm glad you raised that question. 
And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself. 
But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it. 
They don't want to raise the minimum wage. 
One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families. 
We also need to hold on to equal pay. 
They've cut it off. 
They don't enforce these kinds of things. 
We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream. 
I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage. 
But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to. 
It's to make sure we raise standards. 
The No Child Left Behind Act says, "We'll raise standards. 
But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. 
And we weren't diagnosing problems. 
And guess who would get shuffled through? 
And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it. 
In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now. 
Mr. 
He said -- and this will be a new question to you -- he said that you had never said whether you would like to overturn Roe v. 
So I'd ask you directly, would you like to? 
And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test. 
Senator Kerry, you'd like to respond? 
. 
You have 90 seconds. 
Well, again, the president didn't answer the question. 
I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution. 
So I don't intend to see it undone. 
But let me go a step further. 
I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school. 
Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens. 
Yes, sir? 
One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with. 
He talked about the unemployed. 
He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language? 
And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does. 
President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done. 
$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs. 
You have two minutes, sir. 
You agreed with him. 
Some of them say that it's a back-door draft. 
If you became president, Senator Kerry, what would you do about this situation of holding National Guard and Reservists for these extended periods of time and these repeated call-ups that they're now facing? 
Our military is overextended. 
In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. 
There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. 
And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure. 
I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith to the American people in the way that he took this nation to war. 
He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. 
And the result is our forces today are overextended. 
And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably. 
Mr. 
The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing. 
I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia. 
The people I talked to their spirits were high. 
They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country. 
In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test. 
I'll work with friends. 
Senator? 
In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation. 
But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard. 
The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force. 
You said that if Congress would vote to extend the ban on assault weapons, that you'd sign the legislation, but you did nothing to encourage the Congress to extend it. 
Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear. 
I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. 
But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. 
And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number. 
To me, that's the best way to secure America. 
I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban. 
I'm a gun owner. 
And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment. 
I'm also a former law enforcement officer. 
We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. 
Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. 
It encouraged them to do it. 
For you, Senator Kerry, two minutes. 
No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along. 
I'll give you an example. 
I was chairman of it once. 
We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country. 
They don't even fight to reach those goals. 
The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination. 
I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. 
During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. 
And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel. 
If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? 
Mr. 
Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus. 
And secondly, like my opponent, I don't agree we ought to have quotas. 
But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done. 
Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college? 
I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going. 
I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something. 
And that's hopeful, and that's positive. 
And I believe, I don't remember the quote exactly, but I believe you said you had checked with a higher authority. 
First, my faith plays a lot -- a big part in my life. 
And I do. 
I pray for strength. 
I pray for our troops in harm's way. 
You're equally an American if you choose to worship an almighty and if you choose not to. 
That's the great thing about America, is the right to worship the way you see fit. 
I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency. 
Somebody asked me one time, "Well, how do you know? 
" Religion is an important part. 
I believe that God wants everybody to be free. 
And that's been part of my foreign policy. 
And I can't tell you how encouraged I am to see freedom on the march. 
Senator Kerry? 
I think it's important and I share it. 
Everything is a gift from the Almighty. 
And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. 
And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith. 
I think we've got a lot more work to do. 
I think it's fair to say we've become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season. 
Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may. 
That's where we were. 
I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. 
I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today. 
Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues. 
I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans. 
And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America. 
President? 
I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas, and I was hopeful I'd be able to do the same thing. 
The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy. 
But Washington is a tough town. 
I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so. 
We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did. 
And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq. 
And it occurred to me as I came to this debate tonight that the three of us share something. 
We're all married to strong women. 
I'd like to ask each of you, what is the most important thing you've learned from these strong women? 
To stand up straight and not scowl. 
I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, "Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech. 
"Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal. 
And she speaks English a lot better than I do. 
But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush. 
When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue. 
I think you'll find somebody who might interest you. 
And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight. 
Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up. 
But I can take it. 
And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing. 
"Those are the three words that she left me with. 
They don't let me get away with anything. 
They surely don't let me do that. 
I've watched him with the first lady, who I admire a great deal, and his daughters. 
Senator Kerry, I believe you're first. 
More than ever, we need to be united as a country. 
I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger. 
I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world. 
We can lift our schools up. 
We can have health care for all Americans. 
Let me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security. 
I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. 
I ask you for your trust. 
Mr. 
In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee. 
And he said this about it. 
We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. 
Over the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods. 
We must never waver in the face of this enemy that -- these ideologues of hate. 
We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world. 
God bless you. 
President. 
Well, that brings these debates to a close, but the campaign goes on. 
Acephalous Friday, 07 May 2010 Because I've been grading all damn day and am as tired as a Swearengen of hearing other about the finished semesters of pretty much every other academic blogger, I thought that it might be best to avoid jealously lashing out and scribble a "Best of Acephalous 2009" post. 
What do I mean? 
Granted, the likelihood that I'm suffering from the identitarian equivalent of presentism is awfully high, but I honestly thought I'd written some of the posts from early 2009 in 2006 or so. 
Posted at 05:50 PM Comments Why is someone so young not having fun with friends on a Friday night. 
I should know. 
You need to try to have a life outside your computer. 
The post not only taught me something about the grammar of such images, but more importantly led to me realising that there is a grammar to look for in the first place. 
I also liked "Teaching the Overdetermined Image." Your takedown of Cashill and the whole Ayers-wrote-Dreams was excellent, and the Cruel_cruel_death post (you know what I'm talking about, right?). 
Posted by: Caio | Saturday, 08 May 2010 at 06:49 PM Agree with the previous two comments. 
Posted by: Martin Wisse | Sunday, 09 May 2010 at 01:19 AM What happened to your post that appeared in my RSS reader yesterday? 
I feel your British readers would appreciate that. 
I noted on Facebook that, from a statistical perspective, what makes baseball such an amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life and still see, on a daily basis, something you’ve never seen before. 
John Emerson responded with some humbug about it not being an inside-the-park grand slam, which made me remember that I had seen an inside-the-park grand slam at some time in the remote past. 
on 9 June 1985 , I watched Terry Pendleton hit an inside-the-park grand slam off Joe Sambito in a game the Cardinals would go on to win handily. 
This realization is obviously not of world-historical importance, merely a reminder that this thing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to human memory. 
That I can access detailed information about events I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely. 
Wow. 
I sometimes wish I could forget that Pendelton is the Braves hitting coach. 
Posted by: Chuck | Wednesday, 19 May 2010 at 06:16 PM He pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets, stayed for '85, then he pitched for the Red Sox against the Mets in '86 World Series. 
Now that I remember him, which I didn't before, I remember him as being the pitcher who'd pitched for 1) the team the Mets faced to get to the '86 Series and 2) the one they faced in it. 
Memory, as Gertrude Stein would say, is funny. 
What's really bothersome, though, is when you only remember things from your distant past. 
Posted by: John Emerson | Wednesday, 19 May 2010 at 07:02 PM A guess, but perhaps your grandfather's life at 22 was more interesting than the ensuing 70 yrs. 
Bouffant | Wednesday, 19 May 2010 at 08:54 PM You know what makes this post great? 
Posted by: tomemos | Wednesday, 19 May 2010 at 09:04 PM Yeah, I remember Sambito from the Astros (when the Braves were in the old NL West because it made sense to have a team 3,000 miles from most of their division rivals). 
But burned out toward the end. 
Posted by: Chuck | Thursday, 20 May 2010 at 12:14 PM >Prosthetic memory. 
Having given up on watching the actual sport, mention of baseball now only sparks memories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers. 
Plus, they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes. 
The Anti-Terrorist - Undermining The Motivation For Terrorism By Rev. 
BACKGROUND , September 11, 2004 Three years have now gone by since the September 11th attacks in 2001, and terrorism is a far greater threat to us now than it was then. 
And the serious targets have expanded to include civilians in Russia, India, Maylasia, the Philippines, Spain, and elsewhere, as well as Israel and its sole supporter, the United States. 
What could be more spectacular than the 9/11 attacks? 
Or massive bio-chemical attack! 
And proof that Bush has failed may come at any moment, explosively, with one big successful attack here in the USA. 
WHAT IS TERRORISM? 
NEUTRALIZING TERRORISM Our purpose here is to NEUTRALIZE TERRORISM by removing the motivation for it. 
We completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force, because brute force radicalizes the moderates, and they then join the terrorists. 
In all of these cases above, if the radical Muslims would cease their attacks, all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end. 
The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous. 
If the terrorist loses faith in the righteousness of his acts, he is less likely to perform them. 
- Framed Below): "Qur'an Forbids Terrorism" In every case of terrorism, we will find some kind of legitimate underlying grievance. 
Is this "negotiating with terrorists" or "trying to appease the terrorists," as some Israeli/NeoCons would try to say? 
BIG PICTURE A big picture of our entire Anti-Terrorism strategy can be found at our website => http://www.loveallpeople.org/defeatingterrorism.html . 
May God help us all. 
May God help us all. 
Jet Lag: Pathophysiology and Cures The longest Monday of my life I recently returned to the US from Australia. 
Crossing the date line messed up my sense of time enough without the added bonus of thinking I should be heading to bed just as the sun began to climb into the California sky. 
The catch-all name for circadian misalignment, the disruption of sleep cycles and circadian rhythms. 
The pathophysiology of jet lag Normally, two systems--the homeostatic system and the circadian system--work together to produce a 24-hour sleep cycle. 
The circadian system generates an alerting signal in opposition to this sleep drive, which, during the day, keeps a person from feeling increasingly sleepy. 
So we've got a nice cycle of sleep. 
For example, the circadian system may signal a person to be alert when it's not actually morning, or may be reduced during daytime hours, causing daytime sleepiness because the homeostatic sleep drive is no longer cancelled out. 
How do you beat jet lag? 
Studies have shown that without light cues, totally blind people tend to have free-running circadian rhythms with an average period of 24.5 hours, instead of the usual 24. 
Brighter light has more of an effect (such as the sun, at 3000 to 10,000 lux), though lower intensities (e.g., 100-550 lux) can produce changes. 
Alternatively, a person could wear very dark glasses, as light avoidance could help minimize the problems of light exposure at the wrong time of day or night. 
Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland at night; secretion is suppressed by light exposure, and as such, the hormone can be thought of as a "darkness signal." If doses of melatonin are administered in the morning, circadian rhythms will be shifted later; evening doses shift rhythms earlier. 
Slowly adjust your sleep schedule to match that of your destination, or keep your home sleep schedule for a while after you arrive. 
Use this method at your own risk. 
As you might guess, hypnotic medications combat insomnia and stimulants fight off daytime sleepiness pretty well, because by definition, that's what they do. 
Granted, caffeine subjects also took longer to fall asleep later and awoke more frequently, but that may be a risk you have to take. 
Of course, the only solution that will always work is time. 
UPDATE: ; I was alerted by a friend of the existence further research of which I was unaware: Another way to reset your sleep-wake cycle is to stop eating . 
The Fuller, Lu, & Saper paper [PDF], published in Science , discusses the mechanism, though a more recent paper argues that the Fuller et al. 
Orange-gold light filters into the grassy meadow, touching a row of canvas tents and the temple house beyond. 
This is the seat of His Holiness the Sakya Trizin in the United States, a Tibetan Buddhist monastery established nine years ago. 
The field work office at my college arranges this retreat every semester. 
I like learning new things, so I signed up. 
Medicine for one's mind The first evening, the twenty-something students--most from my college, four from another--gathered in the shrine room, sitting cross-legged on cushions as we listened to Khenpo Kalsang introduce Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. 
Take it through analysis, if there is some benefit in it for you." Religion, he said, is like a drugstore full of medicine. 
You believe the other medicine may have just as much value, but in other situations, not this one. 
When we talked about the giving, and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient beings (in the form of material items, kind words, protection, and so on), Khenpo Kalsang shared a story of the Buddha, and how the Buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat. 
"Only if you feel no regret," he said. 
This struck a chord. 
Knowing and understanding Later, I talked to the resident nun, Ani Kunga, about psychology and cognitive science. 
"Psychologists," she said, "study the brain and the self externally. 
All three examine the distinction between the self and others, between the observer and the observed, between knowing and the knower. 
But this doesn't mean that there isn't merit to such studies, nor that nothing of use can be learned in that way. 
During a second philsophy session, Khenpo Kalsang translated a sutra about a king who received advice from the Buddha. 
Sunshine melted lazily through the tree branches above, a breeze animating the branches' shadows so they danced between our cushions. 
The key message: "If there's something you can do, why are you unhappy? 
If there's nothing you can do, why are you unhappy?" Ani Kunga explained several off-session and one on-session technique for dealing with negative emotions (anger, hate, irritation, stress, jealousy, and so on). 
Stay tuned for a more in-depth post on the topic. 
But if no one shares their prayers, it will certainly do no good. 
If I stay still long enough, if I've achieved a relatively constant level of happiness and satisfaction, I forget that I can and should continue to seek out new ideas and approaches, and incorporate beneficial ones into my life. 
Ever onward and ever upward. 
I mean, sure, I could take my pick of popular New Year's resolutions ; I could decide, on the first day of the new year, that this year, I'll start exercising more and eating better, or that I'll spend more time with my family and friends, or that I'll learn a new skill. 
Making resolutions: It's about self-control The question Anirban Mukhopadhyay of the Hong Kong University and Gita Venkatarmani Johar of the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University asked is this: What determines how many goals a person will set, and how successful a person will be at achieving those goals? 
They suggested that what you believe about self-control affects the goals you set and achieve [PDF]. 
Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani discuss various lay theories of self-control, noting that the amount of self-control a person has can be seen as either an inherently limited or unlimited resource, and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed (the amount of self-control a person has can change over time, or not). 
So if you think you'll be able to achieve a goal, you're more likely to set it. 
If you believe self-control is malleable but limited, you'll set fewer goals. 
They propose that people with high self-efficacy--people who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence--will achieve more of their goals than people with low self-efficacy, who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability, and thus may simply give up. 
Each passage contained two paragraphs; the first discussed self-control either as limited or as unlimited, and the second discussed self-control as either malleable or fixed. 
The study was testing whether a belief in unlimited, malleable self-control would result in most resolutions, and indeed, this is what was found. 
Data from 130 new participants revealed that, as hypothesized, if the motivation & goals questionnaire were assessed first, then among the people who believed self-control is malleable, those who also believed self-control to be unlimited (vs. 
When lay theories were assessed first, this result reversed. 
The third study moved on to examine goal achievement, adding a measure to look at self-efficacy. 
In the first session , the 159 participants read passages about lay theories (much like in study one, but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation), listed the resolutions they were planning on making at New Years, rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions, and filled out individual difference measures (which included a self-efficacy scale). 
What does this mean for your resolutions? 
As shown in the first two studies, more goals were set by people who believe self-control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people--that is, if you expect more success, you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself. 
But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed. 
But in general, lay theories about self-control can determine how much success you'll expect (and thus, how many goals you'll set), and self-efficacy beliefs can determine how much success you'll actually have. 
& Johar, G.V. 
Where There Is a Will, Is There a Way? 
Varsity athletics: Credit or no? 
This proposal has been in the works for nearly two years, and at long last, folks are voting to approve it. 
As a member of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee and as a long-time varsity athlete, you might say I have particular stake in the proposal. 
It seems justified: Students can receive credit for participating in other extracurricular, faculty-supervised activities, such as the orchestra, the choir, and the repertory dance theatre, so why not varsity athletics? 
If you get credit for introductory P.E. 
But our school newspaper presents other arguments in favor, which Carolyn thinks are highly unjustified: On top of everything, we must remember that varsity athletics present a considerable time commitment. 
If I cared more about other activities, I'd do those instead. 
Carolyn's supporting example, that higher level courses with more difficult and plentiful homework are worth the same amount of credit as introductory 100-level courses, drives this point home. 
Students choose to be varsity athletes of their own accord. 
Athletes shouldn't get special privileges simply because they're athletes. 
Sacrifices must be made, sure: Dance party on Friday night, or overnight travel to a competition? 
You learn stuff, too The article continues: While athletes will continue to be held to the College’s rigorous academic standards, the athletics credit could discourage a varsity athlete from unnecessarily taking on five academic credits while in their athletic season. 
I'd like to be known that students who have trouble balancing tough course loads and time-consuming extracurriculars have always had the option of taking a lighter load or dropping an extracurricular. 
Students who aren't varsity athletes could add an easy P.E. 
Students who can balance their work and their sport will continue to do so. 
thus negating the need for an overload form if taking five courses. 
Academics are officially what college is about. 
Students' GPAs will, in part, determine what they are able to do with their lives. 
these I've learned from my sport and my coaches. 
But it's no less important. 
Detroit and the Myth of the $100 House | Uprooted, an eco/travel blog America's Rust Belt is a swath of cities and towns that boomed during the Industrial Era and now lie -- well, rusting -- as empty remainders of glory days past. 
The longtime center of American automotive manufacturing was gutted when the Big Three car companies simultaneously failed. 
What's left behind when an economy collapses? 
I'd read a New York Times article about some forward-thinking artist-types who bought a house in Detroit for $1,900 . 
Some of us (and lots of New Yorkers) pay that much in rent every month! 
The artist types notified their buddies, who moved in post haste. 
Really? 
Even if it was a real fixer-upper, even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in it, that'd still be a hell of a deal. 
So how can you buy an actual home for $100? 
The possibilities of this were fascinating. 
I pictured young artists owning homes, fixing up neighborhoods. 
We could take that oil-stained soil and those rusted factories, and create something new and beautiful. 
And so Quiet Earp and I did some research, and came up with a list of houses selling for under a grand. 
We picked two neighborhoods to cruise, and dove in. 
The place is practically deserted. 
Houses and businesses are boarded up, painted up, bombed out and falling down. 
Don't believe me? 
Truthfully, it wasn't about race: it was about being naive. 
Detroit is a ghost town, and it's inhabited by ghosts: the only people left here are those who can't or won't leave. 
They sit on the porch and watch the cars go by, watch the deals go down, watch their neighborhoods crumble. 
It "needed some work, a hole patched, some windows replaced." Well, I don't know what part of Detroit these folks live in, but the $100 houses I saw looked more like this: You see, abandoned houses in this town get set on fire. 
Wherever we went in those neighborhoods, one in four houses had been torched. 
We didn't slow down to take a photo, but I'll paraphrase: DON'T BURN HOUSES DOWN! 
Except that they obviously aren't. 
It's like the Wild West without the scenery, the gold, and the hope. 
Ultimately, I do believe that change will come to Detroit. 
Long story short: Yes, you can buy a house in Detroit for $100. 
Cheers to Toby Barlow , who inspired my trek to Detroit, and who believes in a happier, greener future.

Thank you for this info. 
Sep, 2009 at 10:06 am Please track down and watch a movie called "Detroit: A City to Yourself", by Nicole MacDonald. 
Most poignantly, it talks about Hurricane Katrina, which focused attention on rebuilding another city with this level of devastation, and how without a single catastrophic event to blame for it, Detroit's decay has gone unsympathetically ignored. 
About the pop fiction which explores the concept of a post-human world, and how it already exists now. 
HOWEVER ... 
There are industrial spaces being turned into low-rent artist lofts and business incubators. 
(west of Livernois around McNichols). 
And there's always Belle Isle. 
Oh, and entry is free, so it's available to anyone regardless of economic status. 
Within a hundred yards of each other. 
There's a whole street being taken over by artists, Farnsworth between Moran and McDougall. 
A few weeks ago, someone broke into their shed to steal their garden tools. 
Whoever took that stuff is probably using it in their own garden. 
Jessica 19. 
You are exactly the kind of person who gives me back the hope I lost on my way into town. 
Love the fact that people are stealing garden implements (though it's still sad that they need to). 
And when I'm in the area again, I'll go out to Belle Isle and think long&hard about the future of American cities--as I'm sure you do occasionally too. 
Sep, 2009 at 10:17 pm Well, growing up not far from Detroit myself, I would point out a few things: 1. 
See, there's a wee bit of loyalty to the Big 3 and driving a foreign car doesn't really scream "solidarity" to those struggling to survive. 
You think I'm kidding, but I couldn't be more serious -- that Honda is a visceral reminder for people of how the American consumer has left Detroit in the dust. 
But its not going to happen with the investment of $100 into a single house. 
3. 
They lack the means to build her back to her former glory, but she won't be abandoned. 
I've never been there, but ever since that mad, possessed American History Professor I had, I've been haunted by Detroit.

Everybody wins.

Have the great fortunes earned in trust as "American" for American investment here in America, really migrated to the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hang-Seng markets, converted to safer "Yuan" and invested in China's wealth?

I agree -- Democrats, like country music, have disappointed me too many times in the past for me to keep on listening.

A $1,000 house, which could be fixed up into maybe a $30-40,000 house comes with a tax bill of $4-6K per year! 
Additionally, even if you paid cash for the house, you'd probably want to carry some homeowner's insurance with all the inherent risks to the property (arson, vandalism), and I'm sure it's sky-high, given those risks.

Filed under: Christine O'Donnell, Election 2010, Sarah Palin, Teabaggers, Wingnuts Posted By Bob Cesca | October 19, 2010 2:43 PM Comments I heard this same accusation on Kos today, that the audience is laughing AT Christine O'Donnell on the first thing she says, but I disagree entirely: On THAT point, HER supporters are laughing at COONS, it's absolutely a "She's got YOU, DUMBASS!!" laugh, the sort of "Oh-No-She-D'I'INT!" laugh you'd hear from a studio audience when the slightly stupid but affable and hitherto ineffective Dunce Character finally gets a zinger in on the Handsome Lead. 
Those are hoots and calls of SUPPORT for O'Donnell supposedly putting one over on Coons, they aren't laughing at her. 
Posted by: ELDING at October 19, 2010 2:52 PM Hilarious. 
But it's obvious that O'Donnell thinks they're laughing at him, not her. 
She thinks she just scored mucho points on Baldy. 
They routinely claim that the establishment of religion clause doesn't mean what everyone else thinks it means. 
Looks at me, I wins a big arguments and I poops my pants. 
I love when ignorant fucks like O'Donnell and her little orcling hordes make huge category mistakes like this. 
They should have applauded, that would have settled this matter for good. 
Posted by: ELDING at October 19, 2010 3:11 PM Well ELDING, its already being reported that it was HER that was clueless so Coons gets the last laugh on that. 
I mean, it could be some of her supporters infiltrated, but I truly believe there would've been lots of catcalling, etc. 
Posted by: pea at October 19, 2010 3:30 PM Yeah, Pea, you have a point there, but still: The laughter doesn't sound incredulous to me, it sounds appreciative and snarky. 
Posted by: ELDING at October 19, 2010 3:53 PM well, keep in mind that all of them probably know what a freak she is. 
I know if I had the opportunity to attend a Sarah Palin rally, I'd be overjoyed to hear some incredible stupid falling out of her mouth. 
the debate was at a LAW SCHOOL. 
Not a snowballs chance in hell. 
"It's one thing to not know the 17th Amendment or some of the others, but most Americans do know the basics of the First Amendment." O'Donnell didn't respond to reporters who asked her to clarify her views after the debate." Posted by: Big_Ben at October 19, 2010 5:48 PM Anyone who says "Evolution is only a THEORY...it's not a fact" is so stupid; so utterly fucking brainless, uneducated, ignorant, clueless and unread they should immediately be sterilized on the slim chance that there's a genetic component to their imbecility. 
Not knowing what the constitution says when asked is bold font black over white. 
As a defender, you can say, "well, she believes church and state are indivisible, so do I." But you can't say she knows the constitution when she clearly does not. 
It's hilarious when republicans who voted for Bush twice and approved the majority of the way through(approval among republicans was pretty consistent)are telling me about all the mistakes Obama makes and imparting their Bush-loving "wisdom" to those less in-the-know. 
Make no mistake, I'm laughing AT you, Tea Party Republican people. 
That's the real "busted!" moment here, if you ask me. 
Wingnuts will turn blue arguing about a Christian nation and constitution, but not knowing two amendments, as a person running to uphold and defend the constitution containing those amendments, this clip exposes her and the Tea Party faithful as constitutional frauds. 
There's no grey area, here. 
As someone trying to get a government job with great benefits where the qualification is basically, "take this constitution and defend it with your life," Tea Party Republicans spend an awful lot of time tearing it up and reassembling the pieces to their acquired tastes. 
Slightly off-topic, I've been spending a lot of time on potential swing vote forums adding fact to fiction. 
If you think Bush was good enough to vote for twice, and you're one of the 60 million McCain/Palin people, your qualifications and insight, like Christine O'Donnell's, are comical at best. 
Posted by: Irish Girl at October 19, 2010 5:53 PM It's beyond frustrating to me, as someone who has studied Constitutional Law, who competed on the the national level on it in law school, and who published an article on it, to hear people who clearly haven't done the first of these talk about it as if they know better than I do what the Constitution says, means, and is all about. 
Posted by: GrafZeppelin127 at October 19, 2010 6:41 PM I thinks this illustrates their biblical view of the Constitution, and by that I mean they regard it the same way as they regard the Holy Bible. 
Oh, and like the Holy Bible, that we mere mortals are not supposed to question or interpret, they'll let us know what it really means and that will often conflict with what it actually says. 
Except for, you know, maybe an amendment barring gay marriage. 
Give 'em a few minutes, though. 
Posted by: Nanotyrannus at October 19, 2010 7:19 PM @GrafZeppellin127 In answer to your question -- where do you go from there? 
they believe the President is not an American. 
they don't understand that "freedom of speech" doesn't mean freedom from consequences. 
they horde food because glenn beck told them so -- they conflate their "movement" with the civil rights movement --they "detain" reporters, on public property, for the crime of asking questions... 
they're crazy -- plain and simple and it's really, really sad. 
The debate was at Widener Law School. 
If they were, they'd be reacting after his comment (and probably booing and calling him a liar) rather than reacting after her comment. 
They would not believe you if you parted the sea for them first. 
While it can be personally satisfying to present all your little ducks in a row, they will never stop erroneously knocking the damn ducks out of line. 
The separation between church and state is what saves us from SHARIA LAW! 
She's not running to win, and if you think she is, you're not paying attention. 
The constant television appearances for the last decade or so. 
The strategy is this: be as foolish as possible, so no one anticipates you actually knowing anything. 
Go on the circuit as a passionate advocate for whatever cause you choose to co-opt. 
In Palin's case, it's the crypto-fascism that oozes within the GOP. 
Do you really think a serious candidate would go around asking for hints during a debate? 
O'Donnell is not that stupid. 
Sorry. 
Poke fun all you want, but at least be realistic with yourselves: you have just as much fun as they're having. 
This is why they're not making a full investment in her. 
Posted by: Lexaburn at October 19, 2010 11:17 PM Elvis, having watching the video several times, I have to disagree. 
However, she clearly thinks she that she has scored a huge win and that the audience was on her side. 
Posted by: DC at October 19, 2010 11:23 PM Oh, and ELDING, their reaction stems from the fact that she broached the subject again after the moderator moved on. 
She did it on purpose, not to further the discussion, but to establish that, yes, she is a dependable dumbass. 
It if really is a game for O'Donnell, then what's the end game? 
Being a perpetual campaigner can only get you so far, and if they don't intend to win after getting the nomination, then that con game is limited. 
Posted by: Broadway Carl at October 20, 2010 12:29 AM @Nicole, hi! 
I've been awol due to having a baby....little Liam was born on 9/21 (a couple of weeks early but he's doing well). 
To tell the truth, I can't tell you her actual "endgame," per se, but if I had a guess it would be an extended stint on a cable news channel. 
Palin took standards out of the equation when she quit her job. 
Well, Palin did anyway. 
My friend describes her as a "bad actress" primarily, that co-opts "conservativism," but doesn't necessarily cling to it as some may believe. 
O'Donnell is described as a normal conservative Republican woman by my friend. 
That is the lifestyle choice she has made, and she's sticking with it. 
However, I can't be too conclusive... 
Do not try to make sense out of anything of this if you're not thinking like a...celebrity of whatever quality, let's say. 
Go through all, and see if her point of view EVER evolves beyond the con-servative blather or the crank conspiracy theories. 
What exactly is she adding to these conversations? 
It's a perpetual cycle. 
You see how Rove immediately rejected her. 
In fact, my theory is that Rove wasn't so much as rejecting her, as limiting her role within the media environment. 
This all comes from my observing her debate performances, as well as her more recent TV appearances. 
Palin's taking time away from them, but she has her own plans, which have yet to be revealed (though they may be all too obvious). 
It's an odd combination - knowing you don't really have a solid grasp on a subject, but still being convinced that one's core principals are enough to overcome any obstacle. 
She's a Jesus freak. 
The only reason she's a Republican / Tea Party gangster is because her brand of theocracy and batshit stupidity would simply never fly anywhere else. 
Facts don't matter. 
That she lies about her academic credentials, inflates beyond all reason and truth the actual degree of study she has accomplished, does not in any way diminish her insistence that she IS highly educated - really VERY knowledgeable about all of these things she doesn't know about. 
She read a pamphlet from the Discovery Institute that totally explains the difference between Creationism and Intelligent Design...which are not the same things, not at all, and anyone who says they are is just wrong. 
But fuck it. 
And if you disagree with her, then you are properly an object of scorn and derision for being so poorly informed about things. 
She may well know that she's unelectable. 
Christine O'Donnell doesn't have a hidden agenda. 
As for why she consistently gets to appear on television: She's fuckable, in that weird Sarah Palin way that makes me recoil in horror and wonder what the fuck is wrong with anyone who would touch those women with their worst enemy's cock. 
She KNOWS things, see? 
Frankly I think it's the result of the move in the 70's and 80's to tell students that they were ALL special; that no one was any better or any smarter than anyone else; that everyone has a RIGHT to their own opinion; to make sure that everyone who played the game got a trophy. 
YOU don't know what you're talking about!" Knowing she's going to lose is not the same thing as running TO lose... 
She thinks she's right today, and she will think she's right after being stomped to death at the polls. 
Posted by: cousinavi at October 20, 2010 4:43 AM Lex - Thanks for the clarification. 
But I'm still going to think that her smile wasn't so much that she's in on the joke as it was she really does think she knows what she's talking about. 
To just shrug your shoulders and throw a hail mary pass with a smile on your face would be suicidal. 
Posted by: Broadway Carl at October 20, 2010 9:56 AM Avi- I agree with you completely, except that I believe the "everyone is special" crowd started in the 90's. 
The "entitlement because I deserve it" generation is currently in their early to mid 20's. 
Fermentation: The Daily Wine Blog Eminent Domain Used To Usurp Wine Label Real Estate I was disappointed, though not surprised, to see that today a conjunctive labeling law dictating that "Sonoma County" be placed on every label on wines produced from grapes grown in Sonoma County was unanimously passed by the California Legislature . 
According to Noreen Evans, an Assembly sponsor of the bill, this new conjunctive labeling law "requires that any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located entirely within Sonoma County - – like Russian River Valley or Dry Creek Valley - must also include the word "Sonoma County" on the label, starting in 2014. 
Beginning in 2014, "Sonoma County" will receive a tremendous boost in recognition due to the conjunctive labeling law that forces vintners to add more wording to their labels—whether they think the words "Sonoma County" help or hurt their marketing efforts. 
They point to the prestige that the "Napa Valley" designation carries. 
It has to do entirely with the promotional effort that has gone into making "Napa Valley" a place associated with great wines. 
The vintners in Sonoma County simply can't make a case for "Sonoma County" having any meaning or for a region as vast as "Sonoma County" delivering any degree of quality to the grapes. 
This is an example of a County usurping the private label real estate, and it's very valuable real estate, for the sake of promoting something that is of little use to private commercial interests.

And I am really pissed. 
I've got real skin in this game. 
Our best option looks like we will go to "North Coast" or "California" for our front label appellation, and discuss the grape source, vineyard name and meaningful AVA on the back label. 
I estimate the value to be in six figures, and we are a small winery. 
Eminent domain is exactly right - this is nothing less than governmental "taking." The legislators who backed this should be ashamed.

I support the new labeling requirement. 
Sonoma county now is as good or better than those early Napa vintages. 
I suppose the new law is all Sacramento hype. 
I admit I have voted for the bill's authoress. 
The ambience in the town Sonoma is only an enclave; it is rightfully proud of its heritage as a village, and for its viticultural traditions. 
August 30, 2010 at 01:24 PM Nick Perdiew said in to JohnLopresti... 
What do you make of the fact that vintners *already* are free to put Sonoma County on any label they want? 
August 31, 2010 at 10:40 AM JohnLopresti said... 
I can see Tom W's concerns, too. 
One rambling article's author counted 16 occurrences of the word Napa on the newly designed label of a famous budget wine producer's 2005 Napa cabernet sauvignon.

what business is it of State government what terminology goes on wine labels? 
and how can the state legislature single out two counties (first Napa, now Sonoma) for this treatment? 
I had thought of the kiltman with respect to a new AVA in Yorkville highlands, thinking the Scot might have interest in playing the bagpipes in the uplands. 
It's easy to get lost in nomenclatures, when one is striving for new concepts. 
Winkler heat summation datapoints also clarified several decades ago some of the plant physiologic underpinnings of why Napa county and Sonoma county were the natural leaders in premium winegrape production. 
September 01, 2010 at 04:22 PM JohnLopresti said... 
OK, so here's the real requirement: "Any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area established yada yada, that is located entirely within yada yada, shall bear the designation "Sonoma County" on the label in a type size not smaller than two millimeters on containers of more than 187 milliliters or smaller than one millimeter on containers of 187 milliliters or less." If I recall correctly, this is almost exactly the same as the requirement for the government warning type size. 
But this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands "Napa Valley", in addition to simply "Rutherford", be placed on these wines. 
Such an association will not be made with "Sonoma County" wines...ever. 
Perhaps the proponents of the law are not doing the job they were hired to do, perhaps the SCV needs a more passionate communicator on their marketing team, putting together the quality promotion you suggest is impossible. 
That, the fact that their wines cost less on average, and the wineries are friendlier, less snooty is a compelling story to get out to the public. 
You suggest that this is a bad law, that Sonoma County will never be associated with high quality wine in the way Napa County is. 
I have confidence they will change, retool, improve, live up to their responsibilities. 
Selling the magic of Sonoma County wines is easy. 
5034 . 
But what is truly remarkable (and likely a result of the wholesalers' hubris stemming from 75 years of being granted government welfare) is their willingness to misrepresent facts, ignore the truth, and mislead in their defense of H.R. 
For the sake of context and setting the record straight, this post address many of the misrepresentations and misleading claims made at the middlemen's disingenuous new website. 
is under attack. 
Even in the wake of successful suits that challenged the protectionist laws that wholesalers originally pushed, the state retained extraordinarily broad authority to maintain a robust system of alcohol controls. 
As for those that have "concern", let's recall that it's only a tiny fraction of state alcohol regulators, that there is no formal support from state attorneys general, only a mere handful of public health advocates, a selection of recipients of campaign contributions from wholesalers and wholesalers themselves that support H.R. 
"According to a recent national poll conducted by the Center for Alcohol Policy, 79% of respondents support the right of individual states to set their own laws and regulations surrounding the sale of alcohol and 87% agree that state and local laws regarding alcohol regulations should be decided by lawmakers and citizens, not by judges." I'm shocked, shocked i say, that the "center for alcohol policy" is an arm of the national beer wholesalers association and that it would conduct a poll that finds results supporting those that funded the poll. 
On the "Fact v. 
It does not preempt a state law that allows direct shipping. 
H.R. 
And we know such laws would be introduced into various states since wholesalers have seen to it that such laws have been introduced into state legislatures for the past 20 years. 
5034 would allow states to pass laws that make consumers receipt of a wine by in-state shippers legal while making receipt of a wine by out-of-state shippers punishable to a greater degree than rape, home invasion or selling cocaine to children. 
Better to call the introduction of H.R. 
It's no coincidence that brewers large and small, wineries, spirit producers and importers, retailers, wine education organizations, wine consumers and free trade organizations all oppose H.R. 
"This bill does not amend or alter the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) which provides federal guidelines in many of these areas" No it doesn't "amend" the faa act. 
To quote from H.R. 
5034 "does not amend" federal regulations on alcohol is a straight up misrepresentation. 
But this goes beyond even my expectation. 
5034 is precisely to overturn the granholm v. 
More importantly, the very language of H.R. 
All the state needs to do is offer the feeblest of justifications. 
Furthermore, note that wine retailers are not even covered by this duplicitous language on "justification". 
"Over half the states have been sued challenging their alcohol laws.

Checks to be made at the point of delivery of the wine. 
Constitution." Judges never have set policy. 
This is the big lie the wholesalers tell. 
After that, the state legislatures, in every state where litigation has affected badly crafted laws, went about legislating a fix. 
Constitution. 
Will they argue that state laws banning African-Americans from being distributors is legal under the 21st Amendment? 
The wholesalers would have argued that the racist "separate but equal" philosophy had no business being litigated and that we should wait for the legislatures that enacted the racist laws to overturn them with new laws. 
But of course, wholesalers know this. 
I urge all readers to sign up for those emails . 
It is published by the Specialty Wine Retailers Association and upon reading through it, you should find yourself feeling much cleaner and less soiled than after wading through the misrepresentations of the new wholesaler-sponsored website on H.R.

I am speechless. 
You do have a few valid points but they too may be predicated on false premise, I do not claim to be the all knowing expert. 
In short the wine has to go from point A to B in some way. 
It sounds like you would prefer you government welfare to go there instead? 
perhaps you forgot. 
In Oregon for instance there are about 60 wholesalers competing for partnerships on both the supply and the demand side, hardly the ideal monopoly situation. 
A very important point to remember: While large "commercial wineries" (Factory wine producers) may have the ability to market their own wine, smaller growers whom you seem to be so concerned about do not have the proper infrastructure to allow wine sales on line in many cases, let alone having their own transportation infrastructure.

Quite informative blog.My friends would definitely appreciate knowing these facts.

Oh, the numbers look good, but when you dig a little deeper a different picture emerges. 
What happened? 
Well, yes and no. 
But how did you come to get those fans? 
Let's look at my old favorite , TGI Friday's: If you can see this, then you might need a Flash Player upgrade or you need to install Flash Player if it's missing. 
Remember that ad? 
In fact, as I recall, they got over 1 million Facebook fans. 
But then something not so awesome happened. 
TGI Friday's completely lost control of the page and eventually doled out a lot of free burgers. 
But they decided to go the Social Media route. 
It's gone. 
How come? 
A TGI Friday's Facebook page does exist, with roughly a third of the fans they used to have. 
The ability to target your demo is really terrific, but you're in danger of creating a relationship with fans that ultimately is built on a "what have you done for me lately" foundation. 
You paid Facebook for the right to target them. 
This sets up a pattern where the consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with a tangible item, that is, free stuff. 
Want me as a fan? 
The point of Social Media isn't to distribute coupons and a real fan wants to engage with a brand for a whole host of reasons, often free / discounted product is the least of these reasons. 
As a reward for people who have engaged with the brand in a meaningful way. 
Recruit some friends and I'm happy to give you all some coupons.

He's also a very astute individual who understands how to use the media -- and various communication channels -- to his advantage. 
Lebron didn't play college basketball, he went straight from high school to the pros, and since joining the Cleveland Cavaliers he's won exactly zero NBA champions. 
Earlier this week Lebron jumped on Twitter and quickly gained a massive following. 
But I'm starting to wonder if Lebron isn't painting himself into a corner, and has maybe misread how quickly sentiment can change. 
That's one of the reasons Shaq's been a huge hit on Twitter . 
I think an appropriate comparison might be Alex Rodriguez. 
By making his announcement in this public way, Lebron has only heaped more pressure on himself. 
James now finds himself in the following position: 1. 
Not winning a title will be seen as a massive disappointment 3. 
He's put himself in a position where if he leaves Cleveland, every other city (and Cleveland) will be rooting against him Sounds just like Alex Rodriguez, doesn't it? 
Winning championships. 
Let's see what the future holds for Lebron. 
Make sure it's clear that the team comes first and that he's looking forward to being part of the team.

Wednesday, 26 May 2010 The effect of not being on vacation in Italy on a man with a tall stack of papers to grade. 
As evidence of how thoroughly corrupt the region is, I present a picture (courtesy of her) of the cabin she'll be staying in free of charge until July: That's the view she'll be writing her dissertation to the next two months. 
So the only opportunity I have to talk to her (via Skype) is that last hour in the late evening when the loft cools enough to be habitable—provided, of course, that the wifi strength that evening is strong enough to establish and maintain a connection. 
But this post isn't about how melancholy I become when I haven't heard from her by 3 p.m. 
I've written about Urbino before , but because the wife is providing me with such dazzling photographs of the city, I feel compelled to do so again. 
This photograph of the dueling signs for the Hotel Raffaello the wife snapped the other day typifies the way the city feels: You can enter the hotel either through the door with the green awning or the second story window of an adjacent building. 
*If it wasn't, even Homer nods? 
If she is working, she is not on vacation. 
I know this is over kill, but you need to get out of the funk you are in and grade the papers and finish the course so you can get some down time and catch up on your sleep. 
I'm having to live it through my beautiful, vacationing wife. 
United carbon offset disappointment April 27, 2009 9:08 AM I'm a big believer in carbon offsets (not so much the cap and trade game, but in the simple internalize-your-externality-sort). 
We're a couple months late buying credits for last year. 
But to calculate it accurately requires churning through a pile of flights. 
But I want something more accurate. 
It allows you to input total miles flown, but its Mileage Plus page doesn't give you total miles flown, it gives you the total added to your account (included bonuses, etc.) Looking forward to version 2.0. 
April 27, 2009 9:53 AM Padraic: Why aren't you a supporter of cap & trade? 
April 27, 2009 10:20 AM lessig: I favor a mandatory scheme -- internalize your externality. 
It seems like a complicated partial version of that, created by the same genius quants who gave us the mess on wall street, that is designed to generate large fees finance types. 
April 27, 2009 12:07 PM Padraic Ryan: Re: cap & trade - you shouldn't use the financial crisis as an excuse to write off all of economics. 
You're right that a carbon tax is definitely simpler, but there are upsides to cap & trade as well (such as the fact that the market will drive the price up, whereas a tax won't increase unless Congress wants it to). 
My problem with carbon offsets and other voluntary measures is that given the finite amount of money, energy and attention we have to push for the environment, I feel like the opportunity cost of these measures is too high compared to policy-oriented actions, the citizen role that Gore referred. 
I'm a big fan of your work on IP and corruption, but I'm skeptical of these initial ventures into the environmental arena... 
April 27, 2009 2:51 PMCathy: When you book a route on United it tells you how many miles it will accrue, pre-bonus, for each leg. 
You should see this on a screen before you purchase the ticket, and possibly also after. 
So cut and paste into your spreadsheet and it should be fine. 
so you can fill in the real mileage to L.A.

Carbon offsets 'harm environment' http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6378471.stm Tuesday, 20 February 2007, 17:31 GMT Jutta Kill, of the Forests and the European Union Resource Network (FERN), was the most vehement opponent of the practice, arguing it probably did more harm than good. 
In addition, "More than half" of the money given to companies selling carbon offsets went on research and administration costs, "benefiting not the climate but the burgeoning consultancy industry". 
Illusions are powerful around here, it seems. 
May 14, 2009 2:45 PM Jason Sperling: It's nice to see feedback on the United program. 
Currently many companies are reticent to putting something in their purchase path as an upsell, just as they are reticent to putting anything in their purchase path. 
When the type of program you imagine IS put in place, the results have been very good. 
Somewhere in California, a blighted, mosquito-vector abandoned property is about to get an echinacea dose via seedbomb. 
Understand that a job worth doing is worth doing crappily. 
Nothing worth doing was learned perfectly the first time. 
Here's where we started - Gift seeds of California Poppy via Jessica Reeder's mom. 
2. 
Use seeds of any kind, even dumpster-salvaged ones, or the ones that might be too old for the garden. 
Or you could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at that estate sale last year and get to mixing. 
Dust can fly into your mouth and eyes very easily. 
Use gloves to break up the soil with your fingers. 
Make bombs. 
You're going to be throwing them. 
Mine were more or less matzoh-ball size and shape, out of habit. 
Allow to dry overnight, or until they're solid enough for the next step. 
Throw. 
I chose one abandoned property a few minutes from downtown, and two vacant lots. 
I found this hard to do while also avoiding cops, dealing with the camera and the car window, scoping out angles of approach for throwing, etc. 
Also, a perfect strike. 
Second Lesson -- keep the seedbombs in a shallow covered container . 
Plus, those things are crumbly. 
And the last lesson -- have fun . 
No one I know is getting digg'd or favrd yet for throwing color and scent around the ghetto. 
You may want to keep checking on your flowers (I promise I will) or you might get an idea to do something else completely unexpected (I did). 
Earth is my friend, like that old classmate who you keep forgetting to drop a note to on Facebook. 
I did it by throwing flowers all along those places no one goes, but where our planet's future lives. 
Yes, yes, I know, you know of much better places to never throw those seedbombs you haven't made. 
A job worth doing is worth doing crappily.

Noshin' at the Tupelo Honey Cafe | Plus, how to get great service in busy restaurants 23 Mar., 2010 By the time I got to Asheville, I was nearing the end of my journey and the bottom of my wallet. 
But. 
So I checked their website, and instantly fell in love: "Tupelo Honey Café opened in downtown Asheville in 2000, an early pioneer in the farm to fork movement and an active advocate for the independent restaurant landscape that pervades the city. 
Our cuisine salutes our love of Southern traditions at the table, but like the good people of Asheville, marches to its own drum. 
By the time I finally got a seat at the counter, I was starved. 
Free range? 
While I waited for the food, I checked out the back of the store where Tupelo Honey Cafe hawks their homestyle wares: preserves, pickles, salsa, honey, t-shirts, aprons and all sorts of mini-advertisements for the restaurant. 
There's nothing wrong with it: the food in those jars is probably delicious, though I question whether the $10 tupelo honey had to come from Florida or if it's produced locally. 
Some of that is surely due to good marketing, but the real reason for its popularity is this: That sandwich was so good, I found myself eating slower and slower with each bite to savor it more completely. 
I found myself silently thanking the chicken for its delicious contribution. 
I will never forget you. 
I stopped so I could take the rest home and taste it again later. 
If you're going to a busy restaurant and want great service, bring a camera. 
Now, I'm not saying the service before my camera-flash was bad, because it was awesome. 
Which, it just so happens, I am. 
I can't guarantee it'll work, but I personally will do it againand probably back it up with a stellar review, just like the one I've given the Tupelo Honey Cafe. 
Okay, that's it! 
Sep, 2009 This post is the first of a three-part series on bike culture. 
Remember how much fun you used to have on that bike, how fast you went, how great it felt? 
And there are no two ways about it: if you give a kid a bike, that kid will ride. 
He's somewhat of a man brain trust , and one of his best creations is the Troy Bike Rescue . 
When Andrew decided to leave town for a few years' schooling in NYC, friends and cohorts took over operations. 
They get it. 
More than a toy, it's an equalizer that allows poor kids to ride with rich. 
When I visited the TBR shop, it was packed with frames, wheels, gears, chains, handlebars, kids, and anarchist art (the space is being donated by some supporters who are also anti-capitalist activists). 
The idea is to give people a workspace and teach them how to maintain their own bicycle. 
A young kid came in to say his last bike was stolen and he needed a new one (and, despite Andrew's stern reprimand that he couldn't just walk in every week and leave with a free bike, he did just that). 
And as we left at the end of the workshop, a woman walked up to Andrew. 
"I have a whole bunch of bikes to give you." See, ultimately TBR is about more than just bicycles. 
This is not the world's first bike collective; in fact it's only one of many that have stealthily sprung up around America. 
You too can change the world: all you have to do is ride a bike. 
It doesn't have to be perfect, just good enough to get you places. 
Then keep going! 
Ride it to the corner store when you need milk, instead of driving across town to the grocery store. 
Tell the store owner what you like, and see if he'll carry it. 
It doesn't have to be a workout: you can just toodle around town and look at stuff. 
Unless you live on a major highway, odds are you can ride straight from your front porch to someplace interesting. 
It's cheaper, and much better for the local flora&fauna. 
Then think of it this way: by riding your bike instead of driving your car, you're reducing your consumption of fossil fuels. 
Can't find a bike community?

Bike rescue is not just for kids.

With his long hair, scruffy beard and t-shirt, he'd fit in more at a Phish show than behind a plow. 
To wit: in 2009, David helped launch the Truro Ag Fair -- an event that exceeded all expectations and brought huge crowds to local farmers' booths. 
And he manages the First Light Organic Farm, a lush green spot in a hollow of North Truro. 
David's a dedicated and inspired agrarian, whose passion for farming keeps him optimistic. 
The hard truth: The soil of North Truro is not strong enough to support agriculture. 
David points out a patch of sand with a thin strip of fertile loam along the edge. 
"This is what happens," David says. 
Last year's rich loam is now useless sand. 
The Outer Cape is really just a spit of sand -- but still, farmers lived here for generations. 
Salt marsh hay. 
This was called "salt marsh haying". 
This makes it an excellent and bountiful source of compost, and it was used for generations as a soil enricher. 
All the nutrients get depleted." That means soil left for two months without fresh compost will become -- you guessed it -- sand. 
That means truckloads of hay, and that means a lot of work. 
It worked -- but it cost money, and it disappeared fast into the hungry ground. 
In bygone times, the whole town of North Truro would pitch in on haying days; now, David's on his own. 
Provincetown's official population of 3,500 supports a tourism industry that serves millions of visitors each year. 
And then they go out to eat. 
Raina Stefani serves David's produce at her restaurant Terra Luna , but it only makes up a portion of her fares: the rest has to be shipped from the mainland. 
End of story. 
David isn't alone: he's got the support (and companionship) of a growing group of gamechangers. 
The same population that would consume the food produced here is actively inhibiting its production. 
After all, what's the point of farming on the beach? 
Sep, 2010 at 7:52 am If, someone could start bedding the outer cape's horses, with this Hay/Straw. 
They wouldn't have to be standing on the acidic sand all of the time. 
The straw, should be separated from the manure and dried in the air, then buised, by hooves. 
How soon is now? 
But bubbling below the surface was Blade and other genre flicks, then Twilight hit and now vampires are hot. 
Ninja Warrior is one of the most popular shows on G4. 
No, actually, if we've learned anything it's that genre memes just go back underground ( Pirates for adults [NSFW]You get the point0. 
So it's not just a matter of knowing when to jump off the Vampire merry-go-round, it's knowing when (and where) to jump back on. 
Fourteen literary agents rejected it before Stephenie Meyer got a deal. 
I don't think you can "get off" any of these, you have to triangulate your decision across several nodes of popular culture, a triangulation that has to revolve around the audience (young adult -- Twilght. 
So what sort of matrix board do you have to create to know that a NC-17 comedy horror Zombie video game will work, but a PG-13 young adult time-travelling Vampire TV show won't? 
All you can do is hope you bat .300 and that when you fail, you fail fast . 
If you broaden your scope a bit, I think it would be difficult to find a time over the last 40 years or so when any of these four archetypes didn't have a level of bubbling popularity via books, comic books, tv, movies, video games, music. 
Somebody at AMC is greenlighting The Walking Dead based partly on historical evidence that says people like Zombies, but also partly on the notion that this particular iteration will have a new twist that will bring new people into the (zombie and AMC) tent .

"In recession, face brutal facts, thrive" By Jim Collins A man in his early 20s recently asked me, "So what's a recession like?" Its an entirely alien concept to him; he'd grown up during the greatest economic boom in modern memory. 
Adm. 
military officer in the Hanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War. 
He shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda. 
After his release, Stockdale became the first three-star officer in the history of the Navy to wear both aviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
In preparation, I read In Love and War, the book he and his wife wrote to chronicle their experiences those 8 years. 
It just seemed so bleak - the uncertainty of his fate, the brutality of his captors. 
I'm getting depressed reading this, and I know that he gets out, reunites with his family and becomes a national hero. 
Finally, I asked, "Who didn't make it out?" "Oh, that's easy," he said. 
I don't understand," I said, completely confused. 
Oh, they were the ones who said, 'We're going to be out by Christmas.' And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go. 
And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas again. 
You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end - which you can never afford to lose - with the need for discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be." My conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me, but I never really considered it a business lesson until my research team began to wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to become great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties weakened and dispirited. 
Fannie Mae, for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing $1M every business day, with $56B in loans under water. 
But CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not merely survive, but also to prevail as a great company. 
But they used this grim fact as a catalyst for creating an entirely new business model based on asking three central questions of greatness: What can we potentially do better than any other company in the world? 
What best ignites the passions of our people? 
Eventually, it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the general stock market. 
Their companies will begin to die of a broken heart. 
Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox - those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail in the end, but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of reality - will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce greatness.

This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. 
In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad. 
He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. 
Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce. 
I gave these materials to Sudaker today.

Brulte Greetings All: First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email. 
Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f or delivery to Sen. 
As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to "wallpaper" Sacramento wi th our proposed legislation. 
Mike sent the "final" version s of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today. 
I'm assuming that you folks will handle that end of things. 
This email does, however, include a "summary" of our proposed legislation. 
I think we all agreed that we need a "one pager" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively. 
We didn't finalize that plan. 
Perhaps we could start with our friends in the Direct Access coalition? 
Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function. 
Thanks to all for helping pull this together. 
There's a hard copy on your chair. 
I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to AB1X. 
Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California. 
We will deliver to your office tomorrow detailed legislative language. 
I hope that the information is useful.

Utility stand-by charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract monopoly prices from customers, or both. 
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investor-owned and municipal utilities Solution: The Governor,s executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right direction*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within 7 days. 
In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations. 
This could be accomplished through amendments to SB 27X. 
Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale, "distributed generation" facil ities. 
The State should ensure that local, parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects .

We understand that the lion,s share of counterparties share Enron,s c redit risk concerns. 
As such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover DWR,s costs of power purchases. 
Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers. 
Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power. 
We have identified three options: Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the PUC would accept as "prudent and reasonable" all purchase costs incur red by DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases. 
We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option. 
Those options include a letter of credit, cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral. 
Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are likely. 
Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o date. 
California's very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement. 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest. 
The CEC paints a considerably more optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand. 
We wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals. 
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year. 
The Governor's executive orders and Senator Sher's siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction. 
Enron's proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2) transfering credits between air districts. 
California could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g., through the summer months). 
Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements: An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price for hour-ahead power in real time. 
We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW. 
We recommend that the State of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation. 
Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from customers and businesses. 
Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o f Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration. 
Procureme nt is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves. 
To execute the transition, California should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load. 
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California's supply-demand imbalance. 
Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to participate in that market. 
California should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without "shocking" the economy or household budgets For example, California could amortize the recovery of the utilities, past debt over a 5-10 year period. 
Second, California can "net" the revenues the utilities have r eceived from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e accrued due to the retail price cap.

Subject: RE: City of Pasadena If I can get all of the information today, I can tell you this afternoon. 
I have sent Patti a list. 
So, if I know today, I can pay on Friday. 
I'm not sure what the feature in question is, but if it's something which lets users specify the value to be sent out as the MIME Content-Type: charset, I think it's a bad idea, and should be removed or significantly altered. 
I find that the best way to think about charset is that it is *neither*. 
(You'll notice that I reinforce this distinction in my own head and in this message by using the terms "character set" and "charset" noninterchangeably.) The charset situation is much like the canonical CRLF situation: the fact that the canonical representation is identical to some but not all of the available local representations guarantees misunderstandings. 
However, just letting users specify non-default, non-7-bit-US-ASCII, (non-MIME) charsets is an open invitation to misunderstanding and noninteroperability. 
I've copied this message to the IETF character sets mailing list (ietf-charsets@innosoft.com, subscription requests to ietf-charsets-request@innosoft.com); any followup traffic should be sent there, and *not* to the ietf-822 list.

In defense of the other Pine team members, the sin is one of omission rather than of comission; they wanted to do something about character sets and didn't want to wire in a table of legal values (since it might change). 
More work would definitely be needed in this area, but you'll appreciate that there are other, higher priorities just now... 
For example if you set Pine to use ISO-8859-1 and send an all ASCII message it will tag it US-ASCII (instead of ISO-8859-1). 
Thought that was what required for minimal MIME compliance.

So, perhaps Pine could have US-ASCII, ISO-2022-JP, and the various ISO-8859-x sets wired in as an initial list, and the system file specify additional valid sets? 
What do you think? 
We can probably adjust the comment in the .pinerc for now. 
It just hasn't been done because limited resources. 
> What do you think? 
>This is almost certainly a bad idea, ... 
Specifically, I feel (quite strongly) that the user should be able to specify any old charset and have display at least attempted at the other end. 
No. 
This is because there are such things as gateways which translate the SMTP octet-stream into anything. 
For the former, use Base64 encoding when needed. 
I don't think this is making sense and I can't find the words. 
(memory is cheap) On VM/CMS, plain text is EBCDIC (now CodePage 1047) and records are handled by the filesystem out-of-band of the data, so NL (and LF and CR) aren't sacred characters. 
"mail is plain-text, not ASCII". 
Right! 
> (You'll notice that I reinforce this distinction in my >own head and in this message by using the terms "character set" >and "charset" noninterchangeably.) Thanks. 
And this thinking, carried into MIME (thus this should be kicked BACK TO the IETF-822 list, but I refrain), shows up in the use of CHARSET=ISO-8859-1 rather than CHARACTER_SET=Latin-1. 
(and yes, sad but true, any SMTPs will strip the high bit) >To be sure, automated selection of and translation to a registered >MIME charset is a non-trivial task, ... 
Which is why I want routers, gateways, and all MTAs (mail transfer agents) to stay out of it. 
Just leave it alone and let it default at the receiving end. 
And let me reiterate that I'm not mad at the Pine developers (nor the MIME developers; not mad at anyone, just trying to push a point that I think is important and has been missed). 
Thanks for making up and using those labels! 
But, could you please discuss on pine specific features in pine ML only? 
>On UNIX, plain text is ASCII (now ISO-8859-1) with lines delimited by >NL (actually LF). 
>That ain't ASCII, though we could be the high-order 8 bits for much >of plain text processing, and that's fine by me. 
Please, gentlemen.....read the RFC.

Regards, Borka ================== Erik and IESG members, I believe that the revised charter defines most of the issues and defines them well. 
However, our criteria for this BOF should be that it helps illuminate and define the problem and advances the understanding needed to define WGs, and I think it is more likely to do that than anything else we are likely to come up with. 
We are in the process of building global directory systems and other information services on the global Internet. 
This means that the Directory must be able to handle national characters not found in the US-ASCII repetoire. 
This is especially a problem as information services are provided for clients on various difference hardware architectures. 
(See RFC1345 for further information on these character sets.) If we consider the other scripts used in Europe and the other encodings the number of different charater set codes rise to as many as 40. 
Changing the character sets in this world is not an option, as current systems run applications which can support only the character sets used by that system. 
(2) Should a general-purpose SW tool be designed that will support both UCS and regional character sets? 
an API) without specifying the actual underlying implementation? 
Can we discuss the missing agreement/specifiactions required in the communication protocols such as: (5.1) The order of octets in the interchange of data is left to be specified by the sender and the recipient in UCS. 
Can we define a mechanism to identify the serialized byte order of a data stream? 
Do these schemes have any merit? 
(5.4) Do we need to differentiate or specify how tagged data (i.e the field typ e in a data base)and how "serialized byte order" data are treated in a communication protocol or will some common specification for the tag and the type be sufficient? 
If possible a clear set of issues could be identified then WG(s) will be defined. 
Thanks for getting this together.

I have learned with much interest that people envision solutions for international characters data exchange with a wider point of view than usually heard in the networking sphere. 
I thought I could contribute with a small text explaining the way I have finally come to think of the problem. 
The text may sound theoretical at first. 
The ideas are based on experience. 
I participated to the design of Kermit multinational 8-bit characters support and the TCP/IP network I work for is well on the way towards the the same theory that every character on the communication line is ISO 8859-1. 
Every piece working towards a common well defined goal finally pays more when all parts start to clutch than wandering for immediate interest. 
Character data caused little problem because ASCII was assumed, full stop. 
It was tacit computer culture. 
Any computer has to exchange more than ASCII. 
With much respect for their work, this is not (no longer) the way to do it. 
Let us count the different character codes (IBM have their share) and protocols, the bill is amazing! 
(Meaning that common tools be available to translate present local code). 
What computer Si has to do to abide by the external representation is the sole matter of computer Si: to appear to others as if it were using it internally. 
No tagging of the data nor any need to know any character code other than one's own and the interchange code. 
This is the extended "ASCII culture" of some future, no doubt. 
It is a fact that the choice of a character code has long lasting effects, because of the building software base. 
The sooner the better. 
More theoretically said this time, this local-code to exchange-code translation works much a la OSI layer (or "a` la", if you don't mind :-) Data is encoded towards a lower layer, exchanged, and decoded back to same level, but possibly to a different local code. 
But that's not sure, like for XDR which can be used from many levels to convert CPU data to line format. 
What seems clear in my mind is that the translation is not in several final protocols, but a protocol by itself -- like XDR -- that other protocols refer to. 
It is a pity to see each protocol tackle the problem its own way. 
Think of the line separator problem of NFS for the basic case of text files. 
One cannot increase complication eternally. 
The important thing is that the new layer be known and used. 
Will ISO 10646 be used by OSI 6?

If Microsoft released a unilateral draft, to whom did you release it? 
Most of all, if the working group is still working on an "actual spec," what purpose is served by this unilateral STLP document? 
The rest of the industry needs to have confidence in this process. 
At that meeting, Microsoft precented our STLP strawman document. 
Our goal was to deal with the differences Microsoft and Netscape quickly so that the normal IETF process would move forward without any detractions from either Microsoft or Netscape.

Ralph Youngen, Associate Director, Electronic Product Development for AMS has accepted the invitation to join the group, along with a couple of his colleagues. 
We discussed whether it was necessary to use SGML for the math notation. 
This can be included in HTML documents and handled correctly by SGML processing applications via the NOTATION mechanism. 
Niel said this wasn't as simple as at first it might appear. 
It is also unclear as to when macro processing is applied. 
It should be practical for parsers to deal with missing arguments sensibly. 
Raman voiced a concern on Bruce's comment on 2D pictures. 
Raman promised to propose some new wording. 
We ended by discussing some of the parsing issues for mismatched brackets and number literals. 
Authors should be able to control the settings for this and for literals.

Here are some comments. 
2. 
Between =-=-=-= lines I'll include a piece I wrote about that in relation to the Elsevier Science DTD's. 
Earlier summary of the problem ------------------------------ A generic mechanism for counters, including some rules for presentation of counters, is as follows. 
- All top-level counters start at the value 0 (zero) at the beginning of the document. 
This label is e.g. 
- The values of the |id| attributes are unique within the document instance. 
- If the |id| attribute is missing, the counter is not incremented, and the element is not numbered. 
(Or are there also cases where tables and figures are not numbered?) There are (at least) the following exceptions to the algorithm described above: 1. 
Normal equation numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) is interrupted by an equation number that is `derived from' an earlier one. 
3. 
Example: a numbered list with items 1, 2, 3, is followed by a paragraph of text (the || is on the same level as the |<l>|), and then the list continues 4, 5, 6. 
A similar example can be found in equation sub-numbering: equations (4a) and (4b) are followed by a paragraph of text, followed by equations (4c) and (4d). 
Hidden sub-figures ------------------ When a figure (as far as we know, hidden sub-components occur only with figures.) that exists as one physical entity consists of logical sub-entities, the only solution lies in adding this information, which lies *outside* the document, to the document. 
This enables generation of the labels of the sub-figures. 
Second an example of hidden sub-figures: <fig id=fig4> <figlnk file="fig4"> </fig> the picture in |fig4| contains two labels, `a' and `b', that identify sub-figures. 
If we add an attribute to the start tag we can achieve this: |<fig id=fig4 comp="a b"^gt;|. 
Unfortunately, the attribute |comp="a b"| also suggests a presentation. 
Derived equation numbers ------------------------ We illustrate this case with an example. 
In that case we have the following (id, label) pairs for the first three equations: (eq1, 1) (eq2, 2) (eq3, 3) The next equation should have an (id, label) pair like this: (eq$1, label(eq1)') where |eq$1| is the unique |id| assigned to equation~(1'), and |label(eq1)| stands for the label of the equation with id=eq1. 
Interrupted sequences --------------------- This case occurs with list items within a numbered list, or with numbered sub-equations. 
This could be achieved if we also numbered the parent element \verb|<l^gt;|.) Suppose we have <l> <li id="liA">a footnote is ... 
<li id="liD">a table is ... 
We agreed earlier that one of the guiding principles is to follow the author unless there are errors in the manuscript.

For instance if one uses an SGML named character entity how does the tokenizer know whether the character is allowed as part of an identifier? 
o If it is an operator, its types (prefix/infix/postfix) and the associated left and right precedences. 
Action: Bruce to add a detailed schema for the character dictionary. 
Bruce said he wanted to avoid potential naming conflicts with other groups wishing to define new HTML tags. 
Bruce will work on this. 
Neil explained that this makes it much easier to write the line breaking algorithm. 
In the short term, this will remain a problem. 
We discussed what HTML tags might be appropriate within HTML-math. 
A the minimum we probably need: o plain text o simple kinds of emphasis (bold/italic) o control over font size o hypertext links o line numbering We could further allow this text to include math elements so that we get math including text including math etc. 
The current plug-in api's are inadequate. 
The control panel for the html-math plug-in would allow the user to set the font size to be used in these contexts. 
One idea is to allow the author to name a subexpression and then to use that name in place of further occurrences of that subexpression. 
The scope for such definitions shouldn't be resticted to a single math element. 
Bruce talked through the case where names for subexpressions are generated automatically at browse-time. 
In a previous discussion Raman pointed out that it would be helpful if the user is allowed to set the name of subexpressions as this makes it easier to remember (important for speech-base browsers). 
superscripts, accents etc needs to happen *before* the operator >precedence parsing step. 
Mathematica's parsing, which works in a manner similar to what Bruce describes, has no problem handling complex embellishments as in your example. 
Do you have a (simple) example in mind where it fails? 
V. 
In AsTeR, you could name a cross-referencable object such as an equation with meaningful names e.g. 
I refered to this in AsTeR as "variable substitution". 
"lower constraint 1" and denominator 3" etc. 
However, even without the intelligence to recognize two semantically equivalent instances of a subexpression, "variable substitution" or "folding" as Dave refers to it in his minutes is *really* useful for speech and I suspect it would be very useful for small visual displays.

I can see value in allowing prefix and postfix operators to act as operator embellishments, for instance to add accents to operators or to change their relative size, or position. 
Am I missing something? 
Some more comments: I agree with Ron Whitney, and should have said so before, that the effort that has gone into this proposal is substantial, and this is really concrete stuff we can "chew on". 
While reading the discussion between Bruce Smith and Ron Whitney, I have come to the conclusion that the plug-in solution will not work, because we need the possibility of anchor's within math, and math in text in math.

My own perceptions of this committee's work to date follow. 
Insofar as the work of the ISO 12083 Math Committee stopped short of recommending ways to handle "semantic" aspects of math markup, recognizing that the issues were many and difficult, the work of this committee in that regard feels to me a welcome addition to the overall discussion of those sorts of problems. 
This effort, in some sense competing with Roy Pike's, seems very healthy to me. 
The Wolfram proposal certainly acknowledges the need to accommodate SGML entities and supports and SGML style of markup. 
I was hoping, and still do, that formal support such as this would give a direct means of filtering ISO 12083 math into HTML-math. 
And then there may be the feeling that WRI is pushing a standard of its own. 
This is a quiet statement, not a defensive one. 
I asked the question because I wanted to know how feasible the mechanisms are that Bruce describes. 
I said "he consented", but I should have said "he consented grudgingly and certainly not wholeheartedly".

You can however make anchors within plugins work. 
This is enough to allow anchor's within math, and math in text in math, with the burden placed on the plugin.

Am I missing something? 
The arguments are technical, so people who don't care can stop reading. 
The most reasonable "error correction" would be to have the '_' embellishe '+'. 
When the parser sees the '+', it sees that it must be a prefix operator, and so will shift the '2' on. 
Since the details of why a prefix embellishing operator sometimes "works" right and sometimes doesn't are probably beyond most authors, I think we should avoid them.

I am unconvinced by your examples.

You have already asserted that people are comfortable with dictionary definitions for the roles of symbols as prefix, infix or postfix operators (including their precedences). 
Can you give me examples that would be hard to explain to a user? 
Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award. 
Dear David Hardy, It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary. 
Moore's are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced, partially through well funded public relations campaigns, partially through conservative "grass-roots" propaganda. 
All in all, it is an accurate portrayal of America's gun and violence culture. 
On your webpage, you state that "Moore's resolution is questionable. 
There is a huge difference, for example, between playing a game like "Quake" and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now. 
Similarly, the main motivation for the crusades (beyond the promise of wealth) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved. 
Interactive fiction like video games, on the other hand, presents violence in a narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven. 
This is consistent with the kind of media-incited violence described above, and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence. 
Moore's second hypothesis is that America's foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts, a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists. 
In a weaker sense, the same message is projected to American children, who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another, but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how "the enemies of freedom" are punished. 
Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show: "They squealed like little piggies too, so you'll have to make do with 'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll' for their last words. 
Still think fucking with the U.S. 
Inaccuracies Your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moore's movies. 
It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades. 
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, linked from your site, an employee claims that the gun would have been "normally" picked up at another dealer. 
This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore. 
According to the same WSJ interview, "Typically, you're looking at a week to 10 days waiting period." This is plausible -- but entirely irrelevant for the movie, which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed. 
There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene. 
The silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation: a bank handing out guns to its customers, higlighting the utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious. 
This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often, and it also the most inaccurate. 
The dialogue goes as follows: Moore: "So you don't think our kids say to themselves, gee, dad goes off to the factory every day - he builds missiles. 
What's the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School?" McCollum (PR person): "I guess I don't see that specific connection because the missiles that you're talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us." First, note the word "our" in Moore's question. 
McCollum understands it this way -- otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized. 
Even Lockheed did not believe the public to be that gullible. 
As Moore correctly points out, it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons, but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence -- children learn by imitating adults. 
It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes, shown on national TV even here in Germany. 
Nowhere does Moore say or imply that these words were uttered at the rally in Denver, and in fact, their reptition later in the movie at another occasion (oddly claimed by critics to be again "misattributed") is simply a reminder of this. 
The "visual of a billboard and a narration" is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver. 
This is a common technique, but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking, they believe critics who claim that he is "distorting" the interview. 
The NRA was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so. 
You claim that there was "no way to change location, since you have to give advance notice of that to the members, and there were upwards of 4,000,000 members." 10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date, had the NRA really wanted to. 
That does not change the fact that they did just that. 
This is what good documentary filmmaking is about. 
Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!). 
To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics. 
Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion: "Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas. 
Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else? 
Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland, you write: "There is no indication that [Heston] recognized Kayla Rolland's case." This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence. 
Regarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase "48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead": This is one valid criticism, but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be; rather, it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore's fast pace editing. 
Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression. 
However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons: a) Moore clearly states that "before he came to Flint", Heston gave an interview. 
If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published? 
I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing. 
The camera lingers on Bush/Cheney posters, and the protestor is quoted as saying that "we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland". 
Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of "Bowling" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston. 
The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly. 
In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is "full of lies". 
You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology, yet you have no problems changing it yourself. 
After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland (again, clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA's presence), then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of the film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to the immediate reactions of "people from all over America", gun owners/groups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating. 
This is all not mentioned by critics of Moore's movie, who claim to be objective. 
From this, you construct an obscure conspiracy of "re-enactment": "For all we can tell, Moore could have shouted 'Hey!' to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left." Even if your "re-enactment" theory is true (and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion), this itself is not unethical, and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here, just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview. 
6)Animated history of the US. 
But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote "gun rights" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish. 
This is the key message of this part of the animation, which is again being ignored by its critics. 
You write: "Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before". 
It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset. 
But why do people deal with drugs? 
It is by now well documented that the CIA tolerated crack sales in US cities to fund the operation of South American "contras" It is equally well known that the so-called "war on drugs" begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population (both in relative and absolute numbers). 
Once again, your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms Moore's (and Busch's) assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes. 
Poverty is frequently portrayed as natural, and the poor in America are seen by conservatives as VCR-owners who are just too lazy to work. 
It is notable that the Wall Street Journal's reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours: It called Moore's claim "preposterous". 
8) Taliban and American aid. 
Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001. 
Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage. 
Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal. 
9) Gun homicides. 
That's because they know all too well that Moore is correct: The United States have a far greater homicide rate (both gun- and non-gun) than most other first world countries. 
A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite.com website. 
The gun control movement, on the other hand, distracts from the real causes of violence -- poverty, paranoia, the "war on drugs" and antisexuality. 
10) Canada ammunition purchase. 
He asks us to "look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at a local Canadian Wal-Mart." He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised. 
I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted, in Canada. 
Once again, you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and "faking" (a word which "Canadian officials" have never used; for such a distortion, Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics). 
He made no claims whatsoever in the film about the need to show or not show identification. 
11) Heston's allegedly implied racism. 
If anything, it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with "having a more mixed ethnicity". 
Your accusations of inappropriate cutting are once again entirely unsupported -- in fact, it is quite clear from watching that particular scene that there is not a single cut from the point at which Moore asks Heston a second time for the cause of the higher violence in the States, and the point when he mentions the Kayla Rolland incident. 
Conclusion You write: "Bowling for Columbine is dishonest. 
It is not a flawless diamond -- the "48 hours" scene in particular suffers from bad editing, the statistics are suboptimal, and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves. 
Certainly, Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today, and his film fully deserved its Oscar. 
It is not only the highest grossing non-music documentary of all time, among the users of the largest Internet film database, IMDB, it is also the highest rated one. 
But perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason. 
It is unlikely, however, that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact.

Tavárez Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others. 
Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices. 
The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry. 
Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key. 
In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia. 
Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system, in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land. 
In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). 
The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century. 
This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. 
In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed, 200,000 Mayans were killed, and over 1 million more were displaced. 
Central to these was the question of indigenous identity: largely lost amidst the overwhelming Spanish influence, local leaders sought to rediscover their native roots and redefine what it meant to be a part of indigenous culture. 
The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181). 
This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior. 
By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority. 
Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85). 
It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84). 
Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty. 
They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52). 
The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58). 
Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158). 
However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172). 
Nonetheless, in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages, which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language, recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion. 
This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia. 
In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves. 
Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture. 
It is necessary to work within the national legal system in order to gain policy reform beyond the local level; however, with widely differing concepts of justice a a balance is difficult to achieve. 
When a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out, the group feels the effects as a whole. 
(Rappaport 2005) Once punishments are completed, the criminal is seen as rehabilitated, having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order, and is welcomed back into the community (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 61, Rappaport 2005: 97). 
The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms, as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution, but to recapture its spirit in a native, rather than Western discourse (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58-59). 
Translation fulfills another vital role, as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself. 
The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature; Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten (Rappaport 2005: 165). 
Difficulties arise, however, as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop. 
The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great, leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought. 
Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya; thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique Mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions, which most often occurs under Spanish influence. 
The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85). 
There develops a duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom. 
This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed. 
In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not (Jackson 1995: 8). 
Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the ever-persist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment.

Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot: Colony Infiltration and Task Switching Sonia Roberts 11/27/07 Introduction Background Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years. 
No robot has yet been constructed, however, that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus; nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them. 
I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot (hereafter referred to as Antie) that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest, switching between the foraging, patrolling and midden work behaviors. 
The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds, many of which do not grow in the desert (Gordon, 54), where only a few varieties of small shrubs, small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow (Gordon, 51). 
Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests, intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive (Gordon, 11). 
Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil. 
Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal, as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season, which occurs but once per year. 
Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest. 
Patrolling and foraging, too, occur for the most part outside of the nest, and have therefore been studied extensively (ex., Schafer, et al, 2006; Gordon, et al, 2002; Gordon, 2002; Gordon, 1987). 
Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling. 
This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998). 
Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks (as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task), walk, navigate both within and outside of the nest, and of course switch tasks at appropriate times. 
Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C, for which some pseudocode is included. 
Antie be a circular robot, no more than 1cm in diameter (the length of a red harvester ant), with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization. 
Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging. 
Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance. 
A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached. 
The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function. 
Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius (Gordon, 9), and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in-nest navigation. 
The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation, and the bump sensors will, when depressed, also initiate the escape function. 
The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and -45 degrees from the center front of Antie, respectively, that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern. 
This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest, given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos, et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning. 
2. 
Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae, and to mimic this, Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting “stalks” with which to both interact with other ants (who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae) and take in chemical information. 
Antie’s stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves, which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate (Arnold, et al, 1996, as cited in Gordon & Mehdiabadi, 1999), receptors to detect food, and receptors for three types of pheromones: those released by successful foragers returning with food, those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest, and those marking piles of trash as midden. 
Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns (Gordon, 2002), and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest (Gordon & Greene, 2003; Greene & Gordon, 2007). 
For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone. 
This technique, described by Ishida, et al (2001), has been shown to improve the chemical plume-tracking abilities of robots. 
Finally, Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object. 
These will correspond to the muscles of the ant’s mandibles, which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects. 
Fig 3. 
Sensor Relation to Ant Placement on Antie Function Sonar detectors Eyes; object perception Skirt Prevent object collisions! 
There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs. 
A third motor will lift and lower the grippers, allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head. 
These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt. 
Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section. 
Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible, and where appropriate, different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked. 
To ease Antie’s on-board memory requirements and processing capabilities (and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand), I propose a few global variables and subroutines. 
Assume a function to determine more precise // location, returning these variables: double left_midden_IP; double right_midden_IP; // Array inputs from left and right alkene sensors. 
Assume a function to determine location: double left_sucfor_IP; double right_sucfor_IP; // Array inputs from left and right “successful patroller” // sensors. 
Assume a function to determine location: double left_hydrocarb_IP; double right_hydrocarb_IP; // Array inputs from left and right chemical seed detectors. 
boolean midden_detect = false; // is an object midden? 
boolean sucfor_detect = false; // successful forager boolean forager_detect = false; // forager boolean midworker_detect = false; // midden worker poolean patroller_detect = false; // patroller boolean sucpat_detect = false; // successful patroller // thresholds at which inputs may be declared to // have been detected double food_threshold; double midden_threshold; double hydrocarb_threshold; // nestmate hydrocarbons boolean forage_active = false; // activation status as forager Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism, procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside, in-nest navigation, an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into, object identification and gripping, a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following, and the identification of other ants. 
// Forward cruise // Takes in a number representing the desired speed. 
// Speeds assumed to be on a 1-10 scale (10 being fastest). 
// The robot will receive the “GO” command as long as // this function is running. 
// Rotate // Takes in a desired angle to rotate the robot and // rotates accordingly // Assume that 10s is sufficient to rotate the robot // completely around one wheel; this may be changed // in implementation. 
In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside, Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading, and also how far from the nest it is at its current location. 
return degrees; } // end nestOrient The second function, which would return the distance in centimeters, might look something like this: // Nest Distance // Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs // and returns the current distance to the nest. 
return dist; } // end nestDist In-nest navigation will be a function of the temperature, read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source. 
The code may look something like this: // Exit Nest // Uses temperature gradient to navigate towards the nest // entrance from inside void nestExit() { // Reads temperature, scoots forward 1s, reads temperature // again, takes the difference, and determines whether current // heading is increasing temperature reading. 
while(photo_IP < sunrise) { double temp = temp_IP; while([timer] < 1){ forCruz(5); } temp -= temp_IP; if(temp>0) rotate(45); } // end nestExit To enter the nest, such as at the end of a task, Antie will perform the same function, except it will seek a lower temperature instead of a higher temperature, it will avoid light, and it will only activate while Antie is less than 10cm from the nest entrance. 
To avoid bumping into things (including other ants), Antie be provided with an escape function. 
Regardless, this will be a very simple function. 
// Sonar sensors are globally declared. 
rotate(45); } } // end escape Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds. 
This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated. 
Objects will include midden and food. 
// Check inputs to determine which smell is strongest // if food smell is detected at higher rate and // above the food threshold for detection, Antie // assumes object is food while (bump_front || (sonar_left_IP && sonar_right_IP)) { if(((left_midden_IP + right_midden_IP) < ((left_food_IP + right_food_IP)) && ((left_food_IP + right_food_IP) > food_threshold) { food_detect = true; } // if midden smell is detected at higher rate // and above threshold for midden detection, // Antie assumes object is midden else if(((left_midden_IP + right_midden_IP) > ((left_food_IP + right_food_IP)) && ((left_midden_IP + right_midden_IP) > midden_threshold) { midden_detect = true; } } // end objID Once the object has been identified, Antie may grip it and lift it. 
Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on “antennae” stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past (Webb, 1998), regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones. 
Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis: // Follow Gradient // Follows a generic chemical gradient, seeking a higher // concentration. 
if (left_IP > right_IP) { [schema] { rotate(-90); forCruz(5); } // end schema } // end if if (right_IP > left_IP) { [schema] { rotate(90); forCruz(5); } // end schema } // end if else forCruz(5); } // end gradientFollow For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode, I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow(), findFood(), and findMidden(). 
The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants. 
As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non-nestmates, Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest. 
The difference in ratio is caused by the time ants spend outside in the sun, which depletes their n-alkene levels. 
The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this: // Ant Identification // Identifies an ant that has snuck up on the // unsuspecting robot. 
(Is this a nestmate?) if((left_hydrocarb_IP + right_hydrocarb_IP) > hydrocarb_threshold) { nestmate_detect = true; // In what task is the nestmate engaged? 
Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony (Gordon, 1996). 
The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior. 
As previously stated, a midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to the surface, depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden. 
If // they are midden, grip and carry outside nest. 
Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest. 
Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005). 
In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34). 
The code may look something like this: // Explore // Takes in desired distance from nest to explore // in cm and moves in a slightly randomized zigzag // pattern void explore(int distance, int time) { // Local Variables int time=0; // integer representing the time to // wander one direction int angle=0; // integer representing number of // degrees to rotate int dir=0; // integer representing the direction to // turn (0=right, 1=left) // Random number generator to add a bit of wanderlust RandomGenerator rGen = new RandomGenerator(); // While loop; robot will keep zigging and zagging // for a set amount of time while ([timer] < time) { if (ant's distance from nest < distance) { // int time gets a random number of seconds // between 3 and 10 time = rGen.nextInt(3,10); // int angle gets a random number of degrees // between 15 and 75 angle = rGen.nextInt(15,75); // function call to rotation subroutine // if dir is 0, rotate to the right; if dir // is 1, rotate to the left. 
if (ant's distance from nest == distance - some small constant) { rotate(135); } // end if // Avoid leaving nest territory else if (nestmate pheromones IP < very low threshold) { while([short timer]) { forCruz(5); // explore a bit further } // end while rotate(45); } // end if } // end if (distance from nest < distance) } // end explore Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again. 
A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food. 
void nestPatrol() { while (photo_IP > [light at sunrise] && temp_IP < 52 degrees Celsius ) { nestExit(); // Nest mounds are generally up to 1m across // Thus, explore in a 50cm radius (Gordon, 6) explore(50, 120); [schema] { rotate(nestOrient()); forCruz(5); nestEnter(); } wait a short time } // end if } // end nestPatrol // Trail Patrolling // Patrollers exit nest and attempt to find food. 
void trailPatrol() { while (photo_IP > [light at sunrise] && temp_IP < 52 degrees Celsius ) { nestExit(); // Explore no further than about 15m from nest, for no // more than 20 minutes if (food_IP > some low threshold){ findFood(); if (food_detect) { [schema] { rotate(nestOrient()); forCruz(5); spray “successful patroller” pheromone nestEnter(); } wait a short time } } else { explore(1500, 20 * 60); [schema] { rotate(nestOrient()); forCruz(5); nestEnter(); } wait a short time } } // end if } // end trailPatrol For the task-switching in the patrolling behavior, assume some variable “age” that Antie has been keeping track of using the CPU’s clock pulses to track the time since its last bootup. 
// PATROLLING // Task-switching hierarchy for the two types of patrolling void patrol() { while (age > nestpatrol_age && age < trailpatrol_age) { nestPatrol(); } while (age > trailpatrol_age && age < forage_age) { trailPatrol(); } } The final behavior, foraging, will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R. 
It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise. 
To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon. 
Boolean forage_today represents Antie’s // activation status for each day once it has switched to // the foraging behavior. 
// When end of plume is reached, retrieve food. 
Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work. 
Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate. 
model of forager activation, every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, a fraction (modeled at 0.0035) of inactive foragers joins the queue. 
The code to model this task-switching might look something like this: ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // TASK-SWITCHING ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // // Main function of Antie’s software. 
This would correspond to the change in // gene expression described by Gordon (2002). 
if (sucfor_detect at time n-1 == false && sucfor_detect at time n == 1) { 0.0035 probability: forage_active = true; } while (age > forage_age && forage_active) { forage(); } } // end main Conclusion Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary.

Tonal Structure and Form in Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra (I) Drew F. 
Bartók’s music, although it is often difficult to call completely tonal, never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure. 
We will also examine to what degree a “tonal” reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from common-practice compositional techniques. 
While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: the movement is in sonata form, but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement (not unheard of in Mozart sonatas), and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order. 
For example, the fifth string quartet. 
Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction. 
Hence, on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG-STG-FTG which makes the overall form, with the exception of the Introduction, symmetric. 
See Wilson, 168-170. 
example 1: formal structure of the first movement Sonata form—or, “more-or-less” sonata form—carries harmonic as well as formal connotations. 
To begin with, the movement is in F. 
Using this interpretation, we can map out the local tonics (tonal centers) used throughout the movement, as shown in Example 2. 
Bartók has often applied a tonic-dominant relationship to a pitch-class and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet. 
Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure. 
The Introduction As Paul Wilson points out, the title “Introduzione” given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures. 
The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece. 
The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale. 
The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive. 
example 3: measures 1-6 (celli and basses) example 4: measures 12-16 (celli and basses) example 5: measures 22-29 (celli, basses and violas) Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths. 
The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯, through F♯; these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭, E♭ and G♭. 
So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth. 
This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group (mm. 
Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second (-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples. 
So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement, within the first 29 measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole. 
This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in the outer voices in measure 51, although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor. 
(Example 7), are related to the first head motive of the first theme, which is shown in the first measure of Example 8. 
Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as “quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,” Wilson, 173. 
As mentioned, the first theme, the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8, contains two head motives: the first is the tritone-spanning ascent that appears in the first measure, and the second is an iteration of the interval cell (+5, -2, +5) that appears in the second through third measures. 
Rather, this motive is a small-scale representation of the tonic-dominant relationship of tritone partners, specifically F and B, that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement. 
Example 9 reproduces the chords, and Example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern. 
This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody (with its own “hiccups” occurring in the written 2/8 measures). 
E♭ is the tonal center for measures 95-134, although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131. 
The trombone motive in measures 134-141, shown in Example 12, is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development, although its importance is downplayed here. 
This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G♯-C♯-B-E (with the addition of some passing tones), in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths. 
E♭, furthermore, is not convincingly established as a dominant-functioning tone at all. 
However, as previously mentioned, C acts as a “fake” dominant that in measures 149-155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B, the “true” dominant. 
This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge. 
B dominates as tonal center from measures 155-191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it. 
A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195—another instance of the whole-tone being “filled in” by a fourth. 
Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E♭-D♭-B; the same stepwise descent (E♭-D♭) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged. 
In Example 2, the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches, and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal center—none of these pitches is involved in the structural whole-tone descent. 
Wilson, 180. 
Although it moves to E♭ minor in measure 239, it returns to D minor in measure 248, which suggests that E♭ is an upper neighbor prolonging D. 
example 13: measures 248-264 (violins) The second section of the development is in C♯ (which is sometimes spelled D♭). 
This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section. 
As tempting as this interpretation may be, this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology—there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms. 
The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures 316-318 by the strong V-I chord progression (Example 16). 
The resultant set is the pentatonic set F-B♭-E♭-A♭-D♭; the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set. 
example 16: measures 316-318: establishment of b♭ The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C. 
The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation. 
example 17: measures 316-340 (brass): fugato section example 18: measures 342-349 (horns): inverted fugato subject The Recapitulation The recapitulation, as we have seen, presents the themes in reverse order. 
It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D, which constitutes another “filling in” of the whole-step by the intervening fourth. 
Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467. 
In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody. 
Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum. 
To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra. 
It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive power—perhaps now we can understand why.

Lauren Ballinger 05/12/08 Reaching Transcendence through the Elimination of color: The Ideal Minimalism of Black and White The world is made up of a myriad of colors. 
What would our lives be without color? 
color is seen as corrupting, intoxicating, disorienting and in art, has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch. 
What is the significance for this preference for black and white when it comes to high art? 
What exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more specifically can black and white be considered non-colors? 
Seeing as color is something of the natural world, age old and archaic, washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above the physical world. 
Inorganic nature has only the language of color. 
The history of color is about the ways in which man has tried to find the ideal state of being throughout the ages. 
What is typical of this sort of ascetism is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal. 
For them, reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in its most minimal form. 
In the Elimination of color in the Far East, Izutsu explains though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine knowledge of color. 
In other words, the true profundity of the beauty of black and white is disclosed only to those eyes that are able to appreciate the splendors of sumptuous and glowing colors with all their delicate shades and tints”(Izutsu, p. 
For black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against a background of color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors in themselves as non-colors. 
It is up to the mind to fill in the blank space. 
colorlessness needs color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place. 
177). 
For in it’s negation of all colors, all colors are positively affirmed”(Izutsu, p. 
It is through these means that one finds the essence in a thing. 
color became a moral issue, seen as something sensuous and dangerous in its secondary nature to the essence of life and form. 
color is associated with the Fall from Grace. 
It deals with the body, emotions, not the intellect. 
color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization, the nobility of the human spirit, slowly, heroically, has lifted itself – but back into which it could always slide”(Chromophobia, p. 
White is seen as representing spirituality, the heavens, and light, it is all which is modern, it signifies the opposite of the carnal nature of color. 
“WHITE is the spiritual color of our times, the clearness which directs all out actions. 
We have superceded both the ‘brown’ of decadence and classiscm and the ‘blue’ of divisionism, the cult of the blue ky, the gods with green beards and the spectrum. 
47). 
Abolishing color means controlling color. 
It keeps an eye on all the objects it frames. 
151). 
On the other hand, we need color in order to distinguish black and white. 
“White is the setting for color.. 
The forms stand out clearly; the impeccable construction displays all its boldness. 
209). 
White helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash, it brings together and unites. 
The use of white is therefore decisive for the bodily appearance of a space. 
“In the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and disposition was surest and most convincing, all the details of the form and color of the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this background…In this a form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in “closed” spaces”(Wigley, p. 
There is another important aspect which white is representative of, and that is the well educated and socially elite. 
These distinctions proved a certain rational order, only attained by those able to afford of it. 
Crisp whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury, and leisure. 
The same goes with white walls, in their impeccability it proved to whoever, that the owner could afford to not live actually live in this space, or could afford more simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint. 
“..it is also worthy of remark, that savage nations, uneducated people, and children have a great predilection for vivid colors; that animals are excited to rage by certain colors; that people of refinement avoid vivid colors in their dress and the objects that are about them, and seem inclined to banish them altogether from their presence”(Chromophobia, p. 
Thus said, the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the vulgarity from the low. 
40). 
Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on this preference for black and white. 
Above all, it is believed that the expanse of literacy and the printed word, mainly the newspaper, had a profound effect in influencing the choice of black and white. 
This led to the idea of writing = rationality = production that confined images, especially images in color, to the emerging field of “art”, which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially unproductive, while it assigned to the two-toned and orderly world of printed paper the role of a daily guide to existence”(The Style Engine, p. 
The world of print was therefore seen as something serious for the modern man. 
This then translated down into the world of fashion, as seen with the distinction between black and white clothing, as well as art, namely photography but also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space. 
The explosion of mass production and printing allowed for a plethora of colorful advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as kitsch. 
In order to meet the demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the attention of consumers. 
Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas. 
Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same. 
Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money -- not even their time”. 
Avant guard at the time was considered to be true art, while this kitsch was simply pure imitation. 
Of course during the early stages of color film and photography, the quality was so poor that it gave a cheap look, whereas black and white film really allowed one to see the light and the shadows in the images. 
That was what made up the essence of an image, not the artificial, or superficial filling in of form with color. 
Photographers still use black and white and white is still the most widely used color for walls within gallery spaces. 
When something is black and white, it allows the mind to fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen. 
Whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non color, the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years. 
Thus is the ebb and flow of life. 
What, exactly, causes homosexuality? 
Others would argue that it is a result of a child’s upbringing. 
Perhaps then, it is a combination of some of these? 
in Isay 11). 
In fact, Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only “real and lasting love” and necessary for democracy. 
Even Homer wrote about Achilles and Patroclus, who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love (Emond). 
(However, for the purposes of this paper, homosexuality will be looked at solely in terms of men). 
Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for “same” and the Latin word for “sex,” whereas a heterosexual is a person” whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex” (Marcus 1). 
Hirschfeld also founded the Scientific Humanitarian committee, which was mostly homosexual, in 1897. 
He became known as one of the founding fathers of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological institute, the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in 1919, which was destroyed by the Nazis 15 years later. 
This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners, was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs, starting in1864. 
Ulrichs believed that Urnings were attracted to other males because they were “hermaphrodites of the mind,” meaning while they may have been male in body, they were female in soul and mind, leading them to be naturally attracted to males in terms of sexual partners. 
In an interview in 1903, he professed his beliefs: “I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people… Homosexual persons are not sick.

in Isay 3). 
Treatments such as castration, hysterectomy, lobotomy, and electroshock therapy were used as attempted cures. 
Dr. 
The American Psychological Association further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation in 1997, which publicly chastised those who attempted to “cure” homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment. 
Strangely enough, the study also included pairs of biological brothers that were not twins, and out of the 142 homosexual males studied, only 14, or about 9 %, had homosexual brothers, which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in the general population (Bailey & Pillard). 
As one grows older, they become aware of sexual feelings towards other persons. 
Rather, the only actual choice is whether or not to be open with one’s sexuality and sexual preference; whether to act on one’s sexual desires, whether to tell others about such feelings, or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions (Marcus 9). 
Dobbens believes that he was born homosexual. 
He went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it. 
He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction between males and females, only it was between males and other males. 
I’ve always been attracted to guys” (Woods). 
Though he has “always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],” these feelings come from his “romantic side, which is different from the sexual side” (Woods). 
He then went back to talk about homosexuality as in innate characteristic; “It’s like race. 
When asked if he thought homosexuality was caused by a gene, he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct. 
It’s not black and white [homosexual vs. 
Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics. 
For instance, heterosexual males have an average of five times as many children as homosexual ones, as a female is required to reproduce children, yet homosexuals are, by definition, not sexually attracted to females. 
Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool, if homosexuality was indeed caused by a gene, it would have died out entirely by now, or at least been reduced immensely in the number of occurrences. 
My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality. 
However this does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental factors.

Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. 
Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. 
But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. 
She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. 
But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? 
It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness.

While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. 
The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. 
This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. 
In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you.

would have been a satisfying ending. 
Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. 
She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. 
Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. 
This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. 
In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. 
Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations. 
An Extended Essay in History By Philosophy E. 
On that date Jennings Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell Works would close. 
Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills. 
Rather than sit back and wait for their jobs to be snatched away, the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able to keep the factories open. 
These well-intentioned efforts ultimately failed, leaving thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind. 
When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry. 
Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level. 
Their blast furnace, “Hopewell,” was the very first blast furnace in the area. 
Youngstown also was a major railway crossroads, due to its strategic position between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago. 
By 1880, Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16,000, which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period. 
This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when the Great Depression hit the area hard. 
Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth. 
This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down. 
Most importantly, Youngstown’s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive. 
Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000 jobs were lost countywide. 
However, it was clear that, in the words of USWA president Lloyd McBride, “If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.” The closings meant the end of Youngstown’s only real industry, the end of its population growth, and then end of economic progress. 
Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets. 
It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape. 
However, the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry. 
The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure. 
The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively. 
Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown. 
The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill. 
All these efforts eventually came to nothing, and Youngstown’s steel mills remained closed. 
Foreign steel was also much cheaper. 
Also, international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap labor. 
Labor costs in America continued to go up, draining US companies of their resources, while companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities. 
Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline, and it affected both domestic and foreign companies. 
America’s steel remained unsold, flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy. 
Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry, but it was not alone. 
J. 
Trying to prop up one city’s mills was impossible when faced with the depression that spread throughout the entire industry. 
As the name suggests, local leaders wanted to instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region. 
College tuition, clothes, food, and heating all had to come before donations to non-profit organizations. 
The lack of money proved to be crippling, because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively. 
Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down. 
People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did. 
The Apathy of USWA United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit. 
However, it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight, the international branch was not. 
Actually, one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do. 
It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings would be one of the worst in US history, and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered. 
Besides incompetence, the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism. 
If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism. 
Youngstown is the name of the major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself. 
Two blocks over one finds Boardman, a well-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools. 
Each town, with their own identity, instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and interactions between populations. 
With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would save their jobs and their futures. 
In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride. 
But to the thousands of people living there, the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic, political, and social futures. 
Hundreds more joined the unemployment lines, or even began living on the streets. 
The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on.

A funny-looking gift from your little sister that you keep anyway. 
Counting down with the microwave and making the funny beeping noise at the end, and then laughing hysterically. 
Milkweed seeds blowing on the wind. 
Learning an obscure word and wanting to use it every opportunity you get. 
Commendable effort! 
Ticking off the robot on AIM . 
Someone else’s birthday party. 
Colorful glass lamps that make designs on the ceiling. 
Looking at all the pretty ornaments in a gift shop and hoping feverently that you don’t knock something over. 
May. 
Oops. 
I’m just, uh, going upstairs now!” I shouted through to her as I rested my bike more carefully against the metal bars. 
Come here, please.” Dammit. 
The jail-like features suddenly changed to be more comfortable and homey. 
Heaven above, she was good. 
Adelle, with her usual soft glances and gentle demeaner, now looked angry. 
She tugged at her robe and played with a string of her curly hair. 
And, of course, there was the one, the only, Gianna. 
Well, actually, it might be a clone. 
Gianna simply stared at me. 
Her voice sounded strange. 
Listen!” Adelle’s hazel eyes bored into me. 
What was going on? 
Passing notes when the teacher isn’t paying attention. 
Band concerts! 
Catching snowflakes on your tongue and watching them melt. 
BEAUTY . 
LOVING YOURSELF . 
Knowing that the weather man predicted rain, but going outside anyways, and finding it’s impeccably sunny the whole day. 
Getting to a new level of a video game. 
Hearing a cat purr. 
Wrapping a present and using as much tape as you want, even it that may be the whole roll. 
SLEEPING . 
LAVENDER . 
He was wearing much what I had been wearing just a moment ago. 
I lifted my hand in a pathetic little wave. 
What’s your name?” “I think that’s the question I should be asking you.” I retaliated. 
The kid was sharp. 
“I am Maisie Beatrice Hampton, and I’ve come to see my grandmother. 
“Wait.” As soon as he disappeared my back slumped. 
How was I supposed to get past this body guard? 
“Hm...” He tapped his pencil on it. 
Harrisford, Virginia... 
Kiddo? 
“It’s Marie.” I looked up at him. 
Fallen Angel Thyme Passing 2008-11-11T10:26:25Z ID: 45852 Prequels: none Sequels: 45853 It was as bleak as a day could get, the day the angel fell from the heavens. 
The ground was littered with shriveled leaves that occasionally were lifted by the wind to travel several feet before dropping back to the dull grass. 
But as it descended, it grew larger. 
No, all the geese had left for the winter, and it was too large now. 
An eagle? 
No, it was too large, and it’s wings weren’t open. 
The creature was the flapping wildly, trying to regain flight, but it still fell, falling, falling, down to earth. 
It sounded like a hawk’s cry, it did. 
It was an angel! 
It’s big brown wings were twisted, and it was horribly cut from where it crashed into the tree, and yet it’s crashing into the tree very well might have saved its life, for the tree slowed its fall enough so that when it fell out of the tree, it was not hurt as badly as it would have been if it had landed on the cold, hard ground first. 
It was moaning, and occasionally it uttered a lamenting phrase in some incomprehensible language, and tears ran down its face. 
I knelt beside it, not sure if I should move it inside, or if moving it might just injure it more. 
The Bonesetter would know what to do. 
The Bonesetter lived not far away from my house, in a once-colorful gypsy caravan where he did his work. 
Breathless, I arrived at the caravan door, and knocked sharply upon it. 
“It’s hurt.” “I don’t treat animals,” he said, starting to close the door. 
“It’s an angel.” Awakening Thyme Passing 2008-11-11T12:30:04Z ID: 45855 Prequels: 45854 Sequels: 46178 It had been two days since the angel fell. 
The angel’s eyes fluttered opened, a startling green. 
The angel murmured and clacked something to itself in its soft, precise language, and stroked the cat with its unbroken hand, smiling. 
“Good morning,” I said, with not a little amount of awe. 
It said something in its language that I could not understand.“I don’t understand,” I said. 
It murmured a few more things to itself, in various languages, and then chanced upon English.“I am so sorry,” it said, and I saw tears in its green eyes. 
The rose quartz stone heart was just the size of her thumb print, and the gold ring circled it beautifully. 
She always held it when she was nervous. 
Her amber colored hair was pulled up into a high, upswept bun, and she pushed back one of her escaping curls. 
Zen, a large, muscular man in a loose robe stood in the crowd. 
It’s madness!

Impatiently he thrust away the covers and sat up, his legs dangling over the side of the bed. 
Sariah was missing. 
She hadn’t been at her bedroom window all evening. 
Always. 
They must suspect foul play. 
Had anyone looked? 
He knew what he would do, how he would help. 
Without a second thought he was out the back door and to the woods, a one man search party. 
He knew the paths.

Janice...” Another deep breath. 
She wonder if he could hear her heart racing. 
No one’s ever been as ridiculously perfect as you. 
I don’t know how all the other girls stand to be around such an exquisite being. 
They have to. 
I’d completely give up hope of ever having a boyfriend with you around. 
So I’m REALLY glad I’m not a girl.” Kyle paused for a breath, Janice couldn’t catch hers. 
he wondered. 
This was not the first time his home was simulated around him. 
On the contrary... 
“What’s going on here, Adelle?” he said and gave her his most disappointed, disapproving gaze. 
“Fame! 
Gianna is so good to you!” She seemed not to realize that the Gianna standing with them was just a hologram. 
She looked confused at first, then embarrassed, and finally ashamed. 
They took our families and separated them, our possessions and plundered them, and our hearts and broke them. 
The plan was of my weaving. 
What could a human do against a giant? 
They never guessed my treachery! 
I was subtle and sly. 
The man doubted his wife, and the woman questioned her son. 
Soldiers plundered the homes of their own people, and the people rebelled. 
It burned, and as it burned, we made our escape,and fled.

“But then I think, it does make sense because she’d never like that,” he was really picking up the pace now, “She’s not the type that goes around fluanting what she’s got and taking advantage, which makes you even perfecter. 
She shouldn’t rule my life. 
I know you think I’m being horrible, but I’m not.” She was acting defiant. 
“I think that’s for me to decide.” She recoiled, stung. 
I just want to protect you.” She was wheedling now. 
Which she probably was. 
“Listen, Adelle. 
I know all I need to know. 
“Oh, sure, Adelle.

Dammit, what is Tom up to? 
“Jim,” he says quickly. 
He has been observing the whole scene and disapproves of how Todd has been acting. 
“To put it bluntly... 
Todd nods to himself, thinking. 
Tom always was a jealous prick,” he splutters, his face displaying cold rage. 
“That’s a little harsh, boy, don’tcha think?” “I’m not a boy!” Todd snaps. 
Todd is also looking around but he can’t see anything but a ball-point pen that’s been crushed. 
Jim eyes Todd carefully, then asks. 
I’m fine. 
He’s waiting for a thank you or some kind of acknowledgment of his help. 
Angry, Jim says, “Fine.

Oh my god.” Harper stared down at her bent over stomach, where three miniscule rolls of fat had appeared. 
You’re a size two.” I stretched out over my bed, twirling a dark lock of hair on my finger. 
It was only expected. 
“Here we go, luvs.” Emilie plopped the soda’s down on the bedside table. 
Where have you been?” Emilie plopped down on the couch, pulling a down pillow onto her lap. 
I got here as soon as I could.” Demi’s hair was wind blown, and her nose was pink. 
I frowned. 
“Oh, um, hi Bella.” I smirked. 
He gasps as the cold seeps through his clothes. 
“Oooooo,” he groans, shifting on the cold ground. 
He can hear the sound of nearby cars driving by and he lifts an arm uselessly. 
His leg aches terribly. 
Tom pulls off his gloves and stares at his red hands in shock. 
As a last desperate hope he shoves his hands under his armpits. 
Never seen her before...” “Who, the redhead? 
Did she wander down here by accident? 
She’s the new recruit.” “Her?! 
No, you listen. 
She catches on quickly, see?

Pure coincidence could be an explanation, and it sounded like a good one, so I went with that and waved at him. 
Jared and I hung out almost everyday, and he was making me popular. 
I picked up my phone and looked at my recent call list to see if anyone would hang out today. 
A few outgoing.. 
It was a text from Jared. 
His eyes are frozen closed, and he moans softly at the touch. 
He can occasionally make out some voices, but only snippets of conversation. 
”....in the truck....hurt.......needs heat....” ”....him home...” “I know!” This last comment is louder than the rest and his eyes flutter open and catch a glimpse of a girl....a beautiful girl. 
Someone is rubbing his arms with soapy hands. 
The light is bright. 
Tom is astonished to find himself sitting in a white porcelain bathtub. 
No. 
All at once the realization comes, and then he hears a voice speak into his ear from behind. 
He is very aware that her breasts are pressed against his back. 
She grips him by the waist and hoists him back toward her. 
She squeezes it, and with the other hand begins to explore his thighs and the space between.

Finally, a noise came through and broke the silence. 
My fingers felt cold stone underneath them. 
Tiled marble floor lay underneath me. 
“Wants a letter about Spear. 
Comes up for sentence Tuesday.” “Spear?” repeated Arnold Thorndike. 
“I remember. 
“Went on the loose; had with him about five hundred dollars belonging to the firm; he’s with Isaacs & Sons now, shoe people on Sixth Avenue. 
The next morning he offered to make good, but Isaacs called in a policeman. 
They tried to withdraw the charge, but he’d been committed. 
A letter from you, sir, would—” It was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere. 
It was undoubtedly genuine, and he asked to be instructed by cable. 
With one eye closed, and the other keenly regarding the inkstand, Mr. 
The secretary withdrew the letter, and slipped another in its place. 
Says it will run to about five thousand dollars a mile.” “No!” protested the great man firmly, “blue flint makes a country place look like a cemetery. 
“I like his taking flowers to his mother.” “He SAID it was to his mother,” suggested the secretary gloomily. 
Thorndike. 
And he had the run of the house in those days. 
Don’t say more than that.” The secretary scribbled a mark with his pencil. 
But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. 
Mr. 
He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. 
A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. 
The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. 
A year from now where would young Spear be? 
It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man. 
“Stop at the Court of General Sessions,” he commanded. 
A word, a personal word from him to the district attorney, or the judge, would be enough. 
At that rate, keeping Spear out of prison would cost a thousand dollars. 
A policeman, chewing stolidly, nodded toward an elevator shaft, and other policemen nodded him further on to the office of the district attorney. 
He was again among his own people. 
He knew he could not escape recognition, his face was too well known, but, he trusted, for the sake of Spear, the reporters would make no display of his visit. 
But the outburst of approbation he had anticipated did not follow. 
"Henry Spear,” he exclaimed, “that’s your man. 
Andrews is in that court.” He walked to the door of his private office. 
He introduced an alert, broad-shouldered young man of years of much indiscretion and with a charming and inconsequent manner. 
Take him over with you.” The district attorney shook hands quickly, and retreated to his private office. 
Andrews took out a cigarette and, as he crossed the floor, lit it. 
Somewhat puzzled, slightly annoyed, but enjoying withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his reception, Mr. 
He decided that, in his ignorance, he had wasted his own time and that of the prosecuting attorney. 
As he understood it, Mr. 
There were people waiting in the room; strange people, only like those Mr. 
They leaned forward toward young Mr. 
Mr. 
“Judge is always late, anyway.” Mr. 
He wanted to protest, but his clear mind showed him that there was nothing against which, with reason, he could protest. 
He had precipitated himself into a game of which he did not know the rules. 
Next time he would know better. 
But he was not without a sense of humor, and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as amusing. 
He explained he would be a few minutes late. 
He gave rapid orders on many different matters, asked to have read to him a cablegram he expected from Petersburg, and one from Vienna. 
“It looks like peace.” Mr. 
Now he turned upon his visitors. 
Young Mr. 
“You gotta hell of a nerve to come to see me,” he commented cheerfully. 
Thorndike, the form of greeting was novel. 
“Was it you,” demanded young Andrews, in a puzzled tone, “or your brother who tried to knife me?” Mr. 
The hand of the banker went vaguely to his chin, and from there fell to his pearl pin, which he hastily covered. 
Young Andrews swung his swivel chair so that, over his shoulder, he could see Mr. 
“I HOPE so! 
That son of yours, Mrs. 
Thorndike. 
From the secure and lofty heights of motherhood, Mrs. 
She did not even deign a protest. 
The smile reminded Thorndike of the smile on the face of a mother in a painting by Murillo he had lately presented to the chapel in the college he had given to his native town. 
He’s robbed you, robbed his wife. 
“Could you give me a pass?” she said. 
“Isn’t that just like a mother?” he protested. 
And I’ll bet she’s got a cake for him in that basket!” The mother laughed happily; she knew now she would get the pass. 
Thorndike bowed his head politely. 
Apparently there were many aspects and accidents of life not included in his experience. 
Their looks were anxious, furtive, miserable. 
At a door a tipstaff laid his hand roughly on the arm of Mr. 
Again, in his effort to follow, Mr. 
“All right,” he signalled, “he’s with Mr. 
You’re with ME.” Distinctly annoyed, slightly bewildered, the banker sank between the arms of a chair. 
Andrews had become his sponsor. 
Because Andrews had a pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among police-court lawyers. 
“The judge’ll be here in a minute, now,” said the assistant district attorney, and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the judge’s bench. 
Andrews. 
To Mr. 
He arose, and touched his sleeve. 
The court attendant droned loudly words Mr. 
There was a rustle of silk, and from a door behind him the judge stalked past. 
On his shrewd, alert, Irish-American features was an expression of unnatural gloom. 
Thorndike observed that it was as little suited to the countenance of the young judge as was the robe to his shoulders. 
Thorndike was still smiling when young Andrews leaned over the rail. 
Mr. 
The banker had not believed the young man could look so serious. 
’You’ve got to wait till your man comes up. 
Not knowing in what way he had offended, but convinced that it was only by the grace of Andrews he had escaped a dungeon, Mr. 
The clock on the wall showed him that, already, he had given to young Spear one hour and a quarter. 
No one better than himself knew what his time was really worth. 
And the one man who could answer them was risking untold sums only that he might say a good word for an idle apprentice. 
He assured his honor that he must have more time to prepare his case. 
The name of a most respectable business house was involved, and a sum of no less than nine hundred dollars. 
The contrast struck Mr. 
Unknowingly, he laughed, and found himself as conspicuous as though he had appeared suddenly in his night-clothes. 
“Those persons,” he said, “who cannot respect the dignity of this court will leave it.” As he spoke, with his eyes fixed on those of Mr. 
Thorndike, and grinned sympathetically. 
“Should have warned you. 
“As soon as this fellow finishes his argument, the judge’ll take up the sentences. 
It won’t be more than a couple of hours now.” “A couple of hours!” Mr. 
A couple of hours in this place where he had been publicly humiliated. 
Those who made it their business to study his expressions, on seeing it, would have fled. 
Thorndike began grimly to pull on his gloves. 
Andrews nudged his elbow. 
“That’s Mrs. 
What did I tell you; mothers are all alike. 
She knows you’re her one best bet.” Impatiently Mr. 
“And here come the prisoners,” Andrews whispered. 
Third man from the last.” A long line, guarded in front and rear, shuffled into the court-room, and, as ordered, ranged themselves against the wall. 
Spear, his head hanging, with lips white and cheeks ashen, and his eyes heavy with shame. 
At the sight of the great man, Spear flushed crimson, and then his look of despair slowly disappeared; and into his eyes there came incredulously hope and gratitude. 
Austin says,” continued the district attorney, “she’s looked into this case, and asks to have the man turned over to her. 
A thin, washed-out, pretty woman stood up, and clasped her hands in front of her. 
The woman broke into vehement assurances. 
Would she take him back? 
She held out her hands as though she would physically drag her husband from the pillory. 
Part Two Other men followed, and in the fortune of each Mr. 
Only these actors were appearing in their proper persons in real dramas of a life he did not know, but which appealed to something that had been long untouched, long in disuse. 
He found this, partially, in praising, through Andrews, the young judge who had publicly rebuked him. 
Thorndike found him astute, sane; his queries intelligent, his comments just. 
“Like her clear eyes and clean skin. 
These men when they come under her charge,” he insisted, eagerly, “need money to start again, don’t they?” He spoke anxiously. 
It was a desire to help; to be of use to these failures who had fallen and who were being lifted to their feet. 
“Anything you give her,” he answered, “would be well invested.” “If you will tell me her name and address?” whispered the banker. 
In helping here, he felt a genial glow of personal pleasure. 
Thorndike. 
I’ll see what it is. 
Thorndike pulled him back. 
“But I can’t see him now, I’m busy.” Slowly the long line of derelicts, of birds of prey, of sorry, weak failures, passed before the seat of judgment. 
Behind him stood a younger man, a more modern edition of the other. 
The judge nodded, and leaning forward, for a few moments fixed his eyes upon the prisoner. 
He laid his hand upon a pile of letters. 
These letters speak for you; your employers, whom you robbed, have pleaded with me in your favor. 
In the eyes of the law, that is no excuse. 
It appears you can not. 
Therefore, you must not drink. 
Andrews. 
Spear was free, and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving toward the door. 
Mr. 
Even though the result relieved and pleased him, he wished, in bringing it about, he had had some part. 
His morning had been wasted. 
The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to the neglect of their own interests, came to assist the ends of justice, and fellow-creatures in misfortune. 
“The law, Mr. 
“It wishes only to be just. 
But when there is good in a man, I, personally, want to know it, and when gentlemen like yourself, of your standing in this city, come here to speak a good word for a man, we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen. 
Thorndike glowed with pleasure. 
From the friends of Spear there was a ripple of applause, which no tipstaff took it upon himself to suppress, and to the accompaniment of this, Mr. 
He was pleased with himself and with his fellow-men. 
And then he saw Spear standing apart regarding him doubtfully. 
Thorndike took it, and shook it, and said: “I want to meet your mother.” And when Mrs. 
And she remembered it, too, and thanked him for the flowers. 
And Isaacs & Sons were delighted at the great man’s pleasantry, and afterward repeated it many times, calling upon each other to bear witness, and Spear felt as though some one had given him a new backbone, and Andrews, who was guiding Thorndike out of the building, was thinking to himself what a great confidence man had been lost when Thorndike became a banker. 
They pounced upon the banker and almost lifted him into the car. 
“There is not!” answered Mr. 
His tone was rebellious, defiant. 
“I’ve wasted most of this day,” he declared, “and I intend to waste the rest of it. 
“Wait till I get my hat!” he called. 
Andrews laughed aloud. 
Thorndike raised his eyebrows inquiringly. 
This work is hereby released into the Public Domain. 
Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. 
Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. 
We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. 
One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. 
The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. 
Last year, I rented a small house on Vega IV, a sea world, all islands and reefs and archipelagos, turquoise waters and aquamarine skies, sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova. 
The N'apulcans are mostly emigrants from Polaris II; the only difference between them and their Carribbean ancestors is that the ancestors fleeced NorAm tourists. 
I don't mean to sound cynical. 
The following events may indicate otherwise. 
The rental agent, an attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not mood-sensitive either. 
But she was young and attractive (as I have said and may say again) and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism. 
She caught herself, slid her jaw infinitesimally back into place, and said, "You don't like it?" I laughed. 
I clapped her shoulder to show I was not laughing at her. 
I should buy it to raze it, but I am not so kind-hearted. 
"You will?" "It amuses me. 
Not even Los Mundos is so polite. 
I stared. 
"Worse?" I nodded. 
"It is rather ugly." "Thoroughly ugly," I corrected with smile. 
"Don't you dare!" Her wrist, when I grabbed it, was smooth and strong and warm in my fingers. 
The interior of The Flamingo was a welcome surprise. 
The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired. 
My heart convulsed, and I left this manuscript for a three-day spree. 
Not bad for an eighty-three-year-old, even for one who has his rejuve every month. 
No. 
My mindsmith is not so understanding. 
Why else would I come to you?" This logic does not soothe her; she says I must wait three weeks. 
Such is the law. 
Enough. 
I hope the wipe is as successful with my time on Vega IV as my spree was with my time here. 
I will not answer the phone for a week, no matter whose face appears on it. 
But which issue? 
To deal with the first: it hurts to remember. 
The sufferer says no, only those which cause no pain. 
Is that love? 
You loved her. 
The Tasha in this file is not even the Tasha I loved and thought I knew. 
I must also write about Emiliano Gabriel Malaquez. 
Not another spree --at least, not like the other. 
I want to pick up with Tasha and me walking about The Sleeping Flamingo, and then, for the sake of literary convenience, to say that from a corner of the yard I saw a neighboring house, and the sight filled me with darkest forebodings. 
"Who lives there?" I asked. 
Truth is always more boring than fiction. 
how does one speak to one's future self? 
I do not plan to write a book: this narrative must move more quickly. 
I made some small joke afterward, about approving of her firm's business incentives, and she cried. 
I moved into The Flamingo the next day; and she gave up her apartment three weeks later to join me. 
(Which is to say, you and me, Future Self.) Who was Tasha Cortez? 
Her family said she did it to support her father, who was dying of a particularly painful degenerative disease. 
She did not like my plays. 
That bothered (yes, and intrigued) me until I realized that she was bored by most plays, movies, and vid. 
I often told her that she should have a bio-check to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance. 
Moreover, he never did portraits of famous people; his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared to it. 
The shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that we're looking at an instant snatched from under the hooves of time. 
Yes, Self, I am also bothered that this observation ignores half-eaten cheese sandwiches, incomplete insect collections, and locks of infants' hair, forgotten in closets, basements, and warehouses. 
The play's second act concludes with the last fight between Tasha and me. 
Now I will mention it, in case I/You decide to restore it. 
Nardo! 
"You wish to become pregnant? 
Especially when someone thinks me shockingly ignorant. 
The child's face was a warground for wonder and mistrust. 
The stars themselves might have fallen on the Undersider and the event would have been no less strange, no less miraculous. 
"Well. 
If I thought he could free me from you --" "Hah!" She wrapped her arms around my stomach. 
Wondering about the reason for her extravagance, I asked how work had gone that day. 
He's taking Dream's End." "Emil?" "You've no memory left, old one. 
You did that to test my affections." "What?" "Calling him by his first name. 
We lunched together. 
I do not claim ours was a perfect affair, only a wonderful one. 
I invited him to dinner tomorrow." "Oh?" "He'll be our neighbor. 
But knowing this did not mean I wanted it. 
She screamed, "I haven't socialized with Terra's elite for most of my life! 
And I invite a neighbor, one nice, lonely man --" "I'm sorry." " --who took me to -- What?" "I'm sorry. 
Instead, I asked, "Is he handsome?" "You're jealous." "A tiny bit. 
It's the reverse of you with those ridiculous stomach muscles. 
I'll eat two dinners tonight. 
Who said that those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it? 
Add this to the reasons I write now: to remember something, perhaps even to learn -- Emil Malaquez arrived after sundown, carrying a small package wrapped in what looked like real paper. 
He was a jovial man with an easy laugh, and even uglier than Tasha had suggested. 
"Señor Malaquez?" "Please. 
"Has she said as much about me?" "She thinks you are a genius. 
"Emil!" She leapt up. 
It's unforgiveable, but you're forgiven." She nodded at the package. 
I stopped writing, and only the thought that I might miss the mindwipe kept me from another spree. 
Perhaps they recognized a fellow ghost. 
The side of Malaquez's parcel gave way to reveal a greenmunk caught in a sheen of solid air. 
Tasha oohed in awe. 
He lives around here somewhere. 
"Why 'Frodo'?" Tasha said, "A little fellow with big, furry feet. 
I almost dropped it; I expected it to weigh no more than a holo. 
Be glad someone didn't toss that to you." He spoke of his art with the enthusiasm of a seven-year-old. 
"A confession, and then a request. 
It's not easy for me to ask a favor." "Relax," I said. 
The surprising thing is that I was. 
My last show --" " --was glorious!" Tasha said. 
"But an artist who would stay first among his fellows can tell when he begins to fail." "Oh?" I hoped no one would bring up my last three plays. 
No more urchins, dopers, vagrants, or whores. 
"Would you permit me to do one of you? 
"Ah." He shrugged lightly. 
Oh! 
"And you as well? 
Catching herself, she said casually, "Oh..." And then she smiled, laughed loudly at herself in the way that always made me think how much I loved her, and said, "My God, yes, yes, yes!" For a perfect moment, Emil and Tasha and I were one entity, laughing until our lungs hurt. 
I had not considered that I might not write to learn, but to punish myself. 
Then we went out for a late swim. 
I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. 
So, I think, did she. 
She had no choice but to follow. 
Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of "Captured Moments.") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments. 
Tasha looked at me as if to say, "I will." She said, "I feel sorry for you, Nardo. 
Emil asked, "You're all right?" I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent. 
I waited, and drank a glass of MorningAfter and three cups of coffee, and wondered whether our affair could survive the events of the night, and whether I wanted it to. 
Malaquez answered the door in blood-red pajamas and a black silk robe. 
I merely said, "Is Tasha here?" He pursed his lips slightly, then nodded. 
I hold it against neither of you. 
Let me talk to her." "I --" "Please." He looked me and at last said, "Very well." We walked through his house in silence. 
A tall, narrow stopbox stood in the center of one room; sand trickled forever downward while beads of water splashed across the sand's path. 
But then, I was in no mood to consider art. 
That was easier than despising myself. 
"I should go in first. 
"She handles surprise surprisingly well." "What would it hurt?" "True. 
Tell her..." I shrugged. 
I didn't anticipate last night --" "I'm very good at making things happen this way. 
I waited in the dark, carpeted hall. 
She was looking slightly to my left, smiling with trust and satisfaction like one sexually content. 
Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them, it shimmered around Tasha. 
Malaquez was not prepared for me to react so quickly, or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not have, a gesture I would not make, a poignant moment of repentence, wonder, despair, or love. 
I threw a chair at him. 
I shouted, "Where is she? 
I hit him with the back of my hand. 
She did! 
Our boat would disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose. 
I wanted him to tell me more, but he babbled, begging me to forgive him, to understand. 
I took the capturador, a matte black Tiempo Capturado, from his grip and studied it, not really thinking about it or Malaquez or Tasha. 
Or perhaps I was thinking about the things that humanity made that would outlive our species. 
Had he said then that I should use it on myself, I might have. 
I looked at Malaquez. 
She smiled in trust or pleasure or pride, an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever, and I could never know why. 
I could free Tasha. 
Most likely: she would be meat --there is a reason why stopboxes are most often used in kitchens. 
And the tiniest chance of all: she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emil's bedroom, and then she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal. 
And Tasha? 
But I cannot stop thinking that I was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death. 
>Hotel California Fact: Sound is a vibration. 
Eyes bulging in panic, but no screams. 
Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave. 
Metaphorically, of course. 
This is more than the person would have sans space suit. 
About the time I was composing my last words in my head, trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like, that's when I heard a bell. 
Twenty-four hours of silence (vacuum, remember); was I hallucinating noises now? 
It was a fine bell, reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals I'd seen in documentaries. 
Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright. 
The first words they said to me meant nothing. 
Next to those, nothing else mattered. 
(I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.) When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around. 
And me, I guess I was one more piece in their puzzle. 
I was now one of them. 
The survivors of the unfortunate accidents, the catastrophic malfunctions, the fateful crashes: this is us. 
Once found, we can never be lost. 
We can never leave. 
You do this a lot?” A woman, introduced as Tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful, shrugged. 
“You fit the bill. 
She turned to me. 
No time for answers. 
The occasional painting hung on the wall (generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met, primarily). 
This was heaven. 
“Where are we going?” I asked. 
What's our destination?” Tiffany, she stopped walking. 
“Honey,” she said, “You're going to be delighted. 
Destination nowhere.” This was hell. 
Fact: The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit is three hundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per second. 
I've heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock; I guess I was working my way through them. 
Initially, I couldn't figure out why—I hadn't requested any be sent. 
The accompanying bottle of wine was a nice touch. 
I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed, staring up at the little etched swirls in the ceiling, or slumped in the old-fashioned armchair, staring out the windows at the stars. 
Man, was it good to be done with that stage. 
Fact: Hell is other people. 
We didn't pick up many passengers—just the select, special few, scattered here and there between the stars. 
Cliques form in any decent-sized group of people. 
She sidled up to me as I was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro cream dip onto a plate. 
Luxurious, even compared to the fare one would find in the high-class space stations and pleasure cruisers. 
“Liking the taste of the sweet life, eh? 
“Come on, let's get you a glass of champagne.” I looked longingly at the slices of cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar, but didn't protest. 
It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with a nod, moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her. 
Clearly, it was a high-end model. 
I spent the evening listening, mostly. 
No one minded; Sarah's inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter. 
Zheng, short and dark and lean, with a very intense gaze. 
Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist. 
Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so had been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact. 
I wasn't learning anything useful. 
Tonight was for observation. 
They all looked the same: clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt, the hangers-on, the circle with whom the gossip was shared. 
All the fine food and the ornamental lighting, it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain. 
How they were all powered was a mystery—as good as the technology got, a quality robot like that was still an energy sink. 
This ship. 
The nagging questions about where the ship had come from and what its purpose in rescuing me was still nagged, but somehow, seemed less urgent. 
Fact: It's easy to fall into patterns. 
I would join the rest of the ship for meals, and I would take my turn in the weight room. 
I did not ask questions. 
I told myself that tonight, the observation period would end and I'd start puzzling out the ship's mystery. 
Bereft of my previous familiar life, I latched onto Kishori and Ray and Zheng, and Sarah with Alexis dragged along on her arm now and then (he was mostly her favorite dancing partner; she confided to us one night that his conversational skills left something to be desired). 
I continued to care little for shipwide gossip, but our discussions of films and flicks, old and new, brought out my artistic, story-loving, argumentative side, a side of me I'd tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an engineer. 
But I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end. 
Days passed, weeks passed, but I couldn't tell if it had been months or years since I was rescued. 
Gathering for drinks in the parlors, playing dress up with all the fine clothes I found in the closets (some of it modern, some of it period dress for special themed events), idling in the lounges. 
Other faces washed out, fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the engines. 
(The 'South' was in the title to suggest that there were more ballrooms. 
Maybe it was her curiosity, asking a question I should have asked long before, that turned the conversation serious; maybe there was just something special about that evening. 
Regardless, when Adrienne asked what the ship's purpose was, we all gave it a measure of thought. 
“I believe we'll see the end of the universe,” said Tiffany. 
She swirled it speculatively. 
She tilted her head, listening, not speaking. 
“We can't live that long.” “Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think,” said Jefferson. 
He didn't drink, but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques. 
“Maybe we're already traveling at the speed of light.” Tiffany, she nodded eagerly. 
We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us.” “And?” said Sarah. 
Besides, I wouldn't mind being around forever. 
Keep their dreams alive.” “New hypothesis,” suggested Kishori, slipping into the conversation. 
In fact, the opposite: We're all going to die.” “Bleak,” commented Zheng. 
Ray took a drink from his glass of ice water, and shook his head. 
“All the luxuries money can buy.” Tiffany took a drink, thinking. 
Matter-of-fact. 
“Think about it,” Kishori continued, “where else would we get the money to buy all this?” “Renegade smugglers. 
Jefferson shook his head and stood up. 
A chorus of good nights followed him out the door. 
He set his glass down on an end table, steepled his fingers together. 
“And I don't mean that you disgust me. 
Did you hear what the captain said earlier? 
“Inside intelligence? 
Me, I followed Adrienne's example and didn't speak up (fabricating excuses to myself to stay safely in gather-info observation mode), though I thought Zheng had a point. 
I guess we all figured, he knew what he was doing. 
“What we do, rebelling against the oppression of the many governments that oppose us, we're going to leave a legacy.” He sounded certain. 
Ray, he shook his head, and broke the quiet he'd held most of the evening. 
“Obviously, we can't last longer than the rest of the universe. 
We're not even going to leave a legacy. 
All we're doing is eating and drinking and shitting, breathing and fucking and nothing important, ever. 
Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet. 
“You never know when it will end,” Ray continued, not addressing any one of us in particular. 
How long until the memories slip away? 
When your life, the reason you lived, the people and faces and places, the emotions you felt, who and what you loved, when all that is gone, faded, what will you have left?” I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship. 
I wanted to ask, but he was still talking, and I was too self-conscious to interrupt. 
You can make their names your mantra. 
We won't care that we're last and we won't care that there are no more stars. 
“Leaving your wife, I mean. 
“I don't know,” he said. 
Silent. 
“What's your theory?” she asked me. 
“How long have you been here?” “Not that long,” I said. 
Maybe a month or two.” “Why don't you know for sure?” she asked. 
I hadn't been counting days. 
How were you found?” “I was an engineer.” I explained how my ship had malfunctioned, no warning at all. 
“I don't know how Jefferson knew to find me there.” She nodded. 
It was all so fast.” She took a sip of her drink, plain water because, she had explained earlier, she had never liked the taste of alcohol, then fixed her gaze on me. 
“How and why this ship exists. 
Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns. 
Another evening, another chandeliered room, another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d'oevres. 
I assumed he was indisposed.” Kishori nodded in agreement. 
“What?” “Well,” Ray said, slowly, “People do leave. 
Zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table. 
A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out the people, won't make a difference.” He dropped the pecans back into the dish, one by one. 
Kishori chewed her lip. 
I hazarded a guess. 
No one offered a different answer. 
Mission accomplished: Our routine insouciance had been disrupted. 
Even when the conversation returned to lighter tones, as it soon did, I dwelt on Adrienne's questions. 
“How long have you been here?” The question, previously posed to me, was presented to the rest of our group (excluding Ray; Adrienne had been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill, recalling the last time the subject was broached). 
“A long time. 
“Time passes in a weird way here. 
I guess I didn't see the point.” Fact: Some places are timeless. 
“Days don't matter,” he said. 
“Why are you so interested?” she asked Adrienne. 
“I don't want to be here forever.” “But we're not here forever,” objected Sarah. 
Alexis left.” “Disappeared,” I corrected her. 
Or where he went.” Zheng looked thoughtful. 
He glanced around at the rest of us. 
“Could you live anywhere else now?” I spoke up. 
“I wouldn't miss this, much.” No one else said anything. 
Fact: I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end. 
The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful. 
There was a schedule advertising upcoming on-ship events, such as dance classes, craft sessions, and discussion groups, and a list of dinner invitations for me to respond to. 
A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the ship. 
A methodical search of my two adjoining rooms, the ample closet space, and the attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder. 
I wanted to find something, anything, that would prove all this was normal and sane. 
I wanted my contentment back. 
In one hand I balanced my plate of star-shaped crackers, globs of elegant dips and garnishes, little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant, and an array of other delectable, bite-sized items. 
She glared at me, but obediently let me pull her along. 
She gave me a grumpy look that informed me, quite clearly, of her current opinion of me. 
“I don't know much,” she said, still annoyed but at least cooperative. 
I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side, talking to a couple people, and they must not have known I was there. 
And listen, when they came round the corner, Ray was with the captain.” The next time the captain stopped by our group, Tiffany tagging along (pretending that she, too, was a social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone), we were ready. 
“Down past the Emerald Lounge, second door on the left. 
Medical AI were even more expensive than the barkeep. 
Had anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill? 
“The captain?” I shrugged. 
“That doesn't answer my question,” she said. 
“Not hungry?” asked Kishori sympathetically. 
“At least have a drink,” said Sarah. 
“Maybe that's the problem,” said Sarah. 
“You ever heard of Dunbar? 
“If you dislike this place so much, why don't you do something about it?” “We can't,” said Ray. 
“That's survival, ” Adrienne corrected her. 
I shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge, looking out the windows at the stars. 
All of it was temporary, save for the black. 
Everything temporary. 
Thinking about that, I wondered if Sarah's theory was right after all. 
He made this ship—this life—a constant. 
The one thing that wouldn't change. 
Maybe we'd never know each other, not truly, because we all hid behind the stories, creating the realities we wanted to see. 
We each had our own theory. 
Maybe it made us feel less alone. 
She smiled, then crossed the room to join me by the window, not waiting for an answer. 
All these things I do, they're just to pass the time until I die.” Adrienne looked at me, then back out through the window. 
After all of it, as much as we feared being alone, we feared being vulnerable even more. 
“Look what I found,” Adrienne said. 
And what happens to Adrienne? 
Jefferson was in the Captain's Lounge, Fact: Sound is a vibration. 
“Up his dosage,” I heard the captain say. 
I didn't want to forget. 
The last thing I remember, I was tearing down the corridors. 
Every ship had life boats. 
I'd find one. 
A planet. 
Some other ship. 
Ray, he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls, finding no glass to break. 
“It'll pass,” he told me. 
It passed. 
I can never leave. 
The gentle constant breeze of recycled air from the vent above blew an annoying hair against her nose, but she ignored it. 
"Tarrin says the planet's a freaking gemstone! 
Of all the impertinence! 
That's what I get for not using mercenaries. 
Mahogany-black curly hair, cut short in the typical military style framed a careworn, dark-skinned face. 
She had the look of every leader she had ever known. 
You look like hell, Tar. 
Don't let fatigue get to you. 
She seemed so depthless - self conscious and shallow on the outside, but having that incredible gift. 
Well, if she didn't pan out, she'd be terminated. 
He was what this was all about. 
His pointed ears swiveled back and forth, catching every sound from the bridge, while his long tail swished to the rhythm of his thoughts. 
Right now, he looked like an overgrown wolf who'd learned touch-typing. 
It's hail crackled across the comm, and Tara spun to retake her seat at the helm. 
Won't Central be crushed to learn that another gateway has yielded little more than a class F planet and a white dwarf system. 
This sounds like it's the one." The distinctive whuffle of pleasure rippled through the betas on the bridge, and Rakal let loose a small growl, as if to caution his charges against false hope. 
Tara would not let giddy hopes drag them onto a rock that would spell the end for the project, and the Arrallin species. 
Ranney Nathan’s Bylichka Dedicated to Neil Gaiman, Radiohead and Black Sabbath Strange things have always happened to my family. 
When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, "No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us. 
Boston is a strange place at night. 
It was a Friday night. 
She checked it there in the restaurant. 
I’m not sure I’m up for a night out.” I was feeling calm and private that night. 
“Okay, Rachel. 
“Let’s not get fucked up tonight, though, okay, Rache? 
Come on, I don’t have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself. 
It was dark enough that I could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light. 
If it was March, that meant that we’d been together almost a year and a half. 
Now spring was back, under the concrete, and I could smell it even here. 
Even the city feels alive when spring comes.” “Taxi!” She waved down a car and pulled me in. 
After she paid the driver, she grabbed my arm, laughing, and we ran down the street. 
The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ’s toolkit and his beer. 
A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ’s moving sermon. 
I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. 
When she hadn’t come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. 
Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn’t see anyone else there. 
He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn’t see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. 
The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. 
The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. 
I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong. 
I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck. 
I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light. 
It was still a mess, but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared. 
The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through the stained glass, catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry, healthy warmth into the edges of the room, through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights. 
Standing in the center of the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police. 
What? 
She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her. 
My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help! 
I understand.” The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight. 
Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise. 
Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran. 
Walking didn’t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more. 
It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry. 
I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it. 
“Hey,” said a male voice, “do you need some help?” I turned around. 
“Really, I’d like to help. 
I’m just fine. 
We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s best to start now.” I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat. 
“Okay,” I said. 
Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now? 
I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours. 
“I will help you find your Rachel. 
Something in his tone couldn’t be disbelieved. 
If she’s in trouble, I want to find her, wherever she is.” My driver took a deep breath. 
You see, Nathan, there is …separate from your society …oh, damn it. 
My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year. 
Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog. 
“Hey,” I said, “are you sure that we should be going this way? 
“You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.” That just unnerved me more. 
I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings. 
“Okay, this is the spot,” said my driver, pulling over. 
“Is it really safe to leave the car …” he was already walking toward the squat, brick-windowed building we were parked next to. 
I hopped out, ran after him, and reached him just as he was knocking on the door. 
Inside, the building opened up. 
It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub. 
“Nice, my man,” he said as they clasped hands. 
Did I ever tell you about them?” “Yeah, one time, man, but you were pretty fucked up. 
His skin was brown and stretched, like some diseased sapling’s bark. 
When he grinned, I saw that his teeth were sharp and small, like a hunting cat’s. 
Nepthys quickly answered for me. 
Nepthys nodded: “It’s okay, you can trust him. 
It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly. 
“I get that all the time around here.” “He was wearing a sort of jacket …maybe blue velvet, I couldn’t tell in the dark, but it had ruffles at the throat, things like that. 
That’s why I couldn’t understand why no-one else remembered him. 
I remember that he hardly ever moved, just stared at Rachel. 
I don’t know how he could’ve been heard over the music.” The two glanced at each other. 
“I’ve looked into it a little, and I do think we might be dealing with one of them. 
I can send you to a guy who knows all about them, though. 
We should head straight over. 
Here, let me write down how to find him.” The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail, then handed it to Nepthys. 
Good luck!” “Thanks, Dvorov. 
Let’s go.” That last one was to me. 
He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor. 
The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog: it had a leeching, heavy dimness. 
A corpulent, batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle. 
Thirty-five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed. 
“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver. 
“We interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction. 
“The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours. 
Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner, with the right protective spells.” He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us. 
We should get started right away. 
Setting an arm on my shoulder, he said, “Nathan, what you see here might be frightening, but those things you saw are people just like you. 
It’s very reassuring that I’ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity.” “Nathan, you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel. 
In this world, one’s word is a promise. 
“Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name.” “You’ve got a deal. 
What you may call me is Nepthys.” Holding Dvorov’s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway. 
Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence. 
East is that way.” He pointed at the wall to our right. 
Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.” I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner. 
Try to keep in time with me.” We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust. 
When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner. 
“Are you coming?” We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town. 
Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs. 
The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar. 
Its face was small and wrinkled, with penny-sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose. 
“There are no finer to spice a meal, nor purer to mix a potion. 
If – ” “You know what I mean. 
I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons.” It hissed thoughtfully. 
We entered. 
Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls. 
“We’re here for information about a vampire,” said Nepthys. 
“Sorry, kid. 
Frankly, I don’t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire. 
So they’re probably worse than we think, okay, that’s great. 
Okay? 
Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman. 
Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed, who had not moved. 
As you can see, our situation is of personal importance to the young man. 
It would be a great help to us.” The little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden room’s tight air. 
I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm.” “Sir, we simply want to discover whether this individual is, in fact, a vampire. 
I tried to keep myself calm. 
It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness. 
“You have our thanks.” Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone. 
When we reached the street, I expected some sort of temple, or a row of antiquaries, or at least a sleazy, black-market relics merchant. 
Nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them. 
Inside, the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions. 
A large woman, similarly decorated, quickly drifted up to us. 
“May I invite you to have a cup of tea?” “No, thank you,” said Nepthys, “we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer. 
“I am Madame Entera, at your service. 
“Are you? 
Please, walk this way.” She led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen. 
After this, we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside. 
“This is a slave shop,” he explained quietly. 
As she brought out the key, she said, “We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items. 
This is one of the stranger items, though. 
If we only had a human on our staff, we could have done so ages ago and sold it off, but we have no such luck.” She opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room. 
“A marvel, isn’t it?” she said. 
“What would convince you to part with it?” She considered this, looking him over. 
“He looks healthy,” she said, “how about a pint of his blood?” “A pint? 
“Well, kid, what do you think? 
There was a wooden chair, where she sat me down and asked me to wait. 
“Roll up your sleeves,” she told me. 
It must have been larger than my finger. 
The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker-mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow, where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin. 
“They take about a quarter-pint each,” said Madame Entera, drawing out another skinny leech. 
We’ll be done with them before your hair is finished.” Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber. 
At least the barber hadn’t nicked me. 
“Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,” the woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him. 
“Come on,” said Nepthys, “you could use a drink.” We hit a bar on the next street over. 
Make it extra bloody.” When our drinks came, he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary. 
“You could run on empty with a little of that stuff. 
“Drink up, kid.” I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery. 
“I think that our world is a reflection of yours, or yours is a more boring reflection of ours. 
In America, things are still weird after the European conquest. 
The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities. 
Some of them actually commit to this society, though. 
One wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something. 
They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school. 
How did you get to America?” “My parents came over from Russia, just like your family. 
“Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka? 
I can drink like a fish, kid. 
Still woozy?” I nodded. 
Come on, let’s go.” As we left the bar, I asked to see the rock. 
“I’m just curious. 
Nepthys tried to grab it, but, by reflex, I caught it first. 
Then there was light, a kind of rosy glow, and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air. 
“Do you know what this thing does?” I shouted, hardly able to hear myself. 
There was no sign of the stone. 
The girl was as soft and rosy as the stone’s glow, and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot. 
When she didn’t move, I knelt down and put a hand to her brow. 
I couldn’t move. 
I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation, but Nepthys stopped me. 
The next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what she’ll respond to until we figure out how to put her back.” I was at a loss. 
I stood up and Amy stood with me. 
“What!” he screamed. 
You woke it up? 
Fools! 
…I thought as much. 
Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck. 
I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.” I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts. 
Come on, we’re heading out.” He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs. 
“Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me. 
It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front. 
The black door opened as we came up to it, and a pale man opened the door. 
I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity. 
From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”. 
Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.” The man closed his eyes. 
Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up, taking Amy’s small hand so that she wouldn’t lag behind. 
Amy gave my hand a squeeze. 
I thought that I saw one rib shift in its setting, like a cat trying to scratch its back against a wall, but when I turned, it was still. 
Inside, the space opened into a wide, square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size. 
These were incontestably male. 
As she rose, her robes fell open and I realized that, except for what looked like a red silk kimono, she was naked – naked and stunning. 
“It’s been years since I’ve seen you. 
“The girl is …surprising,” he concluded. 
I took it and, dropping to one knee, gave her fingers a small kiss. 
“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,” I said. 
“Oh, precious! 
You may leave out the ‘Lady,’ boy. 
“Now, how can I help the elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge? 
“May I have a little more of what you gave me before, Nepthys?” I asked. 
The wine’s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar, but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth. 
“You’ve lost blood, boy? 
Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved?” “It was part of the price for this girl, who was a rock at the time,” explained Nepthys. 
“That sweet, small nose, and her soft lips – she’d kiss well, I should think, if gently. 
Good, round breasts, too, even though they’re small, they suit her.” Amy didn’t blush, and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying. 
He was going to give us valuable information for her.” “Now I understand why you’re here,” said Isis. 
“Mmm,” she replied. 
“I think that the person who stole the girl we’re looking for might be a vampire. 
Describe this one to me. 
If not, you’ll have to bring me something to work with.” Nepthys looked at me. 
Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full, hanging breasts. 
“That’s amazing!” “It is. 
He should be. 
“All right, then. 
The glow reflected on her pink face, casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat-strong cheeks. 
Her candy lips twisted into a frown. 
In her palms, the droplets of blood swelled into small pools. 
The pools in her hands grew deeper. 
Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake. 
Shivers swept through her body, and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him. 
Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out, splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs. 
Isis collapsed on the fur, strings cut. 
“Isis, what happened? 
“What did you say?” asked Nepthys. 
“I found your vampire,” she said, “but he might know that someone’s looking for him. 
You should look for him at Dvorov’s as quickly as you can.” She turned to me with tired sympathy. 
Hurry, though, and you might find him before he leaves.” A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants. 
I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her. 
I turned back to the door. 
When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood. 
“Mountain ash,” said Nepthys. 
“I really hope we find your Rachel,” he said. 
“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,” said Nepthys. 
The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart. 
You got the sucker already?” “No, but we got a tip that he might be in your club. 
You’re crazy. 
“Anyway, long time, man.” “That’s odd. 
I have a real feeling that he’s in here somewhere.” Dvorov glanced over his shoulder, a little nervous. 
I don’t want my customers thinkin’ that anything’s wrong, you know?” “Of course. 
“So did you get anything out of the guy I sent you to?” Dvorov asked us. 
I guess I probably should’ve known, though. 
“Anyway, this is the dance floor, man. 
Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking. 
Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me, pressing me into the wall, but I took a breath and kept moving. 
The music began to build, and a strobe came on. 
Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me. 
Dvorov was somewhere behind me, too, negotiating delicately through his patrons. 
It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf. 
Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers, I started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this. 
A cold thing with countless, writhing tentacles fell against me, thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose, tripping me and clutching at my limbs. 
Then a looming shape to my right fell away, and I saw him in a flash of the strobe, his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd. 
A bleeding, eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me, but I ducked around it and toward the bar. 
It was Dvorov. 
“You seen enough, man?” he shouted. 
He’s sitting right there at the bar!” Dvorov tried to peek through the crowd, but it had shifted again and we couldn’t see a thing. 
“It must have been wishful thinking.” “No, I saw him! 
Who knows how long he’ll stick around?” “Listen, man, he’s not there! 
“Don’t do this, kid! 
Even if you did find this vampire cat, he’d tear you apart! 
Suddenly, Amy screamed. 
His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off. 
He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back. 
A heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up. 
Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand. 
“He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,” he said by way of explanation. 
The crowd parted for us. 
In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room. 
We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us. 
Luckily, the vampire turned off after three stories. 
Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight. 
I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him. 
The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me. 
Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere. 
On the steps in front of the altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women. 
Behind you!” I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head, leaping like a panther. 
There was Nepthys, on the other side of the pews, holding the wooden box in his hand. 
I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes. 
I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face. 
My arms shook from the force of his throw. 
His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards. 
Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between the pews. 
I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine. 
Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb. 
My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, “This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.” Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack. 
I could perceive Nepthys’ sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone. 
Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar. 
A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.” I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected. 
I stood and turned toward the altar. 
I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing. 
The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth. 
I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar. 
I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me. 
The Black Willow Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close. 
After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. 
The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards. 
The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin. 
Although the concept was a simple one, Allan thought it had potential. 
Perhaps this will be more saleable, he thought and began to write. 
I'm almost done, and the happy ending is just falling into place. 
As he thought this, a sinuous wind encircled the house, slipping through the walls to chill him. 
This was no stranger, however; the twisted, ancient thing was older than Allan, its branches rapping on his window since his childhood. 
The great, jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author, who gazed up through his window's tiny frame with trepidation. 
His pen flickered forth, words dancing out from its nib. 
For while the lantern's spark shivered in the chill breeze, this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owner's pen, scratching out the rhythm of the willow's fingers. 
He held a hand to his forehead, eyes closed and face flushed. 
After all that – so near the end, to lose control again. 
His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears, he draped his loose cape over her shoulders. 
A magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the sky's glory. 
"Damn you," he cried, "will you never leave me be? 
The next day, Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well-furnished parlor. 
"Cucumber sandwich?" Allan took a sandwich between his fingers. 
Clemm?" "Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. 
Poe's works, but I assume you're referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic." "It's far from a 'penchant,' Arthur. 
"I'm sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption." "I know," Allan replied, "but how am I to do that? 
There simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience, at least." "It is true," Allan admitted, fidgeting with his cufflinks, "that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher. 
My prodigal ink-blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road." Arthur sighed and sipped his wine. 
It's hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print, like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd." Allan hung his head, holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees. 
He scratched the back of his dark-haloed head and blinked bleary eyes. 
"You might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat, improve your disposition." "Perhaps it would," Allan replied, rising and vainly straightening his suit. 
You have been a gracious host, as always." Arthur rose and shook his hand. 
"I hope soon to see you in better sorts." They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate. 
His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy. 
"I destroyed another story last night, Nathan." Leaning against his tree, Nathan shook his head. 
Ended! 
Nathan, you've read these abominations of mine. 
At best, they are faery tales; at worst, expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see." "So instead, you would write – what?" "Something saleable; something worth reading, worth writing! 
Why do you ask?" "You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter, though you face such difficulty. 
I would not be happy, thus separated from it." "So at its heart, then, your writing – as opposed to working otherwise – is for yourself?" "Yes, I suppose one could see it thus. 
"Your writing is for you, Allan, not for the publishers or some imagined audience. 
Your stories strike a chord with the deepest, most ancient stories of mankind, the tales basic to humanity. 
He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. 
Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. 
He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward. 
"What is this?" he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand. 
"What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing," cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice. 
"This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!" He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat. 
Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare??" For a moment, Allan could hardly do more than shake his head. 
"Its twigs rap constantly against the wall, the wind always demanding my attention. 
Clemm? 
"Nathan would understand completely." Even as he said it, Allan prayed that his statement was true. 
If you insist on abandoning me, I shall not hold you." With that, he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room. 
He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken, making his way past his host's doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathan's residence, several miles away. 
Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself, a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period. 
Allan leaned forward unconsciously. 
"So," he asked, "you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?" "Heavens, no," said Nathan, aghast. 
Oh, they may rail against you at first; they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage; but while those in power say such things, others will read your tales and see their true worth. 
Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him, then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face. 
Certainly, it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them. 
These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home. 
Arthur paused in the door, looking up at Allan for a moment; then he turned and shut the door behind him. 
As they trotted forth, Allan's eyes remained trapped by the carriage, following it up the hillock and past himself. 
He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done. 
A mass of flaming wood stood before him, heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house. 
His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers. 
Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all. 
He stepped slowly beneath the branches, a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great, swirling eddy, a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow's last breath. 
Indeed, if he still could not, he could at any time follow Arthur's advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality. 
He found himself along the bank of a low, wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current. 
As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants. 
Emerging from between the antediluvian trunks, Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped. 
Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet; the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees, still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers, sprang up where branches reached the ground. 
Allan stumbled forward, jaw slightly slack, until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted, three-trunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself. 
WARTIME After the attacks had occurred, while crisis managers were still sorting out a number of unnerving false alarms, Air Force One flew to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. 
While the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington, by the time Air Force One was airborne at 9:55 A.M. 
President Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and, at about 10:10, Air Force One changed course and began heading due west. 
The Secret Service was also interested in refueling the aircraft and paring down the size of the traveling party. 
When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about 11:45, personnel from the local Secret Service office were still en route to the airfield. 
Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the President's remarks, while the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security situation with superiors in Washington. 
The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several days, if necessary. 
At about 3:15, President Bush met with his principal advisers through a secure video teleconference. 
That evening the Deputies Committee returned to the pending presidential directive they had labored over during the summer. 
For the first time in history, all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United States were grounded, stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country. 
The Pentagon had been struck; the White House or the Capitol had narrowly escaped direct attack. 
In the late afternoon, the President overruled his aides' continuing reluctance to have him return to Washington and ordered Air Force One back to Andrews Air Force Base. 
. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks, joined the discussion. 
IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME As the urgent domestic issues accumulated, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten chaired a temporary "domestic consequences" group. 
It began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the flowing losses to the American economy, such as Organizing federal emergency assistance. 
Compensating victims. 
Determining federal assistance. 
Restoring civil aviation. 
Reopening the financial markets. 
Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal operations. 
The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems of protection and preparedness. 
By September 14, Vice President Cheney had decided to recommend, at least as a first step, a new White House entity to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of combining them in a new department. 
Vice President Cheney reviewed the proposal with President Bush and other advisers. 
Some (such as Zacarias Moussaoui) were actually in INS custody before 9/11; most were arrested after. 
Ashcroft ordered all special interest immigration hearings closed to the public, family members, and press; directed government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were "cleared" of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies; and ordered the identity of the detainees kept secret. 
Records indicate that 531 were deported, 162 were released on bond, 24 received some kind of immigration benefits, 12 had their proceedings terminated, and 8-one of whom was Moussaoui-were remanded to the custody of the U.S. 
The inspector general of the Justice Department found significant problems in the way the 9/11 detainees were treated. 
The government's ability to collect intelligence inside the United States, and the sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement communities, was not a priority before 9/11. 
However, the attacks of 9/11 changed everything. 
A central provision of the proposal was the removal of "the wall" on information sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities (discussed in chapter 3). 
The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 26. 
(2) Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals? 
First, we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals, domestic or international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of September 13, 2001. 
Second, we found no evidence of political intervention. 
The issue came up in one of the many video teleconferences of the interagency group Clarke chaired, and Clarke said he approved of how the FBI was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency discussion at his level. 
. 
to handle that, to check to see if that was all right with them, to see if they wanted access to any of these people, and to get back to me. 
The President and Vice President told us they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the media. 
The Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart. 
They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion. 
PLANNING FOR WAR By late in the evening of September 11, the President had addressed the nation on the terrible events of the day. 
The long day was not yet over. 
From the White House staff, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card were part of the core group, often joined by their deputies, Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten. 
The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of the attacks, but also those who harbored them. 
He said we would need to build a coalition. 
Secretary Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might have harbored the attackers, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, and Iran. 
President Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September 12. 
The President tasked principals to go beyond their pre-9/11 work and develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them. 
Rice chaired a Principals Committee meeting on September 13 in the Situation Room to refine how the fight against al Qaeda would be conducted. 
The United States would need to integrate diplomacy, financial measures, intelligence, and military actions into an overarching strategy. 
They concluded that if Pakistan decided not to help the United States, it too would be at risk. 
Armitage said that the United States wanted Pakistan to take seven steps: to stop al Qaeda operatives at its border and end all logistical support for Bin Ladin; to give the United States blanket overflight and landing rights for all necessary military and intelligence operations; to provide territorial access to U.S. 
Pakistan made its decision swiftly. 
request for support in the war on terrorism. 
To counterbalance that he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his decisions." At the September 13 NSC meeting, when Secretary Powell described Pakistan's reply, President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban. 
The President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban, step back, wait to see if they got the message, and hit them hard if they did not. 
President Bush also tasked the State Department, which on the following day delivered to the White House a paper titled "Game Plan for a Political- Military Strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan." The paper took it as a given that Bin Ladin would continue to act against the United States even while under Taliban control. 
demands for the Taliban: surrender Bin Ladin and his chief lieutenants, including Ayman al Zawahiri; tell the United States what the Taliban knew about al Qaeda and its operations; close all terrorist camps; free all imprisoned foreigners; and comply with all UN Security Council resolutions. 
The State Department did not expect the Taliban to comply. 
Both departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence, basing, and other support from countries, according to their capabilities and resources. 
stance: America would use all its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat, punish those responsible for the 9/11 attacks, hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to terrorists, work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks, and avoid malice toward any people, religion, or culture. 
But the early briefings to the President and Secretary Rumsfeld on military options were disappointing. 
The existing Infinite Resolve options did not, in his view, amount to such a plan. 
He proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would join the fight against al Qaeda. 
President Bush later praised this proposal, saying it had been a turning point in his thinking. 
It drew on the Infinite Resolve "phased campaign" plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November 2000 as an addition to the strike options it had been refining since 1998. 
After hearing from his senior advisers, President Bush discussed with Rice the contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion. 
"The purpose of this meeting," he recalled saying,"is to assign tasks for the first wave of the war against terrorism. 
President Bush directed Secretary of State Powell to deliver an ultimatum to the Taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed. 
President Bush instructed Rumsfeld and Shelton to develop further the Camp David military plan to attack the Taliban and al Qaeda if the Taliban rejected the ultimatum. 
Finally, he directed Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to craft a plan to target al Qaeda's funding and seize its assets. 
Also by September 18, Powell had contacted 58 of his foreign counterparts and received offers of general aid, search-and-rescue equipment and personnel, and medical assistance teams. 
demands. 
The pre-9/11 draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive, National Security Presidential Directive 9, now titled "Defeating the Terrorist Threat to the United States." The directive would now extend to a global war on terrorism, not just on al Qaeda. 
It included a determination to use military force if necessary to end al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan. 
The old draft directive on al Qaeda became, in effect, the first annex. 
The goal was the "elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life." "PHASE TWO" AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein's regime might have had a hand in it. 
As a former pilot, the President was struck by the apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting, especially Hanjour's high-speed dive into the Pentagon. 
Speculating about other possible states that could be involved, the President told us he also thought about Iran. 
"See if Saddam did this," Clarke recalls the President telling them." See if he's linked in any way." While he believed the details of Clarke's account to be incorrect, President Bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to Clarke at some point, asking him about Iraq. 
The memo found no "compelling case" that Iraq had either planned or perpetrated the attacks. 
Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak, the memo pointed out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein's regime. 
On the afternoon of 9/11, according to contemporaneous notes, Secretary Rumsfeld instructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible. 
He thought the U.S. 
The secretary said his instinct was to hit Saddam Hussein at the same time-not only Bin Ladin. 
According to Rice, the issue of what, if anything, to do about Iraq was really engaged at Camp David. 
Rice told us the administration was concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the 9/11 attacks. 
Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for striking Iraq during "this round" of the war on terrorism. 
It argued that of the three, al Qaeda and Iraq posed a strategic threat to the United States. 
Secretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitz-not Rumsfeld-argued that Iraq was ultimately the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked. 
"Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with," Powell told us." And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to deal with the Iraq problem." Powell said that President Bush did not give Wolfowitz's argument "much weight." Though continuing to worry about Iraq in the following week, Powell said, President Bush saw Afghanistan as the priority. 
Iraq was not even on the table during the September 15 afternoon session, which dealt solely with Afghanistan. 
At the September 17 NSC meeting, there was some further discussion of "phase two" of the war on terrorism. 
interests, with plans to include possibly occupying Iraqi oil fields. 
Writing to Rumsfeld on September 17 in a memo headlined "Preventing More Events,"he argued that if there was even a 10 percent chance that Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attack, maximum priority should be placed on eliminating that threat. 
The next day, Wolfowitz renewed the argument, writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef 's co-conspirator in the 1995 Manila air plot in crashing an explosives-laden plane into CIA headquarters, and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis' involvement in the attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight. 
On September 19, Rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked on their contingency plans. 
He knew he would soon be striking the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. 
On September 20, President Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the two leaders discussed the global conflict ahead. 
Some members of his administration, he commented, had expressed a different view, but he was the one responsible for making the decisions. 
Having issued directives to guide his administration's preparations for war, on Thursday, September 20, President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session of Congress." Tonight," he said, "we are a country awakened to danger." The President blamed al Qaeda for 9/11 and the 1998 embassy bombings and, for the first time, declared that al Qaeda was "responsible for bombing the USS Cole." He reiterated the ultimatum that had already been conveyed privately." The Taliban must act, and act immediately," he said." They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate." The President added that America's quarrel was not with Islam: "The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends. 
In Phase One, the United States and its allies would move forces into the region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan and Pakistan. 
The Phase Two strikes and raids began on October 7. 
In Phase Three, the United States would carry out "decisive operations" using all elements of national power, including ground troops, to topple the Taliban regime and eliminate al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan. 
Afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the Taliban. 
support, engaged al Qaeda elements in a cave complex called Tora Bora. 
In Phase Four, civilian and military operations turned to the indefinite task of what the armed forces call "security and stability operations." Within about two months of the start of combat operations, several hundred CIA operatives and Special Forces soldiers, backed by the striking power of U.S. 
They had killed or captured about a quarter of the enemy's known leaders. 
air strike. 
In turn, the U.S. 
With these initial victories won by the middle of 2002, the global conflict against Islamist terrorism became a different kind of struggle. 
It is possible to achieve better results at lower costs, but not if we simply add yet another program on top of all of the existing regulations. 
Significant cost savings can be achieved for power generators and consumers through a comprehensive legislative package. 
556 as drafted. 
In addition, the combination of emission reductions and timing is not feasible and could threaten the reliability of electricity supply. 
556 would make some existing requirements unnecessary, but would not eliminate them. 
556 should eliminate those unnecessary existing requirements. 
556 also does not have an allocation scheme. 
556 will cost consumers too much and endanger our energy security by causing too much electricity generation to switch from coal to natural gas. 
For all of these reasons, the Administration must oppose S. 
In my testimony today I will elaborate further on these key points. 
Eleven years ago President George H. 
Bush signed into law the most far reaching amendments to the Clean Air Act since its enactment in 1970. 
It is time to revisit and update the Clean Air Act once again in order to achieve the additional reductions needed to address public health and environmental problems in the most cost effective manner. 
Allowances are the currency with which compliance with the SO2 emissions requirements is achieved. 
Units that reduce their emissions below the number of allowances they hold may trade allowances with other units in the system, sell them to other sources or save them for future use. 
Allowance trading provides incentives for energy conservation and technology innovation that can both lower the cost of compliance and yield pollution prevention benefits. 
The Acid Rain Program has proven to be an excellent model for cap and trade programs. 
Greater reductions earlier than expected have lowered risks to human health and provided benefits to the environment sooner. 
Administrator Whitman addressed these concerns extensively in her testimony before you on July 26, 2001. 
1 Governor Whitman's July 26, 2001, testimony before this Committee contains a detailed discussion of the success of the Acid Rain cap and trade program. 
• NOx emissions contribute to ground-level ozone, which aggravates respiratory illnesses and causes lung inflammation, particularly for at-risk populations such as children, the elderly and those afflicted with asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory ailments. 
Children born to women who consume large amounts of mercury-contaminated fish while pregnant may be at risk for neurodevelopmental defects. 
EPA, states, and industry, working together, have made important strides in addressing the adverse impacts of fossil fuel combustion by the electric power industry since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. 
Over the years, Congress, EPA and the States have responded to specific environmental and public health problems by developing separate regulatory programs to address the specific problems. 
Absent changes to the Act, EPA and states will be forced to follow the same approach in future regulations. 
A comprehensive legislative approach with mandatory caps could replace a good portion of the current regulatory requirements with a system that will reduce the administrative burden on industry and governments, use market-based approaches to lower compliance costs, reduce consumers' costs, and increase national energy security by providing the industry with more certainty about its future regulatory obligations. 
If we do it the President's way, it will be a win-win. 
These regulations include both federal and State requirements that address a variety of emissions including SO2, NOx, CO, PM10, and a number of hazardous air pollutants. 
Emissions reductions are required by the end of 2007. 
It is expected that the existing fine particle and ozone standards now in place will also result in further regulation of power generators. 
States will be required to develop plans for these areas. 
Because states and EPA will have to find some way to significantly reduce NOx and SO2 emissions, it is probable that power generators will be required to reduce their emissions significantly. 
Additionally, states know that if they do not get the reductions from power generators, they will have to impose significant reduction requirements on other local industrial and commercial sources or impose local transportation control measures. 
States will not just control their own sources, however. 
This is what has happened in the eastern part of the country when states realized that emissions from sources in other states were significantly contributing to their 1-hour ozone non-attainment problems. 
The petitioning state is entitled to relief if EPA finds that the sources are significantly contributing to the petitioning state's nonattainment problem. 
This one-at-a-time, uncoordinated series of regulatory requirements for the power industry is not the optimal approach for the environment, the power generation sector, or American consumers. 
Further, the attainment efforts of individual States and localities not only impose costs on these entities, but also can increase complexity for companies which face differing requirements when operations cross state lines. 
These and other inefficiencies point to the need for a nationally coordinated approach that could reduce cost while improving environmental progress and accountability. 
This Administration is developing such a proposal. 
Integration, advance knowledge, and certainty regarding environmental requirements will have even greater value over the coming decade as the electric power industry undergoes further structural changes. 
In exchange for flexibility in methods to control emissions, a full accounting of emissions through continuous monitoring and reporting is essential, as well as significant consequences for failing to comply. 
Flexibility stimulates technological innovation, fuels economic activity and reduces cost to industry and consumers. 
The air pollution control and monitoring technology industry is expected to continue to respond with cost-effective compliance solutions just as they have done for the past 30 years. 
This approach also would reduce states' administrative burdens and obligations. 
Additionally, the Acid Rain cap and trade program is administered with a relatively small staff relying on strong, state-of-the-art data tracking and reporting capabilities. 
Consideration of local concerns is important in conjunction with trading provisions. 
Several guidelines are shaping our efforts. 
They will also guide our assessment of other proposals, including S. 
These principles are structured to ensure consistency with the NEP objectives. 
Specific Comments on S. 
556 to significantly reduce and cap emissions of SO2, NOx and mercury from power generation. 
In this way, S. 
We do, however, oppose S. 
Finally, we oppose inclusion of CO2 in this bill. 
We are concerned that the significant emissions reductions are required too quickly. 
To meet these deadlines, facilities may need to be taken off-line during critical periods. 
The abbreviated time frame would force many generators to make these retrofits simultaneously. 
We have not modeled the specific provisions in S. 
In the Smith/Voinovich/Brownback analysis, when we analyzed SO2 and NOx reduction levels similar to S. 
556 and no CO2 reductions, we did not find significant impacts on coal production or electricity prices. 
556, we found significant ramifications: approximately a 20-30% decline of coal generation and a 30-50% increase in electricity prices compared to the reference case (depending on assumptions of energy technology penetration). 
We have not seen anything that demonstrates that every coal-fired power plant would be able to achieve 90% source-specific controls for mercury by 2007, without considerable fuel switching, which would be very disruptive to our economy and undermine energy security. 
We are also very concerned about the "outdated power plant" provision. 
Allowing sources to make reductions where it is most economical to do so is one of the reasons cap and trade programs should be less costly than command-and-control programs that achieve the same or even fewer reductions. 
556, requiring emission reductions at a specific source does not reduce the overall level of pollution, it just limits industry's flexibility about where to make the reductions. 
Second, we have concerns about what is not in S. 
Comparing our experience on the Acid Rain Program with the NOx SIP Call and the Section 126 petitions demonstrates the benefit of having certain key issues decided by Congress rather than left to Agency rulemakings. 
Perhaps the most important program element not addressed in the bill is integration of this new program with the existing Clean Air Act provisions. 
For example, depending on the ultimate cap levels chosen by Congress, this type of legislation would obviate the need for Best Available Retrofit Technology requirements, mercury MACT, and new source review case-by-case technology requirements for power generators. 
556 is the scheme for allocating allowances. 
Should the allowances be auctioned off or be handed out for free? 
Should power generators that do not emit air pollutants (e.g., hydropower facilities) be given allowances? 
Should allocations be fuel neutral? 
The Committee may also wish to consider provisions to track environmental progress to evaluate the efficacy of the program this bill would establish. 
556 or any multi-pollutant bill. 
The Administration will not support any legislation that would cause a significant decline in our nation's ability to use coal as a major source of current and future electricity. 
In short, the Administration supports a clean coal policy as a critical component of our nation's energy and environmental policies, recognizing that other sources of energy also have a critical role to play. 
We agree that climate change is a serious issue we need to address. 
The current body of scientific knowledge does not provide information regarding atmospheric concentrations of CO2 or reduction levels necessary to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. 
In that regard, the Administration is implementing two major initiatives on climate science and advanced energy and sequestration technologies. 
The "National Climate Change Technology Initiative" will accelerate priority research and the application of advanced energy and sequestration technologies, recognizing that the real answer to addressing climate change in the long term lies in the development and global introduction of such technologies in this century. 
Finally, as greenhouse gas emissions are projected to grow exponentially in the developing world in the next two decades, we must evaluate the costs of imposing domestic reductions as a very high cost against potentially low-cost opportunities for mitigating and sequestering carbon emissions in the developing world. 
556 in generating important discussions and emphasizing the importance of a new approach to controlling emissions in the power sector. 
The history of Clean Air Act legislation is one of great accomplishments made possible by bipartisan efforts. 
CONCLUSIONS OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS INQUIRY COMMISSION The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission has been called upon to examine the financial and economic crisis that has gripped our country and explain its causes to the American people. 
Our task was first to determine what happened and how it happened so that we could understand why it happened. 
The subject of this report is of no small consequence to this nation. 
This was a fundamental disruption—a financial upheaval, if you will—that wreaked havoc in communities and neighborhoods across this country. 
About four million families have lost their homes to foreclosure and another four and a half million have slipped into the foreclosure process or are seriously behind on their mortgage payments. 
Businesses, large and small, have felt the sting of a deep recession. 
Many people who abided by all the rules now find themselves out of work and uncertain about their future prospects. 
The impacts of this crisis are likely to be felt for a generation. 
Like so many Americans, we began our exploration with our own views and some preliminary knowledge about how the world’s strongest financial system came to the brink of collapse. 
Yet all of us have been deeply affected by what we have learned in the course of our inquiry. 
Those decisions—and the deep emotions surrounding them—will be debated long into the future. 
In this report, we detail the events of the crisis. 
When the bubble burst, hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in mortgages and mortgage-related securities shook markets as well as financial institutions that had significant exposures to those mortgages and had borrowed heavily against them. 
The losses were magnified by derivatives such as synthetic securities. 
Panic fanned by a lack of transparency of the balance sheets of major financial institutions, coupled with a tangle of interconnections among institutions perceived to be “too big to fail,” caused the credit markets to seize up. 
The stock market plummeted. 
The financial markets have become increasingly globalized. 
There is broader access to and lower costs of financing than ever before. 
From 1978 to 2007, the amount of debt held by the financial sector soared from $3 trillion to $36 trillion, more than doubling as a share of gross domestic product. 
By 2005, the 10 largest U.S. 
On the eve of the crisis in 2006, financial sector profits constituted 27% of all corporate profits in the United States, up from 15% in 1980. 
Now to our major findings and conclusions, which are based on the facts contained in this report: they are offered with the hope that lessons may be learned to help avoid future catastrophe. 
The crisis was the result of human action and inaction, not of Mother Nature or computer models gone haywire. 
To paraphrase Shakespeare, the fault lies not in the stars, but in us. 
The tragedy was that they were ignored or discounted. 
Yet there was pervasive permissiveness; little meaningful action was taken to quell the threats in a timely manner. 
The Federal Reserve was the one entity empowered to do so and it did not. 
The sentries were not at their posts, in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self- correcting nature of the markets and the ability of financial institutions to effectively police themselves. 
To give just three examples: the Securities and Exchange Commission could have required more capital and halted risky practices at the big investment banks. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other regulators could have clamped down on Citigroup’s excesses in the run-up to the crisis. 
Policy makers and regulators could have stopped the runaway mortgage securitization train. 
In case after case after case, regulators continued to rate the institutions they oversaw as safe and sound even in the face of mounting troubles, often downgrading them just before their collapse. 
From 1999 to 2008, the financial sector expended $2.7 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses; individuals and political action committees in the sector made more than $1 billion in campaign contributions. 
Too many of these institutions acted recklessly, taking on too much risk, with too little capital, and with too much dependence on short-term funding. 
They took on enormous exposures in acquiring and supporting subprime lenders and creating, packaging, repackaging, and selling trillions of dollars in mortgage-related securities, including synthetic financial products. 
Many of these institutions grew aggressively through poorly executed acquisition and integration strategies that made effective management more challenging. 
Too often, risk management became risk justification. 
Often, those systems encouraged the big bet—where the payoff on the upside could be huge and the downside limited. 
Our examination revealed stunning instances of governance breakdowns and irresponsibility. 
We conclude a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency put the financial system on a collision course with crisis. 
In the years leading up to the crisis, too many financial institutions, as well as too many households, borrowed to the hilt, leaving them vulnerable to financial distress or ruin if the value of their investments declined even modestly. 
By one measure, their leverage ratios were as high as 40 to 1, meaning for every $40 in assets, there was only $1 in capital to cover losses. 
To make matters worse, much of their borrowing was short-term, in the overnight market—meaning the borrowing had to be renewed each and every day. 
It was the equivalent of a small business with $50,000 in equity borrowing $1.6 million, with $296,750 of that due each and every day. 
And the leverage was often hidden—in derivatives positions, in off-balance-sheet entities, and through “window dressing” of financial reports available to the investing public. 
For example, by the end of 2007, Fannie’s and Freddie’s combined leverage ratio, including loans they owned and guaranteed, stood at 75 to 1. 
When the housing downturn hit, heavily indebted financial firms and families alike were walloped. 
As the mortgage and real estate markets churned out riskier and riskier loans and securities, many financial institutions loaded up on them. 
And again, the risk wasn’t being taken on just by the big financial firms, but by families, too. 
In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections— the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, federal deposit insurance, ample regulations—to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued America’s banking system in the 19th century. 
Key components of the market—for example, the multitrillion-dollar repo lending market, off-balance- sheet entities, and the use of over-the-counter derivatives—were hidden from view, without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns. 
We had reaped what we had sown. 
As part of our charge, it was appropriate to review government actions taken in response to the developing crisis, not just those policies or actions that preceded it, to determine if any of those responses contributed to or exacerbated the crisis. 
Other agencies were also behind the curve. 
This was in no small measure due to the lack of transparency in key markets. 
Some regulators have conceded this error. 
While there was some awareness of, or at least a debate about, the housing bubble, the record reflects that senior public officials did not recognize that a bursting of the bubble could threaten the entire financial system. 
When Bear Stearns’s hedge funds, which were heavily invested in mortgage-related securities, imploded in June 2007, the Federal Reserve discussed the implications of the collapse. 
In addition, the government’s inconsistent handling of major financial institutions during the crisis—the decision to rescue Bear Stearns and then to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, followed by its decision not to save Lehman Brothers and then to save AIG—increased uncertainty and panic in the market. 
We conclude there was a systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics. 
Unfortunately—as has been the case in past speculative booms and busts—we witnessed an erosion of standards of responsibility and ethics that exacerbated the financial crisis. 
They resulted not only in significant financial consequences but also in damage to the trust of investors, businesses, and the public in the financial system. 
This data indicates they likely took out mortgages that they never had the capacity or intention to pay. 
The report catalogues the rising incidence of mortgage fraud, which flourished in an environment of collapsing lending standards and lax regulation. 
As early as September 2004, Countrywide executives recognized that many of the loans they were originating could result in “catastrophic consequences.” Less than a year later, they noted that certain high-risk loans they were making could result not only in foreclosures but also in “financial and reputational catastrophe” for the firm. 
And the report documents that major financial institutions ineffectively sampled loans they were purchasing to package and sell to investors. 
THESE CONCLUSIONS must be viewed in the context of human nature and individual and societal responsibility. 
As you read this report, you will see that specific firms and individuals acted irresponsibly. 
At the same time, the breadth of this crisis does not mean that “everyone is at fault”; many firms and individuals did not participate in the excesses that spawned disaster. 
These individuals sought and accepted positions of significant responsibility and obligation. 
THIS REPORT DESCRIBES THE EVENTS and the system that propelled our nation toward crisis. 
When housing prices fell and mortgage borrowers defaulted, the lights began to dim on Wall Street. 
Many mortgage lenders set the bar so low that lenders simply took eager borrowers’ qualifications on faith, often with a willful disregard for a borrower’s ability to pay. 
During the same year, 68% of “option ARM” loans originated by Countrywide and Washington Mutual had low- or no-documentation requirements. 
As irresponsible lending, including predatory and fraudulent practices, became more prevalent, the Federal Reserve and other regulators and authorities heard warnings from many quarters. 
And the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, caught up in turf wars, preempted state regulators from reining in abuses. 
It appeared to financial institutions, investors, and regulators alike that risk had been conquered: the investors held highly rated securities they thought were sure to perform; the banks thought they had taken the riskiest loans off their books; and regulators saw firms making profits and borrowing costs reduced. 
From the speculators who flipped houses to the mortgage brokers who scouted the loans, to the lenders who issued the mortgages, to the financial firms that created the mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), CDOs squared, and synthetic CDOs: no one in this pipeline of toxic mortgages had enough skin in the game. 
As it turned out, these losses were concentrated in a set of systemically important financial institutions. 
Its complexity has erected barriers to modifying mortgages so families can stay in their homes and has created further uncertainty about the health of the housing market and financial institutions. 
The enactment of legislation in 2000 to ban the regulation by both the federal and state governments of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives was a key turning point in the march toward the financial crisis. 
Yet, without any oversight, OTC derivatives rapidly spiraled out of control and out of sight, growing to $673 trillion in notional amount. 
OTC derivatives contributed to the crisis in three significant ways. 
CDS were sold to investors to protect against the default or decline in value of mortgage-related securities backed by risky loans. 
Second, CDS were essential to the creation of synthetic CDOs. 
They amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped spread them throughout the financial system. 
Synthetic CDOs created by Goldman referenced more than 3,400 mortgage securities, and 610 of them were referenced at least twice. 
The government ultimately committed more than $180 billion because of concerns that AIG’s collapse would trigger cascading losses throughout the global financial system. 
We conclude the failures of credit rating agencies were essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction. 
In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. 
From 2000 to 2007, Moody’s rated nearly 45,000 mortgage-related securities as triple-A. 
In 2006 alone, Moody’s put its triple-A stamp of approval on 30 mortgage-related securities every working day. 
You will also read about the forces at work behind the breakdowns at Moody’s, including the flawed computer models, the pressure from financial firms that paid for the ratings, the relentless drive for market share, the lack of resources to do the job despite record profits, and the absence of meaningful public oversight. 
THERE ARE MANY COMPETING VIEWS as to the causes of this crisis. 
Here we discuss three: capital availability and excess liquidity, the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs), and government housing policy. 
Low interest rates, widely available capital, and international investors seeking to put their money in real estate assets in the United States were prerequisites for the creation of a credit bubble. 
These government-sponsored enterprises had a deeply flawed business model as publicly traded corporations with the implicit backing of and subsidies from the federal government and with a public mission. 
In 2005 and 2006, they decided to ramp up their purchase and guarantee of risky mortgages, just as the housing market was peaking. 
They suffered from many of the same failures of corporate governance and risk management as the Commission discovered in other financial firms. 
We conclude that these two entities contributed to the crisis, but were not a primary cause. 
The GSEs participated in the expansion of subprime and other risky mortgages, but they followed rather than led Wall Street and other lenders in the rush for fool’s gold. 
Those purchases represented 10.5% of non-GSE subprime mortgage-backed securities in 2001, with the share rising to 40% in 2004, and falling back to 28% by 2008. 
For example, data compiled by the Commission for a subset of borrowers with similar credit scores--scores below 600--show that by the end of 2008, GSE mortgages were far less likely to be seriously delinquent than were non-GSE securitized mortgages: 6.2% versus 28.3%. 
Based on the evidence and interviews with dozens of individuals involved in this subject area, we determined these goals only contributed marginally to Fannie’s and Freddie’s participation in those mortgages. 
These policies were put in place and promoted by several administrations and Congresses—indeed, both Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. 
In conducting our inquiry, we took a careful look at HUD’s affordable housing goals, as noted above, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). 
The CRA requires banks and savings and loans to lend, invest, and provide services to the communities from which they take deposits, consistent with bank safety and soundness. 
Many subprime lenders were not subject to the CRA. 
Loans made by CRA-regulated lenders in the neighborhoods in which they were required to lend were half as likely to default as similar loans made in the same neighborhoods by independent mortgage originators not subject to the law. 
WHEN THIS COMMISSION began its work 18 months ago, some imagined that the events of 2008 and their consequences would be well behind us by the time we issued this report. 
Our financial system is, in many respects, still unchanged from what existed on the eve of the crisis. 
financial sector is now more concentrated than ever in the hands of a few large, systemically significant institutions. 
In our inquiry, we found dramatic breakdowns of corporate governance, profound lapses in regulatory oversight, and near fatal flaws in our financial system. 
These are serious matters that must be addressed and resolved to restore faith in our financial markets, to avoid the next crisis, and to rebuild a system of capital that provides the foundation for a new era of broadly shared prosperity. 
If we accept this notion, it will happen again. 
There is still much to learn, much to investigate, and much to fix. 
It falls to us to make different choices if we want different results. 
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, George A. 
Goldway, Vice Chairman Dana B. 
SUMMARY This report provides an analysis of the United States Postal Service's current legal authority to: (1) introduce and provide new products and services; and (2) enter into negotiated service agreements with individual customers. 
The Commission's analysis of existing postal law yields the following conclusions: • The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 gives the United States Postal Service a clear mandate to innovate by developing effective and efficient services adapted to the needs of the Nation's mail users. 
§§ 3623 through 3625. 
• Negotiated Service Agreements (NSAs) or "niche classifications" are rate and service adjustments arranged by the Postal Service and potential users that are legally permissible, provided that: ❶ The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding, as the Reorganization Act requires; ❷ The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole; and ❸ The negotiated rate-and-service package is made available on the same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same conditions of service. 
BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF ANALYSIS In joint deliberations on appropriations for the United States Postal Service and certain other agencies and departments for Fiscal Year 2002, the committee of conference directed both the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission to prepare reports on particular areas of the Postal Service's authority under existing law.1 Specifically, the conferees directed: …both the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission to independently report, 90 days after enactment of this Act, on the scope of existing authority of the US Postal Service, under title 39, United States Code, and title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, to introduce and provide new products and services (including the introduction and provision of new products and service on an experimental or market test basis) and to enter into negotiated service agreements with individual customers or groups of customers.

POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP, INTRODUCE AND PROVIDE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES A. 
Section 101(a) of Title 39 establishes the Postal Service's paramount obligation "to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people." The same section establishes the performance criterion that the Postal Service is expected to achieve as a matter of postal policy: "It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and .

in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date. 
39 U.S.C. 
The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. 
Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. 
MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976. 
Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so. 
Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service. 
Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests. 
The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments. 
§§ 3001.67 through .67d, provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing is required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment. 
The fourth set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time. 
The rules specify the limited information the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements. 
The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. 
See the Appendix to this report under the heading for Docket No. 
The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time.

A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character. 
The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling. 
Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation. 
The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years.

POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service. 
Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users. 
However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone. 
From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39. 
Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act. 
However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards. 
Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change.

Problematical "Contract Rates" In a rulemaking proceeding conducted in the late 1980s at the request of a mailer, the Commission addressed the question of the Postal Service's authority to negotiate rate changes in the form of a proposal to recognize "contract rates." After considering comments of the Postal Service and other participants, the Commission found the proposal problematical, and declined to pursue it. 
RM89-5, included two variants: 1. 
The Postal Service and one or more mailers would negotiate a rate and service package which would then (i) be submitted to the Commission for a review, and (ii) thereafter be available on the same terms to all potential users. 
The Postal Service commented that, in its view, legal constraints would not preclude a contract mechanism in principle, but that no such arrangement would be permissible without the Commission's participation in accordance with 39 U.S.C. 
Upon consideration of the initial comments it received, the Commission declined to pursue the contract rate proposal, but solicited further comments on several broad issues concerning possible changes in the mail classification system. 
It also raised the potential problems of unreasonable discrimination that such contracts might cause, in contravention of 39 U.S.C. 
Negotiated Service Agreements and Specialized "Niche Classifications" Following publication of the report of the joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force on ratemaking, the Postal Service petitioned the Commission to adopt rules to implement some of the report's recommendations. 
Reg. 
However, the Commission also expressed a general willingness to address the concept in a subsequent rulemaking. 
These procedures have been shown to be well suited to the consideration of "niche classification" proposals. 
For example, the Commission approved a two-year experiment of a program that enabled users of bulk, nonletter-size Business Reply Mail such as photofinishers that could reliably determine postage and fees due, to obtain earlier access to their mail at revised fees.15 The Commission subsequently granted a requested extension of the experiment,16 and ultimately approved a request to make the experimental program a permanent mail classification.17 More recently, in Docket No.

Postal Service withdrew request on November 5, 2001 because the disruption of other events made conducting the experiment inadvisable. 
LSC management prides itself on thorough and effective monitoring of recipient activities and on its training of recipients with regard to compliance issues. 
Congress has mandated that LSC effectively monitor and audit its grant recipients, and that LSC respect attorney-client privilege and ensure that LSC recipients carry out their work consistent with their professional responsibilities. 
The Protocol is intended to set forth LSC's policy with respect to accessing grant recipients' files and to facilitate better communication and understanding on this topic. 
ACCESS TO RECORDS April 25, 2002 This document sets forth procedures to be used by LSC's Office of Compliance and Enforcement (OCE) and Office of Program Performance (OPP) when making requests to review documents that contain information about clients and their cases that may be protected from disclosure to LSC by the attorney-client privilege or the rules of professional responsibility. 
See Section 1006(b)(1)(A). 
However, the LSC Act recognizes that some records contain information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or attorney's ethical responsibilities under rules of professional responsibility. 
Legal Services of New York City, 249 F.3d 1077 (D.C. 
2001). 
PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to inform LSC recipients and other interested parties of the procedure for providing LSC access to records in a manner consistent with the attorney-client privilege and applicable rules of professional responsibility and the mechanism to resolve issues of how such access can be obtained. 
In addition, upon request, recipients must also provide LSC access to original unredacted client "statement of facts," as required by 45 CFR §1636. 
PROCEDURES 1. 
Such information will hereafter be referred to as privileged or confidential information. 
2. 
Each review is an ongoing process that may expand based on information reviewed. 
3. 
During on-site visits, OCE will affirmatively encourage recipients to use such intermediaries and will not request direct access to or control over client case files or any other records containing privileged or confidential information. 
Flexibility of Approaches: OCE shall consider and seek to accommodate reasonable approaches to access to records proposed by recipients to protect privileged or confidential information so long as such proposed approaches also ensure access by OCE to information it needs to carry out its responsibilities. 
5. 
A recipient shall notify OCE under the procedures set forth in section 7 below, that the information sought is, in the recipient's view, protected by the attorney-client privilege. 
Procedures for Addressing Privileged or Confidential Information: If a recipient believes that documents or information requested by OCE contain information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege, applicable rules of professional responsibility or other law, the recipient will send written notice to OCE as soon as possible setting forth (1) a full description of the nature of the privileged or confidential information, (2) a statement explaining the basis for determining that such information is privileged or confidential, and (3) any recommendations of reasonable approaches to accessing such information. 
If OCE is not able to expediently resolve all outstanding issues of concern, it will, through the Vice President for Administration, promptly so advise LSC's President and the Vice Presidents for Programs, Legal Affairs and Government Relations of the access issues raised and the specific reasons why the proposed alternative methods of access are inadequate. 
8. 
The Vice President for Programs will review the recommendation and make further inquiry as appropriate. 
If the Vice President for Programs determines that LSC should proceed to take action affecting the recipient, it shall notify the recipient in writing of the action that is proposed. 
However, if the action involves a sanction or adverse action other than termination or suspension, then LSC may, and is encouraged to, allow a recipient an opportunity to further present it's position. 
The recipient would be given an opportunity to request a meeting with the Vice President for Programs to ask for reconsideration of the proposed action. 
As soon thereafter as is practical, the Vice President for Programs would notify the recipient in writing of the recommendation to the President and the reasons therefore. 
The recipient would be given the opportunity to provide such additional written information as it believes will assist the President to fully and fairly consider its concerns and objections. 
As soon thereafter as practical, the LSC President would advise the recipient of the final decision and reasons therefore. 
9. 
10. 
These procedures do not create new rights or obligations for LSC or LSC recipients and may be modified by the LSC President as warranted, with appropriate notice to the Board and field programs.

READ ON........ 
A couple in Sweetwater, Texas had a lot of potted plants, and during a recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze. 
She let out a very loud scream. 
She told him there was a snake under the sofa. 
About that time the family dog came and cold-nosed him on the leg. 
His wife thought he had a heart attack, so she called an ambulance. 
About that time the snake came out from under the sofa and the Emergency Medical Technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher. 
The wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor man. 
He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch. 
But in relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions, where she felt the snake wriggling around. 
The neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches. 
The noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed he had been bitten by the snake. 
They were about to arrest them all, when the two women tried to explain how it all happened over a little green snake. 
He missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table that was on one side of the sofa. 
The other policeman tried to beat out the flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog, who startled, jumped up and raced out into the street, where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car and set it on fire. 
Time passed... 
The husband asked his wife if she thought they should bring in their plants for the night. 
Sadie: I know what I need, write for me please the prescription. 
Sadie: I feel wonderful.

am a bricklayer by trade. 
When I completed my work, I found I had some bricks left over, which, when weighed later, were found to be slightly in excess of 500lbs. 
Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, I swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. 
You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135lbs. 
Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. 
This explains the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3 of the accident report form. 
Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience. 
Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. 
As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building. 
This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body. 
The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.

They will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense is noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact--and an additional two points on days when the news organization runs a follow-up without making note of said inconvenient fact. 
Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness of Joseph Stalin. 
But Chatterbox doesn't know any other easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of offense.) For the purposes of this survey, the Wall Street Journal will be counted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal 's editorial page, because, in essence, it is. 
Bill Clinton. 
And because it published an editorial Feb. 
That comes to a total of six . 
Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus points for having "eventually convinced" Broaddrick to grant an interview to the New York Times (as the Times reports in today's story). 
And besides, Rabinowitz's efforts on the Times ' behalf weren't really unethical, just puzzling, given the two newspapers' intense rivalry. 
"Ms. 
"I asked her why she had decided to talk to the New York Post 's Steve Dunleavy, and refused a Times reporter. 
She asked if I thought it would be all right to talk to the Times reporter.

Husbands and Wives Chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext (and hence much of the appeal) of a Hillary Clinton-Rudy Giuliani Senate race would be Wronged Wife vs. 
By running against Giuliani (who has been reported in Vanity Fair to have a mistress--he denies it--and, by all accounts, has a sham marriage), the first lady could exact symbolic revenge on her philandering husband while advancing the fortunes of the Democratic party at the same time! 
The last thing he needs is to draw more attention to these qualities in his personal life. 
Hanover "would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate, whether she would like him to run for Senate, or whether she would campaign for him if he did. 
Clinton is a 'very interesting' person. 
Hanover plans to be Hillary Clinton's campaign manager? 
This diminishes-- slightly-- the significance of Norma Kelsey's possible motives in verifying parts of Broaddrick's story. 
Bill Clinton, and remains perplexed that the Journal editorial page won't. 
The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna Dear Joe, I know what you mean about being a journalist. 
I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes, so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need. 
Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories. 
Much of it, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some very good stories. 
I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man--at AOL, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other "characters," for lack of a better word. 
That's ironic, since I think it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley. 
I wonder if that means geography is destiny, and it's still location, location, location. 
I think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it's clear that the balance of power is shifting again, although it not clear where it will land. 
Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate? 
That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire's grip on humanity.

But USA Today stays with Princess Di. 
The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about whether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon, dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was ambushed, with twelve deaths the result.

Much of the continuing Diana coverage is spinning off into the realm of meta- and meta-meta-pieces. 
But USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces as well. 
Salvation--hers and that of the destitute she rescued from the gutters--was her aim, not economic or social development as many others understand it, she said." It's odd, however, that in repeating this charge, the Times didn't interview the man most closely associated with it, Christopher Hitchens, or refer to the book where he set it out, The Missionary Position . 
Doesn't that sound like celebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory? 
Given that Ms. 
Fashioning Paula USA Today leads with Texas' settlement of its product-liability lawsuit against the leading tobacco companies.

That makes Texas the third state to settle such a case, joining Florida and Mississippi.

Stephanopoulos Analyzes His Own Crime There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week this morning, furrow-browed and "heartbroken with all the evidence coming out" against the president. 
could lead to impeachment proceedings." Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even disgusting about Stephanopoulos' eager show of independence from the president? 
Political figures turn on each other from time to time, for good and bad reasons; we're used to it. 
During the 1992 campaign, when Gennifer Flowers first brought Clinton's philandering to public attention, Stephanopoulos--as Clinton's chief spinner, distracter, and all-around bullshit artist--played a crucial role in discrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth, namely that Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem. 
Again, he's not a fool.) Simply put, Stephanopoulos did as much as any man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments. 
Early in the film, with the Flowers crisis in full bloom, Sam Donaldson interviews Stephanopoulos, who blames it all on the "Republican attack machine." "Gov. 
Donaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted to infidelity. 
(Today, of course, the president's defenders claim that Clinton admitted infidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply didn't care.) Near the end of The War Room, Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours, which he is about to publicize. 
"You would be laughed at ..." he tells the caller. 
... 
He was one of Clinton's principal enablers, to use a word employed by Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times . 
Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst. 
Joe McCarthy, without any apology for his own role. 
But usually at least a nanosecond of contrition is required. 
If Clinton, as is now increasingly clear, was a time bomb waiting to explode, then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House and muffled the ticking. 
Jewish settlement in Palestine, then part of the decaying Ottoman Empire, only proceeded piecemeal. 
Most integrated into multiethnic communities in the cities of Jaffa, Tiberias, and Jerusalem. 
Extolling the virtues of manual labor, they acquired huge tracts of farmland from absentee Syrian and Lebanese landlords. 
The Jewish National Fund was founded in 1904 for the purpose of buying up land from Arabs. 
In anticipation, Jews in Palestine began laying the groundwork for a greater sense of national identity. 
Following Jewish National Fund guidelines, farmers evicted Palestinian peasants living on the newly acquired plots. 
By 1946, Jews owned only 7 percent of Palestine, but the perceived threat of displacement was widespread among Arabs. 
Among the peasantry, rumors spread alleging an Anglo-Jewish conspiracy to remove Muslims from Palestine. 
They publicly supported Arab complaints that Jews were driving Arabs off the land. 
During the 1930s, Palestinian responses turned violent . 
Arabs, who outnumbered Jews by more than 2-to-1, revolted against Jewish land acquisition and British promises of Jewish nationhood. 
Zionists argued that the land purchases benefited all the territory's residents. 
Zionists also maintain that Jews became a lucrative market for Arab-manufactured goods. 
Urban commerce drew some peasants from their family farms. 
Jewish land purchases were not the primary factor, these historians say. 
Jewish sovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are: by war. 
Property owned by Arab refugees, who either fled war zones or were forced from their homes by the Israeli army (another long-standing controversy), was also taken over by individual Jews or confiscated by the government. 
A new school of Jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused by Jewish land acquisition, and concludes that it was not always fair. 
Others argue that it was a mistake for the Jewish National Fund to prohibit non-Jewish laborers from the newly purchased lands. 
In the past, death threats have done little to deter sales of land. 
But that decree did not have the power of civil law behind it. 
Fetal Viability "Viability" has become the focus of the abortion debate. 
How is the concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal issues of abortion? 
Wade , the 1973 case legalizing abortion, made fetal viability an important legal concept . 
It said this included fetuses that doctors expected to be sustained by respirators. 
Because the point of viability varies, the court ruled, it could only be determined case by case and by the woman's own doctor. 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued in a 1983 decision that Roe was on a "collision course with itself." She said that improvements in technology would continually push the point of fetal viability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy, allowing states greater opportunity to regulate the right to an abortion. 
Doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the 23 rd week--a week earlier than was thought 24 years ago. 
Their lungs have barely formed and their airways are not developed enough to inhale. 
A baby born during the 22 nd week has a 14.8 percent chance of survival. 
Neonatologists predict that no baby will ever be viable before the 22 nd week, because before then the lungs are not fully formed. 
By the 30 th week, when a newborn doesn't require a ventilator to breathe, it has a 90 percent chance of survival. 
Because premature babies depend on technology, survival rates vary based on access to that technology . 
Doctors assess a fetus's viability by attempting to guess whether its lungs have formed. 
None of the methods for predicting viability are very precise. 
The only significant revision came in the Casey decision (1992), which made viability even more important. 
Some require doctors to perform tests to prove a fetus is pre-viable and require multiple doctors to certify the findings. 
Banning IDEs nationwide is a major goal of the pro-life movement. 
Barring this procedure is also the only regulation of abortion that public-opinion polls say has a majority of support. 
Some medical ethicists and constitutional scholars say that the Supreme Court was wrong to create the pre-viability/post-viability distinction in the first place. 
In 1992, only 1,070 abortions were performed after the 25 th week.

Many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from the pure-minded use of a word that suggests unmentionable parts of the human body.

In Forster's A Passage to India (Chapter XXXI) a vivid picture is created by the sentence “Tangles like this still interrupted their intercourse.” Pages later (Chapter XXXVII), it is acknowledged that “He, too, felt that this was their last free intercourse.” Apparently from then on, it was going to have to be cash or credit card only. 
For in Paris they told the elf Our rough North land was the Land of Lays, even though it is generally acknowledged that Paris is número uno in this area of human activity. 
An arresting one occurs in A Passage to India (Chapter XXI) in which Forster describes a small building as “a flimsy and frivolous erection,” while in The Mayor of Casterbridge (Chapter XVI) the Mayor himself “beheld the unattractive exterior of Farfrae's erection.” A phrase can paint an astonishing picture for the reader. 
” Or, in Nicholas Nickleby (Chapter XLVII), where that admirable novelist graphically portrays how old Arthur Gride “again raised his hands, again chuckled, and again ejaculated.” And in his short tale, Lionizing , Edgar Allan Poe is quite candid in describing the reaction of one of his characters: “ ` Admirable! 
Earlier in this century, pansy became a derogatory epithet to describe an effete male, thereby cheapening forever lines like Shelley's noble image in Adonais (verse XXXIII): His head was bound with pansies over-blown, not to mention Poe's odd allusion in For Annie : With rue and the beautiful Puritan pansies.

Submitted by .] LIGHT REFRACTIONS If you are a fan of old-fashioned jazz—what is now known as “traditional” or “trad” jazz—you are familiar with one of the standard “jump tunes” of the genre—a tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble . 
Dah! 
da-dat-dat-dah! 
da-de-da-de-da-de-dat-dat-dah!” That's it; sure; you've heard it. 
My memory is rickety, but I am sure my first recording was labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE, and I think, though I am less sure, that it was played by the late “Muggsy” Spanier, who was, to my mind, one of the greatest of jazz trumpeters. 
The label said, MUSKAT RAMBLE. 
(This, remember, was in my youth, and it was a time when typographical errors were called typographical errors, not typos—at least by kids in junior high.) Some time later, I got still another version of MUSKRAT RAMBLE, with still another version of the title. 
That, I thought, was really absurd. 
I looked up muscat in my Webster's and found that it is a `variety of grape.' To name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous. 
During my time in senior high, and, after that, in the Army Air Force, I had other things on my mind (there was a war on, after all), and I didn't give the MUSKRAT-MUSKAT-MUSCAT RAMBLE problem any thought. 
Now might be as good a time as any to reveal a theft I committed at an Air Force Base near Seymour, Indiana. 
The wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with what seemed an absolute determination to crystallize our bodies. 
Usually the records were taken from their jackets and loaded naked in stacks, where they picked up dust, scratched one another, and traded static electricity. 
I played all three, and the few other G.I.s in the room, which was quite large—big enough for a fair-sized dance with a small orchestra—either paid no attention or asked me to put on something by Glenn Miller or Jimmy or Tommy Dorsey instead. 
and Goin' back to Black Mountain, me an' my razor an' my gun; Goin' back to Black Mountain, me an' my razor an my gun; Goin' cut him if he stan' still, goin' shoot him if he run. 
“Kid” Ory played great jazz trombone. 
About thirty years ago, when I was concocting an epicurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand, I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that I thought might be exactly right for my sauce. 
Muscatel is made from muscat grapes, is sometimes called muscat , and, being relatively cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content, is the booze of choice for a great many wines. 
I made up my mind that Muscat Ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune. 
Muskrats, according to my encyclopedia, look like giant rats, are found in and around the mudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds, have partially webbed feet, and do a good deal of swimming. 
Muscat, or muscatel, on the other hand, is found on skid rows all over the land. 
After the guy finishes his Napa Valley smoke and has slept it off, he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix. 
I suspect that that is precisely the song's origin. 
I asked him what he thought the original title was. 
I once asked Ory about it and he said, `It's m-u-s-c-a-t. 
I find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually. 
On the other hand, a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain his muscat level—now that has a touch of poetry.

Ten pages on (page 17), water occurs nine times but there are also the related words stream (twice), well (twice), pool, channel , and the circumlocution “essential element.” Two words, dew and shower , refer in the context to the presence of water; the rest are in contexts indicating its absence. 
Taking page 17 again, I was reminded that Giles is rather given to semi-serious poetic diction at times, and we find him referring to the presence of water in the Finke River as “the stream purling over its stony floor” or, quoting some bygone poet, “brightly the brook through the green leaflets, giddy with joyousness, dances along.” Perhaps present water called for some stylistic celebration. 
In addition, there was a rich collection of words relating to water, not necessarily indicating its presence. 
Even words which are usually of more general reference are brought into relation with water in a text like this. 
Apart from these words and lake , words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include pool, springs, drainage hole, clay hole, flood, channel, water-courses, water-hole, rock-hole, drink, drinkable, running water, stream , and native well . 
Stream is often said not to be used in Australia except in metaphorical ways, normally being replaced by creek . 
British-born explorers did not set out to write Australian English, of course. 
The other name, native well is, as a later explorer David Carnegie, author of Spinifex and Sand (1898), points out, a misnomer. 
This sort of misnomer leads Carnegie to suppose that “to the uninitiated no map is so misleading as that of West Australia where lakes are salt-bogs without surface water, springs seldom run, and native `wells' are merely tiny holes in the rock, yielding from 0 to 200 gallons.” Carnegie also describes namma-holes and soaks as sources of water. 
Perhaps these words did not really fit. 
Wadi , for instance, would describe an inland creek rather well. 
There is really no excuse, Fowler says (not he says!), but here we give examples of his third case only, where “there should not be two parties justifying even a momentary doubt about which the pronoun represents.” And here the deluge of printed matter abounds with such specimens that one would suppose them to be the rule rather than the exceptions. 
I am not picking on the following authors; it is just a random catch. 
Her suitor, Neigh, who had proposed marriage in a previous chapter, appears somewhat apprehensive at Ethelberta's suggestion. 
Belmaine and mistaken by him for an indication that Neigh has been dragged into going to the church against his will “by his over-hasty wife.” One wonders whether the marriage had secretly taken place between the consecutive chapters!

Nobody who knew him would have expected him to do anything else, whether he had been sent away in disgrace or not—but, as it was thought he had left the country, his return did have a dramatic quality. 
From Oh What a Paradise it Seems , by John Cheever: The size of Chisholm's teeth, the thickness of his glasses, his stoop and the spring with which he walked all marked him, Sears thought, as a single-minded reformer. 
No wonder — we've lost them already. 
He slipped the knife out of the sheath and was ready, and unembarrassed by hampering bedclothes, for the weather was hot and we hadn't any.

There is a quiet humor in Yiddish and a gratitude for every day of life, every crumb of success, each encounter of love. 
The word Yiddish derives from the German judisch `Jewish.' The principal parent of Yiddish is High German, the form of German encountered by Jewish settlers from northern France in the eleventh century. 
Journalist Charles Rappaport once quipped, “I speak ten languages—all of them Yiddish.” Although Yiddish has been in danger of dying out for hundreds of years, the language is spoken today by millions of people throughout the world—Russia, Poland, Rumania, France, England, Israel, Africa, Latin America, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the United States, where, like the bagel, it was leavened on both coasts, in New York and Hollywood. 
Quickly she holds up a cross. 
Translation: “It won't do you any good.” Most of us already speak a fair amount of Yiddish (Yinglish) without fully realizing it. 
and so on through the whole megillah : `long, involved story.' A number of poignant Yiddish words defy genuine translation into English: chutzpa `nerve; unmitigated gall;' a quality we admire within ourselves, but never in others. 
“Chutzpa is that quality enshrined in a man, who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan. 
Help!' while beating you up.” mensch a `real authentic human being—a person.' naches the `glow of pleasure-plus-pride that only a child can give to its parents': “This is my son, the Doctor!” oy not so much a word as an entire vocabulary, as Rosten observes: “can express any emotion, from trivial delight to the blackest woe.” oy vay; oy vay in mir literally, “Oh, pain,” but, in its long or short form, can be used for anything from condolence to lament: On August 6, 1945, the world's first nuclear weapon was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. 
(And the nebbish is the one who has to clean it up.) The Yiddish language, through its color, its target-accurate expressions, its raw idioms, and its sayings exudes a refreshing magic and laughter, mixed with sober thought, that has been handed down from generation to generation and from nation to nation. 
Which reminds us of the zaftig `buxom, well-rounded' blonde who wore an enormous diamond to a charity ball. 
“Nothing in life is all mazel [`good luck']. 
The Women's History of the Word Those who are not familiar with feminist writings may find it useful and interesting to consider a book, recently published in Britain, that is typical of the harsher brand of such works. 
Men are seldom assigned to review them, possibly because the editor fears that they will be either ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised, if not biased against them, or because the editor is a woman. 
According to the blurb on the dust jacket of this distinctly unpleasant book, Rosalind Miles is head of the Centre for Women's Studies at Coventry Polytechnic, a lecturer, broadcaster, journalist, and author of several other books, including a “highly acclaimed” biography of Ben Jonson. 
At one point, she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of counting (in order to keep track of menstruation) and, probably by the same token, astronomy. 
In the good old days, we were taught that the pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves. 
— ordinary laborers. 
bound in fetters, they work continually without being allowed any rest by night or day. 
It is even less comprehensible how a modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery to promulgate it. 
Women have always commanded over half the sum total of human intelligence and creativity. 
In every field, women too numerous to list were involved in developing knowledge and contributing to the welfare of their societies as they did so: the Roman Fabiola established a hospital where she worked both as nurse and doctor, becoming the first known woman surgeon before she died in AD 399. 
Clearly, this rosily checkered past was soon to be replaced, chiefly, it seems, as Judeo-Christian-Islamic-Confucian-Buddhist cultures flourished. 
As a final stroke, in a grim foreshadowing of what the future held in store for the Jews, the niddah had to wear special clothing as a badge of her separate and despised status. 
According to Campbell, the only godlike female figure in the Bible is the Virgin Mary, and she appears, identified as virgin, only in the Gospel according to Luke. 
Although this might help explain the Judeo-Christian-Muslim tendencies to subjugate women, treating them essentially as chattel, it does not account for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures, notably that of Japan. 
as they once existed, conceptually, for it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering to those religous precepts. 
With all respect, that seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex for this discussion, though we can certainly trace a diminution in the role of female divinities (or divinity) when we come to examine Judaism and its congeners and progeny. 
If there is something wrong, it behooves us to get at the roots of the problem, not to flail about wildly, for only after the source of a disease has been identified can one properly investigate its cure. 
In this jeremiad, males are viewed as the “enemy,” and are so characterized throughout the book, which concludes with exhortations to engage the foe and a strident call to arms (though not men's). 
Most of the relies from the past are gone forever, destroyed by the plows of countless generations of farmers, reduced to rubble by erosion, by conquerors, by prehistoric (and modern) urban developers, by fire and flood, and just by time. 
The interest in man's forebears did not become fashionable upon the publication, a few years ago, of Roots : on a far larger scale, we have been trying to discover all we can about the origins not of men but of man. 
Perhaps the fascination with man's past grew out of the obsession with ruins evinced by Romanticism; certainly, modern archaeology seems to have followed close behind, for the excavation of the supposed site of Troy took place only about 100 years ago. 
Archaeology is a popular pursuit, and its manifest results not only receive considerable publicity but can be seen in museums. 
Even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing system are relatively sparse: Classical Latin and Greek, Hebrew, and a few other languages are better documented than others; but for most all we have to go on are a handful of tablets here, a few inscriptions there, barely enough in many cases to allow us to identify the language, let alone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning. 
About languages that had no writing system, we know nothing at all. 
Another significant break-through was that of Michael Ventris (1922-1956), who deciphered the Linear B script found on Crete and identified it as an early form of Greek. 
Many years ago, a linguistic scholar counted all of the languages then spoken of which he had evidence. 
The exact count is unimportant and, at best, spurious, for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for what distinguishes dialect from language. 
Linguists examining Classical Greek, Latin, German, English, Slavic, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Lithuanian, Iranian, Hindi, and the other languages of India and Europe found that there were correspondences among many of the common words. 
One rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes, for after years of laboriously categorizing these languages, the number of different main branches (called families and subfamilies) came to about ten. 
Although certain other languages were geographically nearby, it was impossible to establish any resemblances between them, hence Basque, for example, is not classified as being in the same family with other European languages, nor are Hungarian and Finnish, both of which belong to their own group. 
The languages discussed here are what are usually called the Indo-European family; similar family trees could be drawn for the Semitic languages, Sino-Tibetan, Japanese, Bantu, Malayo-Polynesian, and so on. 
It is important, too, to note that writing systems are irrelevant: for instance, Polish is written (today) using the Roman alphabet, but Russian, a related Slavic language, uses the Cyrillic; Yiddish, a Germanic language, is written in Hebrew characters; Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit, which resemble one another rather closely in some respects, all use different alphabets; and early examples, utterly unrecognizable to untrained readers of modern languages, were written in cuneiform, quite suitable for writing on soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus, and hieroglyphics. 
But only rarely did they collaborate and, with few exceptions, their work was not correlated in a systematic way. 
In many other places, the ancient sites lay buried—and still do—beneath modern cities: modern property owners quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down their buildings on the off chance that the remnants of an ancient town will be found several yards below. 
But there, as everywhere else, nothing can interfere with progress and, regardless of the finds and their importance, the archaeologist must eventually yield to the bulldozer. 
Based on the sparse evidence available, linguists theorized about the earlier languages that had given rise to those attested. 
In most cases, they dealt with words and functional elements, creating what are called reconstructions in hypothetical family prototypes called, variously, Proto-Latin, Proto-Greek, Proto-Germanic, Proto-Indo-Iranian, and so forth, the ultimate goal being to posit a single language called Proto-Indo-European. 
Nonetheless, it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of proto-dialects which can be referred to as Proto-Indo-European. 
I have no quarrel with Renfrew's theory—notwithstanding the generally received wisdom that has placed the homeland north of the Black Sea region and the Volga steppes. 
Using the evidence available, Renfrew contends that the original Indo-European language, closely related to Hittite, separated after 6500 BC, with the IE languages of western Europe developing from western Anatolia and those of Iran, India, and Pakistan from the eastern division. 
Pottery finds can be interpreted to support either the imposition of an elite culture from Turkmenia or a late development of the Indus civilization. 
Unfortunately, the presentation of his linguistic argument, where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology, where he is on more familiar territory, is disorganized and repetitious. 
The result is an argument that is persuasive but scarely convincing. 
Only one thing made me a little suspicious when cranking up the system: in the descriptive text that appears on the screen, the word labeled is spelt “labelled”—decidedly un-American. 
I looked up the word preceding and was, after a brief moment, asked to type in the word, which I did. 
I am not sure why, but I expected the program to “network” in the same way. 
If all this is too complicated to follow, let me summarize: you look up word X and get synonyms A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. 
Even the definition provided for the sub-listings is identical in wording to that of the word originally sought. 
If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary is likely to be of use, then this package may be of service. 
(That was the number listed when I received my copy; it might have increased.) It also has a few neat features, like suggesting a few alternatives if you happen to think that preceding is spelt “preceeding” (as many people do). 
Also, if you enter jump , you get the synonyms for that; but if you enter jumped , you get the (same) synonyms but inflected—including the variants leapt, leaped for leap .

I, No. 
The article is a classic, probably the first on the subject to appear in a scholarly journal, though there are other informal references to family language, some of which are documented by Dickson in his Bibliography. 
Some are quite unique and their reporters cannot imagine their origin; others, like Penn Station , “what one family terms a child's misinterpretation of a famous line or phrase,” are clear: the generic term comes from the Lord's Prayer—“And lead us not into Penn Station.” Obviously, that works only for kids familiar with New York City.

Inevitably, some of the entries are more imaginative than others; Dickson will have his hands full if everyone responds giving private words. 
Laurence Urdang A Midwesterner, Will Hays, Jr., who is proud of his knowledge of post-Civil-War history, tells me the following origin of shot , as in shotglass , absent from “Gunning for the English Language”: Although we associate trench warfare with World War I, trenches were characteristic also of the Civil War. 
The soldier in charge would command, after each firing, that the rank on the scaffold step down and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded, thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire. 
They moved westward to start a new life. 
Most new saloons were small and the bars short, accommodating with difficulty the many bunched up, in ranks, if you will, calling for whiskey. 
Thus, “Step down (or back) and give me a shot” was readily understood.

The monkey on board ship was a lad employed to fetch supplies—powder and so forth—to the guns. 
So what is the explanation of the phrase cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey ? 
Anybody who asks “Why a brass monkey?” is probably not aware that brass monkeys were very common household ornaments in England in the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
They can still be found today in so-called “gift shops.” Usually, they come in sets of three, one with its hands over its eyes, one over its ears, and one over its mouth: they were said to represent “See no evil, Hear no evil, Speak no evil.” There were various whimsical variants. 
The main problems are representing consonant clusters and word-final consonants. 
Every Japan veteran has his list of favorite mistakes. 
Adding the Japanese final vowels produces Gone with the Windo . 
This process resulted in the sign reading Pizz and Coffee . 
Japanese has a verb inflection which expresses causation or permission—in English, “to make someone or to let someone do something.” One day during a university English class, a very discomfited student, after frantic and obtrusive dictionary work, handed a colleague of mine a scrap of paper. 
Those familiar with Safire's editorial style, reflected in his political columns on the editorial pages of The N. 
Times , may agree with me in the contention that when he writes about language he seems to be writing on his day off: I cannot put my finger on why, but “On Language” always strikes me as an excruciating effort to be cute. 
More often than it might prove of interest to me, personally, Safire deals with insiders' language in Washington (where he is based) or with trivialities uttered by some politico. 
It ill behooves me, excoriated recently as enamored of the “cheap larf,” to criticize Safire's arch puns, which permeate—“enliven” is probably the word his editor would use—his articles, but I find some kinds of humor unsuitable for reading, however they might evoke a chuckle when uttered viva voce .

The publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from which this review was prepared; unfortunately, there was no proof of an index, but the publisher has assured me that there will be one in the published book, a rather essential ingredient of a work with this title. 
It has some problems, if you want to be sticky about things: on p. 
Indeed it does not. 
While I acknowledge that it is not easy to know how to sort out the many topics to be covered in a usage book, most reasonable writers have taken a stab at writing an entry under a heading that seems a likely place to look, then have provided a detailed index. 
True, one can find different from , etc., in an entry so headed, but for absolute constructions one is referred to an entry called “Covered with onions, relish, and ketchup, I ate a hotdog at the ball-park.” If the user wants to find out about misplaced adjectives and adverbs , reference is made to the entry “Electric shaver for women with delicate floral design on the handle.” A search for only would be futile. 
Fun is fun, but those who might rely on such a book are quite serious about the information they are seeking, and it is unfair to play fast and loose with their sincerity. 
And of what use are the interminable examples, for instance, of the misuse of like for as , which draw out the entry to three pages? 
The article on British/American English (“There's no home like Eaton Place.”) is a good one, but, at six pages, its utility is questionable. 
Of what relevance (to usage, notwithstanding the fact that the topic is interesting) is an entry on eponyms (“John Bull and John Hancock are not just any johns.”)? 
A longish section, “Some Troublesome Idiomatic Prepositions,” and a “Glossary of Grammatical and Linguistic Terms Used in This Book,” followed by a list of “References,” sources associated with specific entries, round out the work. 
Examples of franglais which they find particularly monstrous are, I hear, to be condemned to a newly created “Musée des horreurs.” The first is “sponsor, sponsoriser, sponsorisation.” The academy also calls upon all French to send in further examples of “linguistic pollution,” observing ruefully that this is one museum which will be open 12 months a year.

[From The Times , 16 May 1988] Loose Cannons & Red Herrings Readers should be familiar with Robert Claiborne's earlier books, especially Our Marvelous Native Tongue: The Life and Times of the English Language . 
The rationale behind referring to them as “lost” arises from the author's observation of an unfortunate state of affairs: because of an increasingly widespread lack of familiarity with the basic, structural elements of our culture—Greek and Roman mythology, the Bible, literature, and ordinary historical fact—people today are unable to discern the origins of terms like aphrodisiac, Achilles [sic] heel or tendon, meet one's Waterloo, sow dragon's teeth , and hand-writing on the wall , to name a few. 
In many entries, Claiborne labors the obvious, offering little or nothing we do not already know, could easily imagine, or for which the author offers no explanation. 
Examples of the last include spill the beans, square the circle, stalemate , etc. 
As for stalemate , which is related to checkmate , would it not have been important to indicate that the - mate part has nothing to do with English, having been borrowed from checkmate which is a loanword from Persian (and has nothing to do with check , either). 
Does any reader need an entry like this one? 
Some speculative suggestions, as the derivation (or reinforcement) from Seidlitz powders for take a powder are sheer nonsense. 
Most prominent among its earliest practitioners in England was Joseph Wright, who prepared the six-volume English Dialect Dictionary , which was published between 1898 and 1905; the best-known contemporary British specialist is Harold Orton. 
People generally seem to find dialect study interesting.

Map 33 shows the distribution of child (most of southern England) and of bairn (north of a slightly wavy line between Boston, on the Wash to the east, and Lancaster, on the west coast). 
The maps are clear, each occupying a full page, and the word information is well set forth on them. 
I have only one nit to pick with the authors. 
Although it is true that isoglosses, in effect, set off the various areas where a particular usage was recorded, more accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites either where speakers employ both usages or where speakers using one or the other live in very close proximity. 
Isoglosses are to dialect maps what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps, what isobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans, etc. 
In some respects, it may not be long before certain aspects of dialect geography will be largely historical. 
This book is a good introduction to the subject (in England); those familiar with dialectology in America, and those interested in the study in England or, indeed, generally would be well advised to add Word Maps to their libraries. 
It is divided into eighteen chapters varying in length, each dealing with a different aspect of the authors and their works, among them, Writers Related to Writers Schooldays (which colleges and universities spawned which writers) American Literary Pseudonyms American Literary Title Sources Literary Cons: Hoaxes, Frauds, and Plagiarism in American Literature The Profession of Authorship: Authors/Publishers/ Editors/Agents Thrown to the Wolves: Reviews and Reviewers These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography and a detailed Index. 
It is not at once apparent why the book is styled an “almanac,” but that is unimportant: there is no other book I know of that contains as much diverse information about American writers as this one. 
It contains many photographs of writers, some quite early; these enliven the appearance of the book but accomplish little else, unless one is interested in what Samuel Clemens looked like at the age of 15 (as a printer's devil) or in the appearance of Hart Crane standing in the middle of a railroad track in Cleveland in 1916. 
A handful might have led colorful existences, some are objects of interest because they died early, committed suicide, were related to (other) famous people, and so forth; but such information seldom reveals as much about their output as do the creations themselves, and in certain cases one is probably better off not knowing quite so much. 
Submitted by .] I would like to make a couple of comments on articles in the Autumn 1988 issue [XV,2].

Michael was born with cerebral palsy. 
For 18 long months Michael could not find a job. 
Finally, Michael called Goodwill. 
After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person for the job. 
Every year, thousands of people come to Goodwill. 
Last year, participants in Goodwill programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $3.5 million. 
The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents, however.

For every dollar of public support Goodwill received last year, we returned $1.59 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments. 
While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea, the people who need jobs are floundering. 
Welfare is not the answer. 
Goodwill works.

Jerry's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately. 
The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended, and he returned to Career Academy for help once more. 
It took some time and hard work, but with the help of Goodwill, Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor's office, find housing and conduct a more thorough job search. 
Of the more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999, over 5,000 of them have multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job. 
Some are blind, deaf or have other physical disabilities. 
But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to overcome, like Jerry. 
For as long as he needs it, Goodwill will continue to help. 
And, with your assistance, Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job. 
Your generosity will help people help themselves.

Older kids, like Tracy and Kerry, left homeless after a recent murder-suicide in Indianapolis claimed Mom and Dad. 
Real people! 
Families are being torn apart, and too often, children are the victims. 
Pleasant Run Children's Homes began serving children nearly 130 years ago. 
For others, "families" are the counselors are housemates at the group homes where they live. 
In 1994 Pleasant Run served 346 children and 125 families.

For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families, we need your support. 
Please "help good kids get better" by sending us a contribution today. 
June 26, 1995 Dear Friend: This is not newsletter. 
In spite of that, Pleasant Run Children's Homes, with the help of hundreds of volunteers and others who really care, continues to make a significant impact on the futures of families and kids in need of help. 
Yet few of us hear enough about kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade. 
These are special children. 
They leave Pleasant Run, generally, ready and able to contribute to society. 
We are a not-for-profit, multi-service agency. 
Dear Friends of Pleasant Run: The holiday season is the time of year when we're all busy buying gifts, baking goodies, decorating our homes and making arrangements to be with family and friends. 
And this time of year is an occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are. 
We do this through a wide range of programs including community- based, therapeutic foster care, group homes and our treatment center. 
Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a contribution to Pleasant Run to help the 1,500 children families we care for. 
Others are from families that are struggling to provide a healthy, happy environment but don't have the resources to make it possible. 
It may help a family stay together. 
A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have presents to open. 
Your gift will go beyond the holiday season. 
Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run. 
We wish you and your family a new year full of joy and love. 
Every year we seek companies, organizations and individuals to sponsor one or more of our families. 
We meet these needs immediately. 
They do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a holiday meal. 
Thank you for considering this opportunity to make this a memorable holiday season for a family in need. 
Yes, it's that time of the year -- the start of the Boys & Girls clubs of Indianapolis' Camp. 
A time for a youngster to enjoy the fun and benefits of residential camp living, dedicated staff and instruction, and a chance to make special friends. 
That's why I want you to learn more about the Super Summer Safari Camp. 
It costs $225 to send one child to camp. 
Please make camp possible for all deserving Indianapolis children and send in a tax deductible contribution today in the enclosed envelope. 
No matter the size of the donation, please know that your gift will be appreciated and make a difference. 
You can make a difference in a child's life.

In 1998, we served a total of 31,484 low-income individuals through job training and placement assistance, youth and senior programming, family counseling, emergency assistance, and much more. 
The centers that serve these areas, Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, Hawthorne Community Center, Southwest Multi-Service Center, and Christamore House, have teamed up to run an exciting job readiness program for 14 and 15 year old area residents called the Summer Enrichment Program. 
The end result will be kids who have a better understanding of and vision for their own future, be it college or a career. 
We would like to offer our youth a small reward for their participation by presenting them with gift certificates from Target. 
In return, we will recognize Target as a sponsor during our event and in the event program.

August 4, 1999 Name Address City, ST Zip The goal of MCCOY, Inc. 
In 1998, MCCOY, Inc. 
Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified three goals for all our youth to obtain: economic self-sufficiency, healthy family, social relationships, and involvement in the community. 
One group of adults and one group of youth, through two very different processes, have arrived at the same conclusion; our community still has much to do if we are to help ALL of your youth successfully develop into the responsible, productive adults who will our community in the future. 
One, IndyGo in April adopted a much-needed policy that all young people under the age of 19 may ride on their buses at half the normal fare all year long. 
Through the youth mapping process, it was confirmed that the positive opportunities for youth on weekend evenings were lacking. 
As it has been an exciting year for all of us, MCCOY, Inc. 
Annually, we ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis. 
If you have any questions or concerns at any time, please do not hesitate to call me at 921-1288. 
Brandon, President MCCOY, Inc. 
Its purpose is to encourage collaboration and cooperation between the various agencies, programs, and systems that serve our community's youth. 
I have enclosed a packet of information about MCCOY and its work as well as an application with various options for supporting the youth of our community. 
I will call you in a few weeks to discuss your level of interest. 
October 7, 1996 Name Address City, ST Zip Dear Name: In the summer of 1993, the Marion County Commission on Youth began what can best be described as a "new era" in its history. 
It retained, however, the same mission with which it had been charged from its inception: to serve as a catalyst for effective, coordinated, and collaborative service delivery to youth in our community. 
The formation of The Community Academy, a pilot project directed at expelled students from local school systems, has come about as a result of MCCOY's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response to a pressing issue. 
One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
Since its re-organization, MCCOY has established its unique niche within the community by refraining from direct service programming and focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs, and moving toward collaborative solutions. 
McCoy invites the support of The __ Company Foundation in the amount of $10,000.00 to support such activities as: ---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhood-based youth councils; ---- the promotion of youth employment opportunities; ---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery; ---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youth-adult relationships; ---- the development of community-wide supports for the positive growth of all Marion County young people. 
We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people can grow and develop well. 
In our fund raising efforts to date, we have received the support of local government, foundations, and corporations as well as the personal financial commitments of individual MCCOY Board members. 
Thanking you in advance for your support, we remain, Sincerely, John T.

"I was matched with my Big Sister in June of 1992. 
We go to movies, dinner, concerts, and other stuff like that, but I have also been able to participate in charity events and fundraiser type things. 
In 1998, Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many programs. 
Over 170 young people are still waiting for a mentor. 
Will you make a financial gift to Big Sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the guidance they need, that more young people stay in school, stay off drugs and make good choices? 
It will also be used to help maintain the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships, including volunteer orientation and training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff. 
Gifts of $100 or more will be matched thanks to a special 25th Anniversary $100,000 Challenge Grant and will be placed in the Growth For Girls Fund.

And who plans to commit such a mass bird killing? 
Department of Agriculture! 
Let me tell you exactly what’s at stake ... 
You see, the USDA found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for “experimental” activities. 
And if the death of two million birds doesn’t “prove” their theory -- and show a reduction in crop loss -- they’ll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year! 
Meanwhile,blackbirds aren’t the only birds threatened directly by the poison. 
including the Bobolink, Grasshopper Sparrow, Harris’ Sparrow and Le Conte’s Sparrow. 
Here’s what I need you to do, to make sure we prevail: First, I need you to sign and return your Petition to the U.S. 
I’ll forward your Petition, along with those from thousands of other Audubon members and supporters, urging the USDA to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds ... 
I can assure you that thousands of Audubon Petitions can make a difference -- just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago! 
to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase 50 years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment. 
And with a donation of $15 or more, you’ll receive a FREE Birdfeeder in appreciation for your concern. 
·Gain strict enforcement of wildlife laws. 
And Audubon will draw upon its century-long track record of highly effective conservation work to make a real difference in other key areas: Audubon protects birds.

And your support will help sustain our innovative Audubon Refuge Keepers program, and maintain our own network of more than 100 wildlife centers and sanctuaries. 
Wetlands are not only crucial to wildlife ... 
Your gift today will help us reach our goal to restore one million acres of irreplaceable wetlands. 
Teaching Americans --particularly young people -- how to become better stewards of our environment is one of the best investments that you and I can make for wildlife. 
And of course, your support will enable Audubon to stand ready to act whenever a wildlife crisis emerges --like the USDA’s bird poisoning proposal that I’m asking you to help us defeat today! 
First,sign and return your Petition to the Secretary of Agriculture immediately, to declare a firm and resounding “NO!” to the USDA’s bird poisoning plan. 
Thank you. 
And in thanks for your gift of $15 or more, you 11 receive a FREE Birdfeeder.

I’ve had a look at the magazine’s upcoming subjects and I can tell you the best is yet to come. 
There’s much more to membership than AUDUBON magazine! 
You’ll be supporting sanctuaries, field research, environmental education and legislation and many other vital efforts critical to the protection of wildlife and their habitats. 
By accepting my special invitation to join again, you’ll receive special invitations to our sanctuaries and Ecology Camps — and FREE ADMISSION to our Nature Centers. 
We simply can’t afford to lose you. 
On behalf of everyone here at the National Audubon Society, we look forward to saying, “Welcome back!” All of us are excited about sending you your magazine and membership materials. 
As an added gesture of appreciation, I’ll also send you our binoculars -- FREE -- with your permanent membership. 
running. 
This wolf will be running for its life! 
in order to land and immediately gun her down . 
This cruel, unethical wolf-hunting practice is called “same-day airborne land-and-shoot.” It was a total shock and surprise. 
Frankly, we never thought Alaska’s anti-wolf politicians would go this far. 
when wolves will be “can’t-miss” targets against Alaska’s snowy terrain. 
Defenders hopes to raise at least $100,000 to help Alaskans For Wildlife, a coalition of Alaska citizens, win a citizens’ ballot initiative this November. 
So today, I urge you to do these two things: FIRST: Sign the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to show our Alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on “same-day airborne land-and-shoot” wolf killing in Alaska; SECOND: Rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in November. 
Like you, the majority of Alaskans oppose same-day land-and-shoot wolf killing. 
And they didn’t listen to the recommendations of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, which opposed this legislation! 
the state agency that manages Alaska wildlife ... 
Before the 1996 ban on same-day land-and-shoot, as many as 400 wolves were killed in Alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice. 
So if we don’t act right now, Alaska’s snowy tundras will once again become bloody killing fields for wolves in America’s “Last Frontier.” Say “NO” to the barbaric practice of same-day airborne wolf killing. 
As I mentioned, this new same-day airborne land-and-shoot practice will start in September after the opening of hunting season and the first snow — and when wolves will be an easy target. 
Our well-funded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure. 
A loss will encourage those anti-wolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in the wild. 
Please sign your Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to demonstrate to our Alaska allies that you’re behind them; and send an urgent donation today to help them win this effort. 
$30,000 — production of television and radio spots alerting the public to the findings of the above survey. 
Money must be in hand by mid-August to reserve time for September and October! 
They have the financial backing of powerful special interests and the determination to ignore the will of the people of Alaska and the American public. 
SIGN the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to show your support for repealing “same-day airborne land-and-shoot” wolf killing in Alaska; 2. 
Remember, for this emergency effort to succeed, we must act immediately. 
And then, mail it back to us along with your emergency donation to help save Alaska’s wolves. 
Sincerely, Rodger Schlickeisen President P.S.: Defenders needs your help to raise $100,000 in emergency funds to help ensure that the coalition’s Emergency Effort to Save Alaska’s Wolves succeeds. 
Time is so short.

Dear Friend of Animals, I hope you’ll use the enclosed name labels, and colorful pet stickers, designed especially for friends of animals. 
I wish I could tell you that everyone is concerned about protecting earth’s animals -- dogs, cats, farm animals and wildlife. 
Every day of the year, The Humane Society of the United States receives reports about all kinds of animal cruelties, such as the horrors of the leghold trap; the use of dog and cat fur; needless or repetitive experiments on animals; and the abusive treatment of dogs and cats. 
And almost 6,000,000 companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout America. 
needless deaths that could have been stopped! 
Since 1954, our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties. 
Our primary goal, though, has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens, so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering, abuse and exploitation. 
It’s a difficult problem, because we have to fight the well-financed and powerful agri-business and research industries, but we do our best to protect the animals. 
And that’s where you can help. 
It’s a wonderful way to enjoy their companionship and save the life of a loving animal, too. 
Your gift of at least $5 or $10 or even $15, will help The HSUS save millions of animals. 
Please help us carry this message to others so that animal cruelty and abuse can be eliminated. 
We are totally committed to putting an end to all forms of animal cruelty and neglect. 
Please take this moment to be as generous as possible to send your best gift today, and don’t forget to use your free colorful pet stickers and name labels enclosed.

IFAW ANIMAL SANCTUARY FUND Your donation will help give an animal a safe home! 
Be sure to write me back to let me know your 2001 Calendar has arrived m good order. 
Don’t you agree that the lion and baby seal are looking right into your eyes? 
And if you have ever experienced to sight of a diving dolphin, you will be brought instantly back to that exciting moment when turning to our August image. 
Can you imagine the baby seal crying out for fear as a sealer raises his club? 
Many of our critics say that you and I who love animals attribute intelligent and sensitive qualities to “stupid, non-feeling” animals. 
It is humane. 
All animals need a place to “get to” in order to be safe from bullets, cruelty, traps and clubs. 
Box I 93 Yarmouth Port, MA 02615-01 ‘www.lfaw.org IFAW is now launching our year 2001 Animal Sanctuary Fund to provide safe places for animals to live out of the danger tat comes from humans and loss of habitat. 
Whether it is to fund additional land for the Addo elephant park in South Africa where 29 calves were born this year or our partnership with Future Generations to save vital habitat for moon bears, bengal tigers and other animals, or our response to move orphaned lions to 500 acres of protected African bush where they will live safely for the rest of their lives… we are committed to the concept of ANIMAL SANCTUARIES. 
I won’t even ask if you support this program. 
I do not like to ask for money No one does. 
Be absolutely sure, your donations do save lives. 
Many people know us as the Save the Seals people and we have saved thousands of animals - seals, elephants, cats, dogs, bears, whales. 
I thought you would enjoy our 2001 Animal Sanctuary Calendar. 
Gifts of $100, $25, and $15 all are important to keep our Animal Sanctuary Fund operating.

MOST OF THE LIGHTS ARE OFF AND SUNLIGHT IS STREAMING THROUGH THE WINDOWS - DAY Camera follows closely, two feet walking down a stone hallway. 
The camera zooms out as the feet stop at a set of heavy, wooden doors. 
CLARK flips on the lights. 
CLARK turns the lights off and turns to leave but is met in the doorway by ERNST, who is wielding a fire poker. 
Mr. 
JEFFERY CLARK Ernst? 
It's me Jeffery. 
I didn't hear you knock, and Mister Tembo didn't tell me to expect you. 
ERNST is leading CLARK down another shadowy hallway. 
I didn't hear much of anything before I got on the plane. 
Perhaps it would be best if I let the doctor apprise you of the situation. 
Dr. 
Tembo's nephew, Jeffery Clark. 
DR. 
I wish I could say the same about your uncle. 
DR. 
Mr. 
JEFFERY CLARK What kind of accident? 
Tembo saved some bloody American's life...Oh, sorry Master Jeffery JEFFERY CLARK It's all right, Ernst. 
I thought Uncle Roland gave up hunting after that incident in San Diego. 
TAMBALA It was a sightseeing safari. 
Mr. 
The tour bus caught up with them a few minutes later, but one of the tourists was already dead, the other was hurt, and Roland was almost done for. 
DR. 
He is lucky to be alive, but he's completely paralyzed below the waist, and he's lost use of his right arm. 
DR. 
JEFFERY CLARK Can he speak? 
DR. 
INT - ROLAND'S BEDROOM - DAY CLARK makes his way into ROLAND's room. 
I.V. 
CLARK sits on the chair near ROLAND's head. 
ROLAND TEMBO >(Stirring slowly, attempting to move the mask) Jeffery, my boy, so good to see you. 
ROLAND TEMBO >(Smiling faintly) Very true. 
JEFFERY CLARK Mom sends her best. 
ROLAND TEMBO I know she and I haven't been as close as a brother and sister should have... 
ROLAND stops him. 
JEFFERY CLARK We're all going to die, Uncle. 
ROLAND TEMBO There was one hunt I never finished. 
JEFFERY CLARK The T-Rex? 
JEFFERY CLARK You used what you had, Uncle Roland. 
ROLAND TEMBO It could happen again, because I didn't bag the rex when I had the chance. 
ROLAND TEMBO Jeffery, I am not long for this Earth. 
ROLAND TEMBO >(Nodding) With that. 
JEFFERY CLARK >(Standing and walking toward the case) Is that Grandpa's gun? 
They created the rex, and from what I've read in the paper, they created a beast capable of killing the rex. 
ROLAND TEMBO >(interrupting) And we have to finish it. 
ROLAND TEMBO Jeffrey, please. 
JEFFERY CLARK Promise me one thing. 
JEFFERY CLARK Don't go anywhere until I bring you the trophy. 
CLARK exits and shuts the door behind him. 
- DAY Start with a wide shot of the cemetery. 
We can't see his face, but he makes his way over to two other individuals standing apart from the main group who we only see from the back. 
The other two people, GRANT and SATTLER turn to look at him. 
Grant, Dr. 
ALAN GRANT >(whispered) Dr. 
ELLIE SATTLER >(whispered) Hello, Ian. 
IAN MALCOLM Yeah, the rain delayed the flight. 
STRUG >(from the head of the congregation) ...Let us go now, not in sadness, but rejoicing in the knowledge that our husband, our father, our grandfather, and our friend has been granted eternal salvation and a place where he may walk with the angels in Heaven. 
IAN MALCOLM >(to casket) Well, John, for the first time in a long time, I don't know what to say. 
Ah, that's not what I meant to say...Maybe I'd better just leave it as "goodbye". 
MALCOM takes a single rose from inside of his jacket and tosses on the coffin. 
ALAN GRANT It is strange to think of how many deaths that he was partly responsible for, and it's only catching up to him now. 
He was just so intent on making history that he forgot the human cost could be devastating. 
Grant, Dr. 
Malcolm? 
SAMUEL PERKINS Hi, I'm Samuel Perkins, executor of Mr. 
While we were drawing up his final will, he wanted me to make sure I contacted you in person. 
SAMUEL PERKINS (CONT'D) If you'd like to stop by my office tomorrow, and I know you're all very busy, so I'd be more than happy to finish this up as soon as possible. 
BOOKCASES LINE THE WALLS, A TV ON A MOBILE STAND IS BEHIND THE DESK WITH A LEATHER CHAIR. 
I was no longer a lunatic who had seen dinosaurs with a bunch of other people who didn't. 
In retrospect, it wasn’t worth lying. 
ALAN GRANT I'm sorry, Ian. 
It's water under the bridge. 
He is carrying a large manila envelope. 
I know we all have business to tend to today, so I'll be as brief as possible. 
SAMUEL PERKINS (CONT'D) I, Jonathon Parker Hammond, as my final wish request that the following video be shown only to Alan Grant, Ellen Sattler, and Ian Malcolm and only to the three of the aforementioned as a group of three on the occasion of my death." IAN MALCOLM Just your average "farewell from beyond the grave" boilerplate, huh? 
Hammond hated lawyers almost as much as he hated the language we use. 
Mr. 
ALAN GRANT (Searching for the word) He was... 
IAN MALCOLM To put it mildly. 
He is dressed in a robe and is clearly reclining in a hospital bed with I.V. 
JOHN HAMMOND G'day. 
I have passed from this life to, what I hope will be a merciful afterlife. 
Dr. 
Dr. 
I thank Dr. 
Before the disaster on Isla Nublar, I thought of myself as the creator of a perfect system, a god of the island itself. 
Thank you, Ian, for teaching me that there are some things Man cannot control. 
Grant, I want to thank you again for taking care of my grandchildren in the park. 
When I am gone they will need someone to be their caretakers, their advocates, and their guardians. 
I'm not asking you because I feel you owe me anything, quite the opposite, I am asking you to take this responsibility because you are the only three people in the world I know I can trust to make the right decisions. 
I've also set up a trust fund for the defense of the islands, Mr. 
Any other information you could need lies in the mind of Dr. 
He was my head engineer at Site B. 
Wang went to work for a firm in Seattle...GenetiCorp. 
God bless you, and good luck. 
Hammond said, I have all of the papers for the Dinosaur Defense Fund right here... 
All four people move closer to the TV as PERKINS turns the sound on. 
Witnesses estimate its length at about forty of fifty feet with gigantic, tooth-filled jaws. 
One of the dogs from the neighborhood ran up to it and started barking. 
The whole village shook. 
MELINA ORTEGA (CONT'D) (Motioning for the camera to point toward military vehicles in the background) As you can see behind me, the U.S. 
Apparently they were engaging in training maneuvers near the Panama Canal when word of this broke. 
Camera focuses on a tank. 
They're on the mainland. 
IAN MALCOLM Damn it, John, you knew this could happen. 
CNN ANCHOR Our thoughts and prayers for a safe return are with you, Melina. 
A grainy video recorded at early dawn shows a two-legged dinosaur tearing open a car and disappearing into the jungle. 
The picture quality isn't good, but you can clearly see what can only be described as a dinosaur attacking a car. 
CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D) Of course, we haven't seen anything like this since the 1997 incident in San Diego, when a Tyrannosaurus Rex created by InGen got loose and went on a rampage through the city. 
GRANT, SATTLER, and PERKINS are all glued to the TV when there is a knock at the door. 
A young Army officer steps into the office. 
Alan Grant and Dr. 
ALAN GRANT That's us. 
LT. 
IAN MALCOLM What? 
LT. 
ALAN GRANT Look, Miss... 
AMY BRANNIGAN It's Lieutenant, Lieutenant Brannigan. 
It's just that a lot has happened in such a short time, and I think we're all just going to need a little time to put it all together. 
AMY BRANNIGAN Sir, I know you might feel that way right now, but I have been ordered to bring you with me without delay. 
Grant here, Lieutenant. 
AMY BRANNIGAN Sir, there are two Military Police officer waiting in the hall and two more outside. 
ALAN GRANT Well, Ian, it looks like we'd better go. 
Wang. 
ELLIE SATTLER You think this has something to do with the incident in Costa Rica? 
EXT - ISLA SORNA - DAWN EXT - CLARK IS CROUCHING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE T-REX NEST ON ISLA SORNA. 
- DAWN CLARK reaches up to press a button on his left shoulder. 
I have been to all of the locations that the animals were said to frequent but without avail. 
I regret that I am coming home from this hunt empty-handed. 
COSTA RICA - MIDDAY EXT - A BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER LANDS IN SAMARA, COSTA RICA. 
- MIDDAY As the helicopter lands, GRANT and MALCOLM debark. 
GEN. 
Grant, Dr. 
Sorry we had to drag you here so abruptly, but you know what they say about desperate times. 
Grant. 
SANCHEZ leads GRANT and MALCOLM down to the beach. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ (CONT'D) Frankly, I've never seen anything like this. 
We didn't know what to make of it at first, and how to preserve the specimen was a bit ambiguous, but one of our Marines was a big paleontology nut and had read all about you and your work and how to preserve delicate fossils. 
GEN. 
IAN MALCOLM What I saw was a dinosaur in a highly-developed, downtown area with nowhere to hide. 
It might as well be back on the island. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ But you did see the dinosaurs on the islands? 
GEN. 
IAN MALCOLM Yes, but I'm sure Dr. 
ALAN GRANT Scared, Ian? 
I have been brought into a dinosaur-infested area to provide advice I'm not competent to give. 
It's only one. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ Regardless of your objections, Dr. 
The government wouldn't have brought you into this area unless it felt you would be an asset. 
GEN. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ (CONT'D) What do you make of that, Dr. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ Okay, I'll call the Pentagon. 
IAN MALCOLM Spinosaurus? 
IAN MALCOLM Odd, we didn't. 
IAN MALCOLM I didn't read much of anything on your misadventure on Site B. 
I was actually working with Universal in L.A. 
I only accepted the offer to help fund the research we're doing in Montana. 
Do you think the public will buy that? 
Several Marines shout as they hurry to cover the footprint. 
GEN. 
You are not authorized to land here, return to your point of origin immediately. 
He is carrying a large duffel bag and wearing khaki trousers, khaki shirt, and a black ball cap. 
The chopper takes off as the man is surrounded by Marines and Humvees. 
IAN MALCOLM (pointing toward the circle of Marines and the man) I think he's going over to greet the newcomer. 
He is at gunpoint and on his knees with his hands behind his head. 
The man, CLARK, who has his hands cuffed behind his back is being lead over to SANCHEZ. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ (shouting at CLARK) Just who the hell are you and what the hell do you think you're doing? 
GEN. 
This is a no-fly zone. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ You can't be serious. 
I'm here now, and I'll be on my way back to the island just as soon as I buy some food. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ Oh no, you're not. 
What island were you hunting on? 
IAN MALCOLM You were hunting dinosaurs? 
JEFFERY CLARK (CONT'D) (recognizing MALCOLM) Wait, are you Ian Malcolm? 
Do I know you? 
IAN MALCOLM I wouldn't say I knew him that well. 
GEN. 
Mr. 
As much as I hate it, you are stuck here until the beast is captured. 
What beast? 
GEN. 
Grant! 
ALAN GRANT What *about* the rexes? 
Two adults and the baby. 
JEFFERY CLARK So there might be two more dinosaurs on the mainland? 
IAN MALCOLM He's right. 
Maybe the Spinosaur killed the other two in the interim since he killed the first one maybe they swam for it and drowned. 
CPL. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ What is it? 
CPL. 
GEN. 
CPL. 
It's smaller, Sir. 
GEN. 
GEN. 
It's about fifteen or twenty kilometers up the coast. 
A T-Rex moving at full speed was clocked at thirty-some miles per hour. 
GEN. 
It had plenty of time to get up there. 
RICK TOWNSEND Sir, we have reason to believe the tracks were made less than an hour ago. 
GEN. 
ALAN GRANT And what's the size difference? 
RICK TOWNSEND Twelve inches, Sir. 
CPL. 
JEFFERY CLARK (motioning to his hands) General, would you mind? 
JEFFERY CLARK (CONT'D) What about my bag? 
HORATIO SANCHEZ It's still being searched. 
In the mean time, stay put. 
GRANT's phone rings. 
The shot cuts between each speaker as they talk. 
ELLIE SATTLER Alan, it's Ellie. 
How are you doing? 
ELLIE SATTLER I found Dr. 
He was less than willing to be helpful, but I managed to glean a few things. 
ELLIE SATTLER As it turns out, the spino was one of the first dinosaurs bred on the island. 
ELLIE SATTLER Alan, the spino and the rexes don't need supplemental enzymes to survive. 
ALAN GRANT Then how can we stop them? 
ALAN GRANT Thanks, Ellie. 
GRANT walks back toward SANCHEZ, MALCOLM, and CLARK. 
Sattler? 
IAN MALCOLM What did she find out? 
HORATIO SANCHEZ (walking back from the tent) Who's Dr. 
GEN. 
ALAN GRANT It means the animals can exist indefinitly eating non-lysine-enriched food. 
ALAN GRANT I'm afraid so. 
Clark, I can't in good conscience let a civillian go on his own when there are not one, but two, dangerous creatures still running amok. 
JEFFERY CLARK Are you talking about my uncle's elephant gun or my rifle? 
HORATIO SANCHEZ Jesus, Clark, it's a fifty caliber anti-material rifle, not your everyday deer gun. 
ALAN GRANT Wait a minute. 
IAN MALCOLM You think the rex is chasing the Spinosaur? 
If they destroyed your trailers because you took their infant, imagine what they'd have done if you had killed it. 
How would it have even tracked it? 
The T-Rex was only a few hours behind the Spinosaur. 
GEN. 
I think it's pretty clear that we seal off Costa Rica's borders. 
IAN MALCOLM Considering, General, that these animals swam two-hundred miles to get here, I think it's safe to say they could swim from here to South America without much difficulty. 
If we find the T-Rex, it will lead us to the Spinosaur. 
First we'll have to figure out a more secure method for containing them. 
GEN. 
Grant, the official position is to neutralize the threat as quickly as possible. 
If we build a better cage, they are just going to break out again and again. 
We are the only people who can protect the animals and the island. 
IAN MALCOLM How many disasters will it take, Alan? 
When the good of the world is on the line, we have to sacrifice the good of our charges. 
Punish them for evolving? 
We don't have time for a philosophical debate here. 
ALAN GRANT Fine. 
I suggest that we send one person to track him. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ Any suggestions as to who the one person might be? 
HORATIO SANCHEZ Him? 
Do you feel up to it? 
GEN. 
JEFFERY CLARK Also provided that I am the one who takes the Tyrannosaur. 
HORATIO SANCHEZ What is it, Townsend?

It is a *drawing* of a key. 
LEECH Keys... 
*things*? 
So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks! 
If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. 
GIBBS So - We're going after this key! 
Any more questions? 
Do we have a heading? 
A heading.

[Jack takes a drink from the bottle] JACK SPARROW And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?

WILL TURNER Does it matter? 
In exchange the charges against us will be dropped. 
Where will you find him? 
I'll start there, and I won't stop searching 'til I find him. 
ELIZABETH SWANN If it weren't for these bars I'd have you already.

That's all I need, Elizabeth is in danger. 
She faces the gallows! 
Savvy? 
What about Elizabeth? 
Prisoners Where you goin'...?) ELIZABETH SWANN Why don't you tell me what's happening? 
Will has gone to find Jack! 
[a horse and carriage are waiting, the governor opens the door to the carriage for Elizabeth] ELIZABETH SWANN A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging. 
Shame, huh? 
It's a letter to the King. 
[horses and soldiers arrive to cut off the governor from fleeing from the dock] [the carriage door is opened, but the carriage is empty, Elizabeth is gone] MERCER Where is she? 
[Elizabeth slips into the dark room from an interior door, hands held behind her] ELIZABETH SWANN Then what is? 
ELIZABETH SWANN I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT I'm listening. 
ELIZABETH SWANN These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King? 
It will do you no good. 
ELIZABETH SWANN I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Ah, I see. 
So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT So I did. 
Or fate intervenes. 
ELIZABETH SWANN These aren't going to Jack. 
To ensure Mister Turner's freedom, then? 
Consider that in your calculations. 
Anyways, I ain't stealin' no ship. 
It's *salvagin'*! 
RAGETTI Since we're not immortal no more. 
PINTEL You know you can't read. 
You get credit for trying. 
*That's* a mark against ya! 
There it is! 
PINTEL Must've seen a catfish. 
[both laugh, the dog reaches shore and looks back at them] RAGETTI Stupid mongrel! 
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[Will pulls a sword from the waistband of a pirate who is turned around, points it at Jack] WILL TURNER I need that Compass of yours, Jack. 
[Jack pushes Will's sword aside] JACK SPARROW Mister Gibbs! 
trifling need, uh/a... 
JACK SPARROW No, a... 
*You* want you to find this. 
what's-her-face. 
WILL TURNER This... 
JACK SPARROW How much do you know about Davy Jones? 
JACK SPARROW Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth. 
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share, and wear it one after the other. 
This ship is haunted. 
female presence... 
all the men... 
The ghost of a lady, widowed before her marriage, I figure it. 
A virgin, too, likely as not. 
BURSAR I say... 
QUARTERMASTER No! 
What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back! 
Enough! 
Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. 
I want you to search the ship and find 'er. 
she's probably naked. 
GIBBS Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. 
And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. 
[Marty turns around at mention of the word, Pintel and Ragetti look at each other] GIBBS They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! 
If you believe such things. 
*Her*. 
GIBBS Aye. 
Nigh inseparable we are. 
GIBBS I'll watch your back. 
Mind the boat. 
MARTY Mind the boat. 
Mind the boat!

TIA DALMA You want to know *me*. 
We've come for help and we're not leaving without it. 
Hmmm? 
JACK SPARROW I brought payment. 
[Jack cocks his pistol, shoots the monkey, the bullet has no effect, but the monkey chatters in fright] JACK SPARROW An undead monkey! 
[Tia lifts the cage door, the monkey scampers off] GIBBS No! 
TIA DALMA The payment is fair. 
And what it goes to. 
It cannot lead you to dis? 
Why? 
Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! 
do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. 
GIBBS What *is* inside? 
Jewels? 
[a jar of eyeballs is hanging next to Ragetti's face as he speaks] TIA DALMA You know of... 
A man of de sea. 
WILL TURNER What vexes all men? 
RAGETTI Dichotomy of good and evil. 
GIBBS No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with. 
See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. 
But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. 
WILL TURNER What... 
TIA DALMA Him heart. 
PINTEL He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest! 
TIA DALMA It was not wort' feeling what... 
WILL TURNER You knew this. 
I didn't know where the key was. 
So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey! 
[Jack shows his right hand is untouched, but Tia unwraps the bandage on his left hand] [the black spot on Jack's left hand is revealed] GIBBS Uhhh! 
[Gibbs quickly wipes his hands on his chest, spins around once to the left, and spits] Black spot! 
[Pintel and Ragetti copy Gibbs' ritual, in synchrony] JACK SPARROW My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know. 
Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow. 
jar of dirt going to help? 
JACK SPARROW No. 
WILL TURNER It seems...

JACK SPARROW Neither do you. 
[Jack gives Gibbs a meaningful glance, elbows Gibbs] GIBBS Must've run afoul of the reef. 
WILL TURNER I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key. 
WILL TURNER I cut down anyone in my path. 
Simple, easy to remember. 
Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha! 
If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! 
RAGETTI Bon voyage! 
WILL TURNER There's no use. 
WOUNDED SAILOR No! 
Foul breath! 
Hey! 
[Will slices open the stomach of one of the invaders, fish spill out of it onto the deck] [Will battles the invading crewmembers, but one of them knocks Will unconscious] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. 
The rest have moved on. 
Do you fear that dark abyss? 
All your sins punished. 
an escape-uh. 
DAVY JONES To the depths. 
[unidentified crewman] Cold blooded - ! 
Why should the afterlife be any *different*? 
Join my crew, and postpone the judgment. 
Will ye serve? 
DAVY JONES Grand. 
What is your purpose here? 
DAVY JONES What is your purpose here? 
Have you not introduced yourself all these years as *Captain* Jack Sparrow? 
JACK SPARROW Aha! 
DAVY JONES Price? 
JACK SPARROW Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth? 
[Maccus blocks Jack from exiting] DAVY JONES I keep the boy. 
That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go. 
Worth at least four... 
And did I happen to mention... 
With a girl. 
would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. 
DAVY JONES I keep the boy. 
But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? 
JACK SPARROW Yep! 
Should we seal it in blood? 
DAVY JONES Three days. 
[Pintel whimpers, with a knife held to his neck from a crewmember of Jones' ship] [Jack looks at his hand, it's covered with slime, but the black spot disappears under the effect of the slime] JACK SPARROW Oh, Mr. 
GIBBS Aye. 
GIBBS And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days? 
GIBBS Ah... 
JACK SPARROW Tortuga. 
Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. 
BELLAMY A *pirate* port is what you mean. 
An honest sailor is what I am. 
[a white dress floats by the cabin window, outside] BURSAR S-S-Sir! 
do something. 
[the dress sweeps over a lantern, knocking it over and part of the deck ignites] BELLAMY Over there! 
[the crew rush to the railing and look out at the sea] [Elizabeth, up on the mast overhead, sighs in exasperation] QUARTERMASTER Look there! 
QUARTERMASTER S-Seaweed can be a sign. 
That would be a bad sign. 
[Elizabeth is now sitting on a platform on the deck behind the men, pointing at the deck where the lantern fell] [the men at the railing turn around and look where Elizabeth is pointing] [the fire burning on the desk spells out "Tortuga" in fiery letters] Tortuga [men are tied up with ropes alongside a well, camera pans past the well] [a man is tied up and being dunked in the well, and is spouting water from his mouth] [crowded tavern, glass bottles are being shot off of people's heads for entertainment] [a duo of musicians is playing a guitar and accordion] GIBBS And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl? 
I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young. 
Make your mark. 
JILTED MAN My wife ran off with my dog. 
And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die. 
Next! 
GIBBS It's the crow's nest for you. 
GIBBS Next!

That gives us - four!

You didn't try to sail through it? 
[unidentified woman] Oh! 
[Norrington spots Jack sneaking off behind him, points a pistol at Jack] NORRINGTON Or should I just kill you now? 
NORRINGTON Sorry. 
[unidentifed man, to Norrington] Easy, sonny! 
GIBBS Aye! 
[the two men throw the carried man off the balcony, then Jack continues on his way] [the music stops, Norrington threateningly holds a bottle in his left hand] NORRINGTON Come on, men! 
Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. 
[from behind, Elizabeth grabs the bottle from Norrington, smashes it over his head, knocking him out] ELIZABETH SWANN I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself! 
Heave! 
Heave! 
Heave! 
BO'SUN: Step to-it/tight! 
BO'SUN: Regain-yourselves!/Mind-yourself!

BO'SUN: Impeding me in my duties. 
DAVY JONES Will you now? 
DAVY JONES Ha ha ha ha! 
What fortuitous circumstance be this! 
I believe it is. 
Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own. 
[Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip] [two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back] [Bootstrap whips Will's back five times] [Will is tossed into a lower part of the deck, partially filled with water] [Will stands up, wearing an intact white shirt] BO'SUN: You had it easy, boy! 
WILL TURNER I don't need your help! 
FLYING DUTCHMAN below deck [Bootstrap and Will enter the interior of the ship together] [crewmember Wyvern is seen to their right, encrusted into the interior side of the hull, standing up] WILL TURNER I've sworn no oath. 
The key. 
WILL TURNER What do you know of this? 
No-no-no-no. 
The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain. 
WILL TURNER So the captain has the key. 
WYVERN Hidden. 
WYVERN Hidden. 
JACK SPARROW Come to join me crew, lad? 
ELIZABETH SWANN I'm here to find the man I love. 
[Norrington vomits over the side] ELIZABETH SWANN Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow. 
It should be a dress or nothing. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Jack. 
Where is he? 
through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew. 
[Norrington vomits over the side, then spits] NORRINGTON Oh, please. 
JACK SPARROW You look bloody awful. 
NORRINGTON You *hired* me. 
JACK SPARROW You *smell* funny. 
Is that what you really want most? 
JACK SPARROW Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most. 
JACK SPARROW Well, there is a chest... 
JACK SPARROW A chest of unknown size and origin. 
RAGETTI Unh-unh... 
unh-unh... 
saving brave William from his grim fate. 
ELIZABETH SWANN How do we find it? 
My Compass... 
NORRINGTON "Unique" here having the meaning of broken. 
This Compass does not point north. 
JACK SPARROW It points to the thing you want most in this world. 
JACK SPARROW By finding the chest of Davy Jones. 
GIBBS Cap'n. 
GIBBS Finally! 
JACK SPARROW Miss Swann. 
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh... 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT I had you brought here because I thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter. 
*And* other fugitives from justice. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept. 
FLYING DUTCHMAN deck [slow motion scene of falling dice] [three crewman are playing Liar's Dice] [organ music is heard in the background] MACCUS I wager... 
KOLENIKO I'll match ten years. 
WILL TURNER I understand. 
WILL TURNER It's a game of deception. 
WILL TURNER What are they wagering? 
WILL TURNER I challenge Davy Jones. 
An eternity of servitude. 
WILL TURNER I want this. 
WILL TURNER That's not part of the game, is it? 
[One of Jones' tentacles pulls out the key from his vest to display it] [the tentacle puts the key back] [Bootstrap sits down at the table] DAVY JONES What's this? 
Don't do this. 
WILL TURNER Four fives. 
WILL TURNER Eight fives. 
Welcome to the crew, liar. 
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship! 
Why did you do that?

WILL TURNER I take this with a promise. 
And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. 
I promise. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company. 
GIBBS Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word. 
GIBBS Beckett wants the Compass. 
JACK SPARROW Of course. 
JACK SPARROW A truly discomforting notion, love. 
Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. 
Brace the foreyard! 
ELIZABETH SWANN Persuasion. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Decidedly not. 
Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. 
JACK SPARROW No. 
ELIZABETH SWANN You do know Will taught me how handle a sword. 
There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me. 
NORRINGTON Oh, I think you do. 
I trust him, that's all. 
Edinburgh Trader BELLAMY Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters. 
As fast as you can. 
[Will sees Elizabeth's white wedding dress on a chair in the cabin] WILL TURNER That dress. 
BELLAMY It was found aboard the ship. 
WILL TURNER That's foolish. 
Proceededly foolish. 
And we made a nice bit of profit there. 
WILL TURNER I imagine... 
BELLAMY Why do you ask? 
BELLAMY Colors? 
BELLAMY Pirates! 
FLYING DUTCHMAN deck [Jones is on deck, having found the cloth that Will swapped for the key] [Bootstrap is held at knife point on board the Flying Dutchman] [one crewman holds a sawfish sword as a restraining weapon in front of Bootstrap] DAVY JONES You will watch this.

DAVY JONES *I* am the sea. 
What of the survivors? 
[the remaining crewmen are simultanenously axed from behind] [Will witnesses the axing, ducks behind a beam] [Jones turns around, sensing Will, but sees nothing] DAVY JONES The chest is no longer safe. 
Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay. 
DAVY JONES Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship? 
Jack Sparrow. 
I *am*... 
Right here. 
Right... 
[Elizabeth recoils at Jack's breath on the word "now"] ELIZABETH SWANN No, thank you. 
Us. 
Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. 
[Jack smells his armpits] JACK SPARROW Trifles. 
ELIZABETH SWANN You seem very certain. 
You long for freedom. 
To act on selfish impulse. 
One day, you won't be able to resist. 
JACK SPARROW Uh my Compass works fine. 
To do the right thing. 
something courageous. 
Want to know why? 
ELIZABETH SWANN Curiosity. 
A chance to be admired.

Iraq clears visit by Ohio official By Scott Montgomery Washington The Iraqi government has agreed to let U.S. 
Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office said Monday. 
Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended, which some say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from the devastation of the bombing campaign. 
In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of ``semi starvation.'' Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in Iraq since the war, according to Hall's office.

If supplies are not reaching the people who need them, Hall said, he wanted to find out whether the United Nations or relief agencies needed to handle things differently, or whether "Iraq needs to get out of the way and let us do the job."

Tony Hall, D-Ohio, did not call for a lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but said the United Nations should make sure that sanctions do not hurt innocent Iraqis.

The ethics panel also ordered Torricelli to pay back Chang -- with interest -- for the full value of a large-screen television set and compact-disc player, and for expensive earrings that Chang gave to Torricelli's sister, to one of his close aides and to one of Torricelli's former girlfriends. 
The ethics panel, to which evidence from the criminal case was forwarded, concluded its review just as Torricelli is gearing up his campaign for re-election against the Republican candidate, Douglas R. 
After months in which polls showed Torricelli well ahead of his relatively unknown Republican rival, the contest has narrowed in recent weeks. 
Packwood later resigned. 
Daniel K. 
"The document speaks for itself," said Inouye, who said that he considered the matter closed with the letter. 
Torricelli also insisted that he had not done any unusual favors for Chang, who first turned to the senator in 1995 for help in winning the repayment of some $71 million he said he was then owed in a failed business deal with the North Korean government. 
The committee did not confirm some of the most serious allegations, including Chang's claim that he gave Torricelli tens of thousands of dollars in cash. 
But at the time of Chang's sentencing, the judge, Alfred M. 
In Torricelli's case, it acted without conducting a full investigation, saying the case had been exhaustively scrutinized by federal authorities. 
Simon, said Tuesday night that he was disappointed that the ethics panel had confirmed only a handful of the gifts he said his client had given Torricelli, and that the panel did not deal with what he said were actions by Torricelli to thwart the federal investigation. 
According to two government officials involved in the inquiry, the Ethics Committee received a vast amount of information from federal investigators, some of it under a court order issued in March. 
Balaban. 
Nor did it cite a $1,590 Oriental carpet that Chang gave to Torricelli's former wife, Susan Holloway Torricelli. 
The committee confirmed Torricelli's claims he had made partial repayments to Chang for two gifts: a large-screen television and a stereo compact-disc player. 
A person familiar with Torricelli's testimony to the committee said he had told its members that he repaid the "wholesale" cost of the appliances because Chang told him that was what he had paid. 
The statues, the existence of which had not been publicly known before, were displayed in Torricelli's Senate office. 
The senator's belief "that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances" displayed poor judgment and violated Senate gift rules, the panel found. 
The analysis, which was assembled from banking and credit records, income-tax returns and congressional financial-disclosure forms, showed by March of 1998, Torricelli's cash expenditures were more than $22,000 in excess of the cash he had generated from checks and automatic-teller machines, an official who has reviewed the document said. 
"Senator Torricelli provided the committee with a full explanation of sources of income and any funds used for cash purposes," she said. 
The United States cut virtually all military links with Indonesia in 1999 after its forces were implicated in the violence that swept East Timor after that territory voted for independence. 
"We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the international community," the ministers said in a communique on Tuesday. 
Terrorism dominates the agenda, though the possibility of a meeting here between Powell and his North Korean counterpart, Paek Nam Sun, has generated the most news. 
Powell heads to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, late on Thursday before finishing a weeklong trip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday. 
Indonesia is already receiving $400,000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training programs and is to receive a like amount next year; and the United States expects to provide an additional $16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism. 
But a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and Congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation, which would require congressional approval. 
Megawati is committed to this cause," Powell said in Singapore. 
In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. 
His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. 
Powell said his discussions with Mahathir "touched on the case" of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that Powell said the United States had "always felt" were flawed. 
MICROSOFT TEAMS WITH AT&T TO OFFER SOFTWARE FOR WIRELESS DEVICES AND SERVICES Microsoft plans to announce on Wednesday a partnership with AT&T Wireless Services to offer software for wireless devices and services, a person close to the talks said Tuesday night. 
Microsoft's efforts to persuade wireless carriers to use its cell phone operating system have struggled. 
But Microsoft's potential advantage, analysts say, is its ability to link its cell phone software to its desktop PC software, a Microsoft stronghold. 
In recent months, Microsoft has announced partnerships with wireless carriers like Verizon and Sprint PCS.

Colon has won four of five decisions for the Expos, but Floyd batted only .208 for them while hitting three home runs, including one Tuesday night, and driving in four runs.

EX-HOG OFFERS JUMP-START AND HELPS CHANGE LIVES WASHINGTON With the barrage of crack cocaine-connected killings in the 1980s came the realization that young people were too often full-fledged players in the violence. 
"There was death in D.C. 
"It wasn't like New York's or Boston's organized crime. 
It was a 14-year-old from R Street who got his crew of six together and ran their drug block killing another 14-year-old and his crew from a block away. 
I could see that you needed the private sector involved." Starke could see that in many instances these were cases of lost dignity. 
Starke, I'm tired of going to bed at night with a Tech-9 gun under my pillow."' And Starke was tired of seeing Washington and its young people suffer a black eye. 
The school, now in its third year, has been so successful that it recently received a $2 million grant from Congress. 
The program is coordinated with the University of the District of Columbia. 
Thanks to Starke's vision, leadership and fund-raising, they can do it all free. 
He was recently named one of the 70 greatest Redskins. 
In 1988 he bought a Ford dealership. 
"I saw a lot of kids and young men out there with no dads and no structure who couldn't read and some of them were beginning to realize that there is no growing old as a crack dealer -- you either die or go to jail," he said. 
The institute has a full-time staff of 18. 
Seventy students are participating in summer classes. 
Angela Nafis, 47, of Ecuador, has been in the school for a year. 
Charles Easterling, 24, said he had been enrolled for a month but lived "wherever." "I'm homeless now trying to find a place to lay my head," he said. 
Easterling said he would do whatever it took to become stable. 
Not bad for a guy who was kicked out of high school in 1997 for threatening a teacher. 
"It shows if you have the will and the dedication here you can learn a lot and be something. 
This school is like a big family." Edward Jewell, 56, retired from his job as a copyright assistant at the Library of Congress in 1993. 
"I needed a new skill. 
I get up and come down here at 6 a.m. 
I'm grateful to George Starke to have had the vision to set something like this up, not just for me but for all the students. 
And when I become a technician, I will help the poor and needy by giving them affordable rates." Starke said the school would move to a building near the city's bus depot in the fall. 
He is proud of the red Cobra 427 that sits in the school's workshop. 
His current class is rebuilding a black one. 
"I just wanted to be a part," said Starke, who is certain he is the lone Redskin, past or present, who lives in the city. 
"A lot of kids are afraid of 'the process' and I wanted to take 'the process' out. 
A little more than 50 percent of our kids make it through. 
The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. 
In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. 
Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. 
silver dollar, which sold for $4.14 million in 1999. 
"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business," said Lawrence R. 
"This is the Mona Lisa of coins," said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. 
Forbidden fruit." Collectors' Web sites have surged with speculation about the sale price, and enthusiasts even organized betting pools. 
The tension in the crowd was broken with a burst of applause after the $5 million mark, and a louder explosion at $6 million. 
Most bidders dropped out after that price. 
The sale price of $6.6 million, when added to the commission, totaled $7.59 million. 
"So the auction was almost like the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the convention," Stack said. 
In 1792, it was deemed that all gold and silver U.S. 
They were called double eagles because their face value was twice that of the original $10 gold piece. 
Roosevelt took the United States off the gold standard, and ordered all the 1933 saints already manufactured destroyed, save for two reserved for the Smithsonian Institution. 
Presumably after being stolen by a mint employee, nine double eagles surfaced during the mid-1940s and 1950s. 
But before these coins came to light, the royal legation of Egypt turned up with one at the Department of the Treasury, and somehow got an official to issue an export license for the coin to enhance the collection of King Farouk. 
His arrest in Manhattan, after attempting to sell the coin for $1.5 million, led to a court battle over whether -- thanks to the Treasury's mistaken export permission in 1944 -- the coin could be legally owned. 
The coin once again escaped destruction when it was moved from the Treasury Department vault in 7 World Trade Center eight months before the building collapsed after the Sept. 
The record price was seen as a gift by coin collectors. 
In a ceremony after the sale, Fore of the mint declared the coin the only 1933 double eagle ever to be legally issued by the U.S. 
ETHICS COMMITTEE CITES TORRICELLI'S 'POOR JUDGMENT' Following are excerpts from the findings of the Senate Ethics Committee's report on Sen. 
Torricelli's dealings with David Chang: 1. 
Chang, rather than fair market retail value, evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rules (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate rules.

DEWAN NEW YORK This 30-second commercial is the first in H. 
ON THE SCREEN The words "His resume is an American dream," a quotation from Time magazine, appear on the screen. 
They show him as an Army lieutenant, at his swearing-in as a state senator, as ambassador to the United Nations, surrounded by children as New York City school board president, and at other jobs, leading up to his current position, state comptroller. 
Carl McCall" appear on the screen. 
Carl McCall, Army lieutenant, state senator, ambassador to the United Nations, school board president, Citibank vice president, and one of the most effective comptrollers in New York history." The candidate says: "I grew up poor with a single mother. 
It can open doors to opportunity. 
As governor, I'll make sure that every kid in New York has the same opportunity I had, to get a good education." ACCURACY This advertisement is long on introductions and short on claims of merit. 
He had the title of ambassador when he was at the United Nations, but he was not the chief of the American mission. 
As for the claim about his success as comptroller, where he controls the state pension funds, there is no disputing the funds' growth during his terms, but some critics say it had more to do with the buoyancy of the stock market in the 1990s than skilled management. 
For one, it counters the high name recognition of Andrew M. 
It also emphasizes leadership, an important campaign issue after Sept. 
At the same time it gives McCall a chance to intertwine his boot-straps story with the broader issue of children and education, a priority of many Democratic voters. 
Nelson, 44, had been the only woman of 14 people on New Jersey's death row. 
The state attorney general's office has not decided whether to seek the death penalty again, a spokesman, Peter Aseltine, said Tuesday. 
Marshall, convicted of arranging the murder of his wife at a picnic area on the Garden State Parkway. 
New Jersey has not had an execution since 1963. 
Zazzali and Justice Virginia Long said in a separate opinion that in addition to the reasons given in the majority opinion, also written by Zazzali, they believed the death penalty would constitute cruel and unusual punishment because of Nelson's history of emotional disturbance. 
Koskovich, who was 18 when he killed two pizza deliverymen in an ambush. 
While all five members of the majority found the instructions to the jury on weighing aggravating and mitigating factors to be confusing, two of those justices wrote in a partial dissent that the prosecutor's statements in his summation about the defense's expert witnesses were within the bounds of acceptable argument. 
Poritz and Justice Peter G. 
Nelson, born Glenn Nelson, had severe psychological problems and a history of reclusive behavior into adulthood, and was convicted on a weapons charge in 1988. 
In April 1995, while she was living with her parents in Haddon Heights, outside Philadelphia, law enforcement officers arrived at the house with a warrant for Nelson's arrest on another weapons charge. 
She pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to death by a jury in 1997. 
Marshall, an insurance agent from Toms River, was convicted of hiring a man to kill his wife while the couple were going home after an evening of dining and gambling in Atlantic City. 
Yet his anti-democratic behavior is an embarrassment to Washington and an affront to his own people. 
Ibrahim, who holds dual United States and Egyptian citizenship, is 63 years old and ailing. 
Ibrahim's harsh punishment sends a chilling message to Egyptians yearning for a more accountable and tolerant society. 
Like every other government institution, they hew closely to Mubarak's wishes. 
Ibrahim might never have been tried had he not written an article taking note of Mubarak's efforts to create a presidential dynasty. 
That aid bonanza was granted to reward Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat, for signing a peace treaty with Israel. 
In recent months President Bush has spoken of the need to promote democracy in the Arab world. 
It is time to extend this policy to Egypt. 
It is a country with a long and glorious history, a substantial middle class, a peace treaty with Israel and large quantities of American aid. 
Its official media are awash in anti-American and anti-Semitic propaganda. 
This is entirely insufficient. 
EDITORIAL: GOVERNOR PATAKI WEIGHS IN The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 31: Responding to a wave of public dismay over the first designs for rebuilding Lower Manhattan, Gov. 
While rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding schedule slightly, it does not need to stall progress if the governor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. 
Renegotiating that issue with the World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately. 
Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. 
Lowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals. 
Pataki's recent remarks are a sign that he understands how central the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own political legacy. 
EDITORIAL: A PALLID CLEAN AIR PLAN The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 31: President Bush has now unveiled his long-awaited "Clear Skies" proposal, which he promises will simplify and strengthen the Clean Air Act without crippling American industry. 
But the Bush plan falls well short of the only other credible proposal on the table, a bill sponsored by Sen. 
Like Jeffords, the president calls for substantial reductions in three major pollutants -- the nitrogen oxides that produce smog, sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and mercury. 
He aims to reduce all three by 70 percent by 2018. 
Finally, the Bush proposal would roll back key provisions of the existing Clean Air Act that Jeffords would keep. 
But some regulations, aimed at specific regional problems that nationwide trading alone is unable to address, cannot lightly be abandoned. 
Indeed, Bush has already made clear his intention to roll back one of the most important of these regulations, a provision known as new source review that compels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever they significantly upgrade older plants. 
The Bush bill, as written, is not the way to get there. 
The e-commerce free zone is situated in north Dubai, near the industrial free zone in Jebel Ali, the top regional and tenth international leading area in container transit. 
Sheikh Mohammed, who is also the UAE Defence Minister, said during the launching ceremony "we wish to make Dubai a center of modern economy". 
He said that it would he possible for the companies working in the electronic trade sector to make Dubai their headquarters, and to establish offices here and provide employment and own machinery in the zone opened to companies fully owned by the foreigners.

By rule, the players to be named later cannot be players on the active major-league roster. 
Orlando Palmeiro was the only backup outfielder on the major-league roster and the outfielders in the minor-league system are too inexperienced to be counted on in a pennant race. 
Ochoa has played in the majors for five different teams starting in 1995. 
Going into this season, he was a career .281 hitter. 
"He's a good defender, he has a good arm, he plays the tough right-field position and plays it well. 
"From a realistic standpoint, were we going to find an outfielder that pushed one of our outfielders to the bench? 
He said he's fine with his role as a reserve outfielder and pinch hitter. 
"It's not the big, earth-shattering stuff," right fielder Tim Salmon said. 
It didn't seem like we had a lot of holes to fill. 
Molina spent all season at Triple-A Salt Lake before joining the major-league club July 17 to replace his injured brother, Bengie. 
"I feel bad for Jorge, he's a good friend of mine," Bengie said. 
I'm very excited we'll be on the same team for a while." Jose went into Wednesday's game hitting .304 and had thrown out 33 percent (two of six) of baserunners trying to steal. 
"I just hope they keep me here," Jose said. 
"I felt like I was a big part of the team. 
The Russian, Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov, who was arrested by the Italian authorities at his resort home in Forte dei Marmi, appeared to have a singular motivation for rigging the competitions: getting a visa to return to France, where he once lived. 
The French ice dancers, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, later won the gold over a Russian team. 
Over the past four years, four judges have been suspended, including a Ukrainian who was taped by a Canadian judge detailing the order of finish for the ice dancers before the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. 
The United States is seeking his extradition from Italy. 
The FBI said explicit conversations about the scheme had been recorded between Tokhtakhounov and his conspirators, and between him and Anissina, who was born in Russia and skated for France, and her mother.

"She's a scapegoat and a target of a corrupt system and was unfairly singled out." Tokhtakhounov, whose age was given by Comey as 53 or 62, is a "major figure in international Eurasian organized crime," Comey said. 
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, he has been implicated in arms trading and Russian art smuggling, and in the Russian news media he was accused of complicity in a plot to extort $10 million from the head of a Russian sports foundation. 
Comey said Tokhtakhounov had three residences in Italy: Forte dei Marmi, Rome and Milan.

The second mobster said the French pair had "only three judges," and of the two judges they needed to win the gold medal "one is ours, and the other our friends will give them."

He assured her that it was nonsense, but that Gailhaguet "knows my name very well -- he tried to help me, and later he made stuff up to scare you so you would not connect me to him even more." The conversations seem to indicate a familiarity between Tokhtakhounov and Anissina. 
That Russian organized crime may have infiltrated international sport at the Olympics stunned Phyllis Howard, president of the U.S. 
"This is a criminal act and it certainly puts things in a different league," Howard said.

-- IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than $2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. 
But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. 
It is spending more than $500 million a year on semiconductor research and development.

In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than $2 billion against earnings. 
But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. 
But industry analysts said the plant should be insulated from a falloff in one or a few segments of the semiconductor market. 
"The diversity is the big difference with this plant," said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm. 
Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. 
Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. 
The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper. 
Yes, said Richard Brilla, director of the new facility, "but the donuts are a lot more costly here." Each wafer, holding hundreds of chips, is worth $6,000 to $10,000 apiece, depending on what insulation, circuitry and materials are used.

2002 The San Francisco Chronicle SAN FRANCISCO -- How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? 
The show, along with her seminal book, "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. 
First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded).

The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. 
She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex. 
She thinks it's selfish for people not to make arrangements for their old age in good time." But so far, age has been kind to the ebullient Child. 
Though she had a "nice" kitchen installed in her new home, Child said it's like a ship's galley -- a far cry from the huge, three-pantry kitchen Paul Child designed for their house in Cambridge. 
"Back there, we always ate in the kitchen," Child reminisced, "I cannot do that here." That means her entertaining has been curtailed, even though she still has an active social life with the many friends the Childs made during 22 winters spent in Santa Barbara. 
One of its Peg-Board walls was dismantled and reinstalled at COPIA; the rest went to Washington, D.C., and the Behring Center of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. 
As reinstalled in Washington, the kitchen should be as we all remember it from countless TV shows, "right down to the toothpicks." Child will go to the capital for the debut of the exhibit right after the Maine birthday bash.

Most say they're driven by the desire to do right by the environment. 
The nationwide boycott of Chilean seabass is a potent example of the new activism. 
"I refuse to sell it." Chilean seabass, also known as Patagonian toothfish, came into vogue in the 1990s in U.S. 
With rising demand for the firm, oil-rich fish came pirate fishing fleets eager to cash in on its popularity -- even if it meant skirting catch limits and environmental regulations. 
But more than 32,000 tons may have been taken illegally from those same waters, the fisheries service said. 
A number of restaurants not officially part of the National Environmental Trust boycott also have stopped serving Chilean seabass. 
Red Lobster, with 660 restaurants in the United States and Canada, dropped Chilean seabass from the menu in the past year because of "sustainability" concerns, said Wendy Spirduso, communications director for the Orlando, Fla.-based chain. 
"We've discontinued selling swordfish, Chilean seabass, orange roughy and marlin," said Mark Cockcroft, national seafood buyer for Wild Oats Markets, a chain of 103 stores. 
All of this comes at a time when Americans are consuming more seafood: 15 to 16 pounds per person each year, compared with 10.3 pounds per person in 1960 and 12.5 pounds in 1980, according to the National Fisheries Institute, an industry association. 
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reports that 47 percent to 50 percent of stocks are "fully exploited," meaning that catches have either reached or are close to maximum limits. 
Fisheries management is best left to the experts, said Thor Lassen, president of Ocean Trust, a research and conservation foundation partly financed by the fishing industry. 
In 2000 and 2001, the Packard Foundation awarded $26 million in marine fisheries conservation grants. 
More than $7 million was given to projects aimed at educating the general public. 
More than 600,000 of the cards and seafood guides have been distributed since 2000, said Jennifer Dianto, Seafood Watch program manager at the aquarium. 
But in a business in which 12-hour shifts are the norm, some chefs worry about their lack of time to stay informed about complicated, rapidly changing fisheries management issues. 
"For me, it's very difficult to be certain that the information which is given to me is real," said Eric Ripert, chef at Le Bernardin, a four-star seafood restaurant in Manhattan.

Davison of the University of Southern California. 
A total of 31 state psychology associations have task forces dedicated to developing and lobbying for prescription-privileges legislation. 
Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other prescribers, such as M.D. 
Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt the efficacy of medications. 
In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind, mood and behavior can be studied empirically, the past decade, Davison says, has seen "exciting developments" that demonstrate the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the psychosocial-behavioral models on which they are based.

More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology, RxP opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they love. 
Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design and evaluation. 
The 300-member SSCP is the only group within the APA to have taken a formal stance against prescription privileges. 
"Except for this small vocal minority, we have just not gotten a lot of groundswell against this from members," says APA president Philip G. 
With prescription privileges now a reality in one state, some RxP opponents concede that it may be too late.

He was tracking down men to join a group so secret he couldn't admit it existed. 
He was calling bases all over the United States to line up their transfer to the desert outside Salt Lake City. 
"Who says this?" another commanding officer asked Karnes. 
"This is a Silverplate request," he said. 
Almost 1,800 men were assembled n late 1944 to join the top-secret unit called the 509th Composite Group. 
Paul Tibbets, the pilot who would drop the world's first atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Japan, was commander of the unit and chose the men. 
Tibbets picked the names, and Karnes made it happen. 
The story of the 509th is a tale of an elite outfit that lived in a bubble of secrecy and endured the taunts of other war-weary U.S. 
Tinian Island was the staging area where the 509th moved after its creation in the desert. 
He never even told his story to students in his 40 years of teaching college. 
He earned a doctorate in history from Stanford University and taught Latin American history at Tulane University and Arizona State University. 
6, "I always think of Paul Tibbets and how he handled unbelievable responsibility," Karnes said. 
Tibbets had just been ordered to organize a combat force to drop a bomb being developed by a secret enterprise known as the Manhattan Project. 
Tibbets instantly liked the isolation and vast size of Wendover and the surrounding Bonneville Salt Flats. 
In Karnes, Tibbets found a kindred spirit -- and a handball partner. 
Each had skills the other admired. 
"I don't recall ever having to tell Tom to do anything," Tibbets said in an e-mail this week. 
I was very lucky to have Tom." Tibbets quickly returned to Wendover after that first visit to set up his headquarters. 
Almost overnight, Wendover became a high-security base filled with off-limit areas covered in barbed wire. 
Karnes and his staff read outgoing mail to make sure no secrets slipped out. 
Phone calls were monitored. 
Karnes knew the 509th was preparing for a special bombing mission, but he had no idea what kind of bombs were involved. 
He said that they had split the atom and that we were going to drop an atomic bomb," Karnes said. 
The 509th took North Field and stayed in relative isolation from other B-29 units on the island. 
Karnes had his own Jeep, and went to the beach and to evening movies shown by other units as often as he could. 
Not until the day before Tibbets and his crew flew to Hiroshima was the 509th told what was happening. 
This is the big mission." Karnes and hundreds of other men from the 509th stood along the flight line as Tibbets and the Enola Gay took off at 2:45 a.m. 
As they approached, Tibbets braced for Japanese anti-aircraft fire. 
Early in the flight, the crew had inserted a plug of uranium into the 9,000-pound bomb, nicknamed "Little Boy." Ninety seconds from the bomb drop, Tibbets put the plane on auto-pilot. 
At 8:15 a.m. 
Tibbets and his crew had exactly 43 seconds to get away before the bomb exploded. 
He pushed off the dark glasses because he couldn't see to fly. 
More shocking was the city of Hiroshima, which was on fire and bubbling like tar. 
But he didn't sleep long. 
Carl Spaatz, commander of the Strategic Air Forces, stepped forward to pin the medal on his bomb flight coveralls. 
He knew the war would soon be over and he would be heading home. 
Three days later, another B-29 from the 509th bombed Nagasaki. 
Today, Karnes is frustrated that some of his fellow historians, the ones he calls "revisionists," question the wisdom and morality of the bombings. 
"We were not bloodthirsty guys," he said. 
And what the casualties would have been, who knows -- but heavy." "On Tinian, and probably elsewhere, the Seabees were building enormous hospitals while we were there," he said. 
They were for (an expected invasion of Japan). 
In his heart, he holds the unshakable conviction that the mission he helped organize saved America from disaster.

Separately, Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.3 million, or 68 cents a share, versus net income of $5.3 million, or $1.61 a share, a year earlier. 
Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition, which was terminated on Sept. 
In addition, operating results were hit by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves. 
Reed International PLC said that net income for the six months ended Oct. 
And while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations, last year they contributed #34 million, before tax. 
Reed is paying an interim dividend of 4.6 pence, up 15% from 4 pence a year earlier. 
Earnings were hurt by disposal of operations in its restructuring, Reed said. 
DSM said net income in the third quarter jumped 63% as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program. 
The 32% state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter, mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations. 
Last year, DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions. 
Also, substantially lower Dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth, the company added. 
The Rockford, Ill., maker of fasteners also said it expects to post sales in the current fiscal year that are "slightly above" fiscal 1989 sales of $155 million. 
In fiscal 1989, Elco earned $7.8 million, or $1.65 a share. 
Oshkosh Truck Corp., Oshkosh, Wis., estimated earnings for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 
The truck maker said the significant drop in net income will result in lower earnings for the fiscal year. 
Oshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division, a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations. 
In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory, the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period. 
But revenue declined to $3 billion from $3.2 billion. 
The insurer's earnings from commercial property/casualty lines fell 59% in the latest quarter, while it lost $7.2 million in its personal property/casualty business, compared with earnings of $6.1 million a year ago. 
In the first nine months, net was $306 million, compared with a loss of $195 million in the 1988 period.

Its subsidiaries' services are marketed by closely held A.L. 
Primerica, as expected, also acquired certain assets of the agency and assumed certain of its liabilities. 
Intelogic Trace Inc., San Antonio, Texas, said it bought 2.7 million shares, or about 18%, of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $3.625 a share, or $9.9 million. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $2.75. 
Edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves, saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when "the company is on a roll." He added, "This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed, particularly, to take the company private." But Mr.

A Physics of Semantics? 
Each is tentative and incomplete, pointing but not fully adequate. 
the darkness? 
There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries, to doubt a physics of semantics. 
Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn, long-legged, knowing how winter is thin, when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found. 
The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom, and perhaps more than the vaunted quark. 
If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a usefulor more, a properdefinition of life itself, then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where "purpose" is ascribed by all of us to one another. 
For this to be true, it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose, say, the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient, be conscious. 
Know-how Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now, plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material. 
Indeed, as I have emphasized before, a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents, ways of making a living, and the search procedures, mutation, recombination, as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents. 
There is in this whole self-constructing system a wider know-how, beyond the know-how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment. 
There is no autonomous agent, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations. 
Philosophers distinguish between "know-how" and "know that." I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums. 
I know that the moon isthey tell menot made of green cheese. 
"Know that" brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world. 
Unlike "know that," "know-how" does not involve propositions about the world. 
The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest, the athletic genius high jumping, have the know-how to do it. 
I certainly want to say yes, without attributing consciousness in any way. 
It knows how all right, even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business. 
Thank God for know-how. 
But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how. 
The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents. 
The know-how is the propagating organization. 
It is simple at its roots, you see. 
S. 
Like it or not, the glucose gradient is a sign, a predictor, of "more glucose that way." Granted, the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol, any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain. 
By contrast, the relation between the word "chair" and that which it signifies, and on which I am now sitting, is arbitrary. 
If so, can "mere chemicals" be signs in the full Piercean sense? 
The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached, the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids, the binding of the charged transfer RNA's anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet, the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm, tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is "translated." The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules, which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid. 
Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site, the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis. 
Because of this, which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging, plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA. 
In short, chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations. 
It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling, chemical and otherwise, within and between autonomous agents, as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that "warns" other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites. 
Nowhere in the core of Shannon's work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning, or semantics, of the information enter. 
There is, however, just a hint of semantics in Shannon's view that the semantics resides in the "decoder." I cannot buy Shannon's view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent. 
The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding. 
If only the bacterium could tell us: "Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me? 
I ducked under a boulder, and he never sensed me. 
Pass me some more glucose please, Martha." I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories, for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and, therefore, cannot deduce that which will unfold. 
Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing. 
But patience. 
The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system. 
Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological. 
Now, five chapters later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter, energy, and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf. 
On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like F = MA and Darwin's "natural selection" and "fitness," that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world. 
All living cells are.

I find his hierarchy congenial and informative. 
I do not disagree, although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization in evolution. 
I wonder, in short, at the naturalness and self-generaticity of Dennett's cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres, perhaps planetary geologies, and beyond. 
Dennett distinguishes "Darwinian creatures," "Pavlovian creatures," "Popperian creatures," and "Gregorian creatures." A simple autonomous agent, say, a bacterium, is a Darwinian creature. 
For the moment, no behavioral learning is to be considered. 
At the next level up, say, aplysia, a nervous system is present, and the creature is capable of stimulus-response learning, á la Pavlov. 
Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our toolsliterally stone knives, arrows, digging sticks, machine toolsto enlarge our shared world of facts and processes. 
Cultural evolution, at some point, begins to burst out-of-bounds. 
Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom? 
I very much like Dennett's ladder of know-how, and eventual know that. 
This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter. 
Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self-sustaining web linking the carbohydrates, the enzymes, and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus, then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops. 
In such networks, for which there is modestly good evidence, a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences, called the "idiotype" of the first antibody. 
But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody, hence, the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space. 
Popperian creatures? 
There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect, just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified. 
I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures. 
If the conversation we recent two-legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive, so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem, where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another. 
We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e-mail, I guess. 
Four billion years of yammering. 
Ethics And what of ethics? 
Hume told us long ago about the "naturalistic fallacy": One cannot deduce "ought" from "is." From the fact that mothers care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, Hume argued. 
You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics. 
Hume's injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category "ought." The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous. 
E. 
"It is wrong to kill." Becomes, "Agggah!" Does the positivist argument seem persuasive? 
One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards. 
Thus "equality before the law" is one contract that Rawls commends to us. 
Where is the place of value in a world of fact? 
Facts are know-that statements. 
Too much yuck, this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere. 
coli , or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around. 
If so, another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid. 
But what are "acts" in the first place? 
Now entering Harvard, Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive, after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard, where, at age fourteen, Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands. 
Note we say the E. 
But all sorts of molecular vibrational, rotational, and translational motions are occurring. 
I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics. 
Strange and interesting, is it not, that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise? 
I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Hume's naturalistic fallacy. 
The word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem, and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style. 
In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, he describes the zoot--suiters’ style, “walking slowly, their shoulders swaying, their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles; their coats long and hip-tight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men” (1947, 380). 
Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume, which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing. 
The long baggy pants were made for dancing, especially the jitterbug, and the wide Panama hats were another sign of adulthood. 
It was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of free-wheeling movement in the city among youths in the new youth culture” (Tyler, 23). 
Ellington performed at the Orpheum in Los Angeles in 1941 and 1942 with a musical called Jump for Joy in which the performers wore zoot suits, also known as Gone with the Wind suits, after the style worn by Clark Gable in the movie by the same name. 
Pachucos were mostly second-generation Mexicans, the sons of migrant laborers and working-class immigrants. 
The zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zoot-suiter as neither a Mexican nor an American. 
The overly confident, slow swagger of the pachuco, today exemplified by the cholo, made it appear in fact as if the zoot-suiter were walking on air. 
It is unclear if this was a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked, beat, and stripped young Mexican Americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zoot-suiters. 
Much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectives. 
In 1981 a film by the same name, Zoot Suit, was produced and directed by Luis Valdez, with performances by actors Daniel Valdez and Edward James Olmos. 
In 1969 Shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of Zozobra to the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe. 
The death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happiness. 
Deformation and river response Before specific examples of syntectonic impacts on alluvial rivers can be discussed, a brief review of types of tectonic activity, types of rivers, and river response will be presented. 
Types of deformation The surficial movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. 
Faults may be lateral faults that displace or offset the channel (Figure 2.1A) without vertical displacement. 
Faults with vertical displacement may have the uplifted block upstream of the fault with the result that gradient is steepened (Figure 2.1B). 
This has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and synclines (Figure 2.1H, I). 
When the displacement produces a channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient (Figure 2.1B), erosion will be initiated in this reach. 
Even small displacements may be sufficient to induce aggradation or degradation of large streams. 
Wallace (1968) mentioned that even a few inches of vertical upthrow along the downstream side of a fault can produce a dam across a small stream, which can divert its course. 
Plan view on left; cross-section on right (from Ouchi, 1983) small arrows indicate direction of flow. 
There will be aggradation upstream from the horst, and degradation, which will migrate upstream, on the downstream part of the horst. 
Upstream of the graben, there will be degradation and aggradation in the graben itself. 
The type of folding (Figure 2.1) will affect a river similar to the various types of faulting, but changes will probably be less abrupt. 
Lateral tilting will cause channel shift downdip (Figure 2.1J) or avulsion. 
For example, small stream channels have been offset by strike-slip movement (Figures 1.8, 2.1A) of the San Andreas fault. 
The main reason why channel offset caused by the San Andreas fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault (20.3 mm/year, Brown and Wallace, 1968) and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault. 
Types of alluvial rivers It is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently to deformation; therefore, their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can be evaluated. 
Five basic channel patterns exist (Figure 2.2): (1) straight channels with either migrating sand waves; or (2) with migrating alternate bars forming a sinuous thalweg; (3) two types of meandering channels, a highly sinuous channel of equal width (pattern 3a) and channels that are wider at bends than in crossings (pattern 3b); (4) the meandering–braided transition; and (5) a typical braided stream. 
It has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying the gradient, sediment load, stream power, and the type of sediment load transported by the channel (Schumm and Kahn, 1972). 
The mixed-load channel lies between these two (Figure 2.2). 
In addition, in the braided-stream category, there are bar-braided and island-braided channels (islands are vegetated bars). 
The pattern changes take place at critical values of stream power, gradient, and sediment load (Schumm and Kahn, 1972). 
Sediment load, stream power, velocity increase with flume slope and a similar relation can be developed with these variables (from Schumm and Khan, 1972). 
158). 
Patterns 1–5 are bed-load channel patterns, patterns 6–10 are mixed-load channel patterns, and patterns 11–13 are suspended-load channel patterns. 
The three major river types are controlled by type of sediment load, but within each type, the different patterns reflect increased valley slope, sediment load, and stream power. 
Pattern 2, alternate-bar channel with migrating side or alternate bars and a slightly sinuous thalweg; Pattern 3, low-sinuosity meandering channel with large alternate bars that develop chutes; Pattern 4, transitional meandering-thalweg braided channel. 
Pattern 5 is a typical bar-braided channel. 
The higher degree of bank stability permits the maintenance of narrow, deep, straight channels (Pattern 6), and alternate bars stabilize because of the finer sediments to form slightly sinuous channels (Pattern 7). 
Pattern 9 maintains the sinuosity of a meandering channel, but with a greater sediment transport the presence of bars gives it a composite sinuous-braided appearance. 
Suspended load Pattern 11 is a straight, narrow, deep channel. 
This is the anastomosing pattern of branching and rejoining channel segments (Schumm et al., 1996). 
Anastomosing or anabranching channels differ from braided channels because they are composed of multiple channels that are separated by a floodplain (Figure 2.5), whereas braided channels have multiple thalwegs in a single channel. 
(1993) suggest that this pattern is transitioned to a single channel because anastomosing rivers appear to be associated with partly blocked valleys (Smith and Smith, 1980) and tectonic uplift (Gregory and Schumm, 1987). 
Evidence of deformation The first geomorphic clues of active tectonics may be tectonic landforms that result from long-continued deformation such as modified drainage networks and deformed sets of terraces. 
For example, experimental studies demonstrated that parallel drainage patterns form on slopes greater than about 2.5 percent, whereas dendritic patterns form on gentler slopes (Phillips and Schumm, 1987). 
Numbers indicate relative ages of channels and reaches of channels from youngest (1) to oldest (4) (from Schumm et al., 1996). 
A topographic high caused by active uplift, will cause a deflection of portions of the drainage pattern. 
This can cause portions of the drainage pattern to develop in a direction opposite to that of the drainage network. 
As the major streams are deflected away from the uplift, tributaries on one side will be lengthened and those on the other side will be shortened. 
Incision of the steepened streams permitted them to capture the streams that were aggrading as a result of reduced gradient. 
NULL Figure 2.6 Drainage pattern modified by uplift. 
Subsidence caused southward migration of east–west flowing channels. 
Muehlberger (1979) noted this type of asymmetry in an area near Taos, New Mexico (Figure 2.7). 
Geological Survey topographic 2 maps, he described this asymmetry quantitatively. 
The index for 30 small drainage basins was 0.6 indicating a major displacement of the main channel in a down-tilt direction. 
Other indices of asymmetry are described by Keller and Pinter (1996, pp.

They occur at various scales, along primary or secondary portions of the drainage network, and generally disappear as erosion and deposition occurs through time. 
Isolated lakes are generally due to local events such as landslides or collapses, which form a dam, but clustered lakes are due to regional processes, which may be related to climate (or paleoclimate), neotectonic deformation, or frequently a combination of these processes. 
Such lakes act as drainage collectors and they can occupy various elevations. 
Continental stretching and transtensional tectonics are favorable for the formation of basins and tectonic lakes. 
The river trace and ria lakes suggest a downward movement along the same axis as that of the inferred fault. 
Most of these concepts are not new. 
Ria Lakes Dendritic ria lakes occur at the lower part of a tributary, which is blocked by aggradation along the trunk river (Holz et al., 1979). 
Some of these lakes have a “knee” pattern superposed on the dendritic pattern suggesting the effect of active faulting through a thick sedimentary cover (Sternberg, 1950, 1955, Figure 2.8). 
Stars show the location of the main ria lakes, with the area A represented in detail. 
Section along X–Y in the lower part of the figure, modified after Laurent (1985). 
Clusters of ria lakes are observed along large rivers in the western Marañón Basin and in the central Ucayali Basin, Peru (Räsänen et al., 1987; Dumont, 1993). 
Similar patterns are observed on the south margin of the Beni Basin (Dumont, 1992; Dumont and Guyot, 1993). 
This cluster is superimposed over the structural axis of the basin, which trends toward the Ucamara Depression. 
NULL Figure 2.10 Relative positions of tectonic lakes in the Peruvian foreland basins. 
The Pastaza depression is filled by more than 4 500 m of Cretaceous and Cenozoic sediments, with about 500 m of Quaternary sediment (Laurent, 1985) (Figure 2.9). 
A continental rift generates tilt of the side blocks in opposite directions and the progressive tilting of the earth’s surface can significantly modify the gradient of rivers. 
Lake Kyoga and Lake Kwania look artificial, but they are not the result of dam construction. 
Flow in the Kafu River has been reversed, and water draining from Lake Victoria has found a new course to the north, where it flows over Murchison Falls and into Lake Albert. 
Back tilting explains the shape of Lake Kyoga and Lake Kwania (modified after Doornkamp and Temple, 1966). 
These lakes are superimposed over basement structures. 
The Puinahua (1324 km2) and Punga (341 km2) lakes are both located in the south part of the Marañón Basin (Figure 2.10). 
Punga Lake is superimposed over the structure of the Santa Elena uplift (Dumont and Garcia, 1991), which is interpreted as a crystalline horst surrounded by Paleozoic sedimentary strata (Laurent, 1985). 
Both lakes are also parallel to the strike of normal faulting with a NNW–SSE extension in the upland border (Dumont et al., 1988). 
More precise morphological evidence of active tectonics comes from the Punga Lake. 
Then the region began to subside. 
Only a downward motion of the area where the lake is observed can explain the phenomenon. 
An example is the isostatic deformation of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville shorelines, Utah (Crittenden, 1963). 
In addition, deformed marine terraces provide an excellent indication of recent deformation along 440 km of the Pacific Coast of Baja, California (Orme, 1980). 
This will, of course, dramatically alter the hydraulics and hydrology of the reach. 
NULL Figure 2.12 Block diagram of the displaced river terraces at the mouth of the Waiohine Gorge, New Zealand. 
The amount (in feet) each terrace has been moved by the fault is indicated (H = amount of horizontal movement; V = amount of vertical movement). 
In addition, the variations of thickness and distribution of recent sediments indicate the variability of tectonics in a given valley. 
Alluvial rivers will be very sensitive indicators of valley slope change. 
For example, Twidale (1966) reported that both the Flinders and Leichardt Rivers have changed to a braided pattern, as a result of the steepening of their gradient by the Selwyn Upwarp in northern Queensland, Australia; and the Red River near Winnipeg, Canada is straightening, as a result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound (Welch, 1973). 
Louis and Cairo and the lower Missouri River (Adams, 1980) as well as the Red River of the North near Winnipeg, Canada (Vanicek and Nagy, 1980). 
For example, if sea-level is lowered, and a steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed, the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift. 
Indeed, Lane’s (1955) argument that a stream will restore its gradient at a higher or lower level following a baselevel change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade, then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel, the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished. 
It has been demonstrated that rivers can respond to major changes of water and sediment load primarily by pattern changes (Schumm, 1968), and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial rivers such as the Mississippi, Indus, and Nile, reflect the variability of the valley slope (Schumm et al., 1994; Jorgensen et al., 1993; Schumm and Galay, 1994). 
See text for discussion. 
The line A–C represents the channel profile, and the line A–B represents the profile of the valley floor. 
The channel distance is one-third longer than the valley distance, and the difference in channel and valley slope reflects the sinuosity of the stream. 
In this case, incision ceases at point F in the valley and at point G in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from 1.5 to 2.0 from G to H maintains a constant channel gradient over the reach of increased valley slope (F–D). 
According to Lane’s assumptions, the effect of this baselevel fall would be propagated upstream to point A, where an amount of erosion equal to B–D would occur. 
Rather the channel lengthens, and the effect of baselevel lowering is propagated only a relatively short distance upstream. 
The probability that a large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the baselevel changes in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly, unlike during the experimental studies. 
This change would have doubled the channel gradient. 
It is clear, however, that pattern change did not totally compensate for the change of baselevel. 
Ware’s experiments showed that a sinuosity increase, which resulted in a slope decrease, was only part of the adjustment, and width, depth, and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power. 
The River Nile provides an example of such shared adjustment with both sinuosity and width changing as valley slope changes (Schumm and Galay, 1994). 
Tectonic activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel pattern (Adams, 1980). 
The Jordan River, as it approaches one of these convexities, straightens as it crosses the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it develops a more sinuous course on the steeper downstream side of the fan (Schumm, 1977, p. 
It is important to realize that channels that lie near a pattern threshold (Figure 2.3) may change their characteristics dramatically with only a slight change in the controlling variable. 
For example, with increasing slope, a straight channel will become sinuous, a low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous, and a meandering channel will braid. 
NULL Figure 2.14 Reaches of degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and faulting. 
In fact, upstream deposition will reduce downstream sediment loads thereby increasing the tendency for downstream erosion. 
For example, deposition upstream from the axis of a dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation (Figure 2.14). 
However, it is more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion on the steeper downstream reach, and when this increased load moves downstream, aggradation will result (Figure 2.14). 
The result should be deformed or compressed meanders upstream and a change of meander character at the contact. 
Hence, a fault may present a barrier with the result that upstream meanders are compressed and deformed (Figure 2.15). 
Rivers being the most sensitive components of the landscape will provide evidence of even, slow, aseismic tectonic activity.

effects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation (degradation, aggradation, flooding, bank erosion) 8. 
Therefore, it may be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when, in fact, human activities have been changing both discharge and sediment load during historic time. 
In many areas, the evidence will be circumstantial. 
Lakes can also provide information on subsidence, and ria lakes can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic influences. 
Therefore, care must be exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies. 
Whyte Jr’s (1956) ‘organization man’ to walk permanently out of the front doors of the corporation, many of the assumptions of a traditional career path followed shortly behind. 
Is there anything that can be concluded about careers if everyone seems to be doing their own thing? 
The new environment suggests a shift from pre-ordained and linear development to perpetually changing career paths and possibilities. 
The concept of the boundaryless career is broadly based, and intended to reflect the emergent pace of economic change. 
6). 
So much so, that one may be tempted to think that no aggregates can be drawn from this seemingly random micro-level behaviour. 
For these people and industries the ‘boundaryless career’ is simply business as usual. 
We focus in this chapter on situations where boundaryless career practices appear to be well established and fruitful, involving industries where open labour markets have thrived. 
Further examination reveals not only order, but remarkable stability. 
Moreover, the resulting social interdependence provides a new form of cohesiveness that, in turn, introduces new structure. 
It is organising, rather than organisation, that is the catch-word of the boundaryless career. 
We present a theoretical perspective through which we can understand the dynamics of boundaryless careers followed by descriptive analysis demonstrating evidence of theory in practice in two selected industries. 
We then examine the industry cases. 
His conception of enactment, directly related to his previous (1995) work on sensemaking, explains the dynamics of the characteristic interdependence that operates in boundaryless careers. 
That is, people create situations and understandings out of their own dispositions and backgrounds. 
People enact laws, which become part of the legal system which in turn influences further behaviour, leading people to enact new laws, and so on. 
Similarly, career systems evolve from the enactment of individual careers. 
133). 
If enactment is ‘saying’ then it is, in essence, the action of individuals in their environment that starts the process. 
For example, if you believe a certain group of individuals to be hostile, when you interact with them your behaviour may reflect your fear. 
The environment becomes hostile. 
The result is a circular self-reinforcing relationship resembling a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
How do we relate this process to boundaryless careers? 
In traditional bounded organisations and careers the proliferation of structure, hierarchy, plans, detailed job descriptions, prescribed relationships, and established ‘road maps’ provide an armoury of articulated rules and social cues to guide behaviour. 
In the pure form of the boundaryless career, however, such explicit guides do not exist. 
‘Weak’ situations fall short of providing sufficient incentives for consistent behaviour or even similar expectations for those operating within them (Mischel, 1968). 
People engage in a stable process of trial and error that resembles an evolutionary system (Weick, 1979). 
In the process ‘microstrength shapes macroweaknesses’ (Weick, 1996, p. 
To illustrate the preceding argument we will apply Weick’s ideas to descriptions provided by AnnaLee Saxenian (1996) on the dynamics of the Silicon Valley and by Candace Jones (1996) on the independent film industry. 
To show how enactment and associated principles of self-organising and learning come to life, we will trace the process of enactment in each setting. 
Next, we will cite some of the characteristics that make the resulting circumstances ‘weak’. 
Finally, we will point out the patterns, order, and shape we see enactment bringing to each of these respective settings. 
The Silicon Valley The Silicon Valley is notorious for the individual and collective success of its firms. 
The region is regarded as the centre for excellence and innovation and has given rise to some of the world’s most influential firms, including Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Intel. 
Today, the learning advantages that emanate from associated boundaryless career behaviour are regarded as a key source of competitive advantage for the region (Saxenian, 1996). 
However, other industry clusters and several notable large electronics firms do not engage with boundaryless practices. 
. 
‘‘If you want to succeed here you need to be willing to do three things: change jobs often, talk to your competitors and take risks – even if it means failing’’ ’ (Saxenian, 1996, p. 
Hewlett was himself influenced by his Stanford Dean of Engineering William Terman, a mentor and an influential Hewlett Packard board member (Collins & Porras, 1995). 
Despite fierce inter-firm competition, open information exchange is common practice among the region’s producers. 
23). 
Average job tenure is in the area of two years, and annual turnover is around 35%, and often higher for smaller firms (Saxenian, 1996). 
Everyone knows that, upon leaving a company, they may well work together again in the future: ‘A colleague might become a customer or a competitor; today’s boss could be tomorrow’s subordinate’ (Saxenian, p. 
Institutionally based hierarchy, therefore, loses its saliency. 
In the context of this ‘weak’ environment, clear social behaviour emerges as structure gets built at the micro-level. 
Learning takes place in the pub or club. 
Now it takes place in one of many watering holes or hobby groups where the Valley’s high-technology workers regularly meet for lunch or after work. 
Workers have a systemic commitment to technical excellence in their field. 
26) As one local manager claimed: ‘‘‘Over a lunch conversation or a beer, you’ll learn that company A or company B has a technology you want . 
Such self-generated guides are reinforced by professional social networks, which provide a tacit road map about who knows who and who does what in the industry. 
As one engineer reported: ‘‘‘You don’t just hire people out of the blue. 
27). 
It is the region and its relationships, rather than the firm, that define opportunities for individual and collective advances in Silicon Valley (Saxenian, 1996). 
Knowledge of the latest techniques in design, production, and marketing is diffused rapidly throughout the area. 
‘Ironically, many of these Silicon Valley job hoppers may well have led more stable lives than the upwardly mobile ‘‘organizational men’’ of the 1950s who were transferred from place to place by the same employer’ (Saxenian, p. 
These activities evolved in the wake of fierce competition posed by the proliferation of television and the need to cut fixed costs. 
The uncertainty of the market stems from the fact that production of any particular film revolves around whether or not sufficient financing is obtained to start and ultimately complete production of any given film. 
The limited duration of the project is such that all resources, including human resources, are temporary. 
At this time, the film’s credits symbolise that those who made it have moved on to other assignments. 
Studios combine with subcontractors for specific film projects and disband when the work is done. 
Each time a film is completed the whole process starts over again and employment relationships are re-negotiated. 
The industry is a magnet for talented, committed workers eager for work on the industry’s terms. 
However, as with Silicon Valley high-technology projects, much of the work is economically ‘clustered’, thereby facilitating fluidity of movement from one challenge to another. 
At the ‘beginning’ stage, freelance employees are constantly vying to participate in an industry in which there are no clear rules for entry. 
You have to find people you like who make movies . 
. 
62). 
In the words of one film commissioner, ‘‘‘We are a big industry but a small industry because we talk to one another’’’ (Jones, 1996, p. 
It is through talking to each other that people gain access to experiences that both hone existing abilities and cultivate more complex skills. 
Here, senior members of the industry identify and train new members, establish workshops that develop talent in the field, and co-ordinate events such as film festivals. 
In a ‘weak’ environment that lasts a lifetime, it is critical that non-bureaucratic forms of cohesion bring order to the industry. 
Learning accumulates, disperses, and evolves as industry specialists enact their working environment. 
In the process of enacting their careers, individuals engage in reinforcing the cohesive social patterns of the industry which serve to guide the stages of their development. 
Just as careers can be traced in the Valley through the development of technology and tightly knit project teams, in film a clear pattern also emerges that reveals micro-level organising shaping macro activity. 
Marshall (1989), after Bakan (1966), refers to the elements in this mixture as agency and communion. 
Agency is individualistic, and characterised by autonomy, independence, initiative, and adaptation. 
Communion, in contrast to agency, is concerned about connections, relationships, tolerance, and trust. 
Communion provides the platform for mutual support and collective learning through which shared visions may be pursued. 
The Silicon Valley and independent film-making examples illustrate the interplay of agency and communion. 
Together, the combination of behaviours supports current high-technology or film-making projects while it simultaneously develops people for further opportunities. 
Host industries will thrive, our examples suggest, as long as agency and communion are allowed to work in tandem (Rousseau & Arthur, 1999). 
However, in calling for a return to community, these views frequently look no further than the single company. 
Both the Silicon Valley and film-making stories demonstrate that host industries, as well as their embedded occupations, provide alternative contexts for community-building to occur. 
1 Some researchers, notably Marshall (1989), emphasise the feminine characteristics of communion versus the masculine characteristics of agency. 
Reciprocity refers to the connection between what people give to and what people take from their employment situations. 
Accordingly, deferred pension rights, vacation time, promotion opportunities, and social acceptance were most reserved for those who had ‘served their time’. 
The Silicon Valley and film-making worlds suggest a different logic: one where the old entitlement-based models are a hindrance to boundaryless career investments. 
In the simplest case, employment arrangements reflect a ‘spot’ contract involving a simple exchange of work for immediate financial payment. 
Work which provides an underlying project-based structure, such as in construction (‘jobs’), law (cases), or computing (programmes), provides a particular time span for reciprocities to occur. 
Yet, the benefits of reciprocity can accrue beyond the project’s conclusion. 
Meanwhile, their influence on other project participants can be retained in the sponsoring company, or the host industry, or both. 
A new continuity What general lessons can be claimed from our two examples? 
We agree, but we also live in a time when those systems are failing, and where their underlying assumptions of stasis are incompatible with the emergent reality of persistent change. 
Yet, it is the conception of intellectual capital that is increasingly emphasised today. 
Is it really too great a step to extend the same belief in the capacity for learning to the workforce at large? 
Having people trapped by deferred rewards (Williamson, 1975), or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust? 
She asked what was the single best thing a Czech worker could do to learn the underlying principles of the market. 
Today’s work is increasingly ‘intelligent’ work (Quinn, 1992), that calls on workers’ learning capacities, and – as our examples suggest – provides an organising structure rich in project opportunities through which learning episodes can unfold. 
In the future, we submit, most careers will be boundaryless. 
As they take charge, boundaries will form and re-form, and underlying order provide a macro-economic stability in an environment in which ‘organization man’ has become all but extinct.

John Shaw Billings, the library’s executive director, was determined that in his building, design would not triumph over function. 
He drafted a plan for the new library whose most unorthodox feature was the location of the main reading room. 
The terms of the architectural competition were strict and included detailed floor plans that the competitors were required to follow. 
First, six architects were chosen from an open competition. 
Post, and an up-and-coming young firm, Carrère & Hastings. 
McKim, much to his chagrin, not only lost but placed third behind Howard & Cauldwell. 
Carrère & Hastings conscientiously followed Billings’ requirements. 
All three designs were monumental. 
All incorporated giant columns rising the full height of the two floors—Corinthian in McKim’s case, Ionic in the other two (the completed building is Corinthian). 
The library board had conducted a national search for an architect, visited new libraries across the country, and solicited proposals from prominent architects. 
Moshe Safdie had built major civic buildings in Israel, Canada, and the United States, and recently completed the public library in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
Will Bruder, the least well-known of the four, is a southwesterner and the architect of the new, well-regarded Phoenix Public Library. 
It was not a question of function. 
As for firmness, I was reasonably sure that any of these experienced firms would build soundly. 
Gwathmey and Siegel design crisply detailed, understated buildings in a latter-day version of the International Style. 
Moore Ruble Yudell’s work is different. 
Bruder, on the other hand, designs chic buildings that incorporate exposed structural elements, rough industrial materials, and sleek details. 
A hundred years ago, it was taken for granted that the New York Public Library would be designed in some variant of the Classical style. 
The coexistence of different architectural styles is nothing new. 
Two were new: steel-frame construction, which Cram described as an enfant terrible; and what he called the Secessionists—Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago, the Greene brothers in Pasadena—who exhibited “a strongly developed enmity to archaeological forms of any kind.” Cram was not sanguine about the future, but he nevertheless concluded: “Chaos then confronts us, in that there is no single architectural following, but legion; and in that fact lies the honor of our art, for neither is society one, or ever at one with itself.”3 Cram is right: most historical periods are marked by stylistic confusion; it is stylistic consensus that is unusual. 
That unanimity lasted long enough for the New York Public Library competition, but it began to unravel shortly after, as Cram’s essay makes clear. 
That consensus did not last either. 
In the 1920s, Le Corbusier proclaimed the “Five Points of a New Architecture”: the building raised on stilts; the roof garden; the frame structure that allowed a free plan; the free façade; and the horizontal ribbon window. 
This volte face gave rise to the so-called Brutalist style, which had a worldwide influence, shaping the work of architects as dissimilar as James Stirling and Paul Rudolph, and ultimately opening the door to Postmodern stylistic experiments such as Charles Moore’s little house in the Berkeley hills. 
The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules, only to bend and break them. 
As far as we know, the ancient Greeks used only three orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. 
Roman, too, is the so-called Composite order, an ornate blend of Ionic and Corinthian. 
Architects have been stretching Classical rules ever since: breaking pediments, flattening pilasters, magnifying and shrinking columns, rusticating masonry. 
Michael Graves designed Classical caryatids (columns carved in the shape of human figures) to support the pedimented front of an office building for the Walt Disney Company in Burbank. 
The headquarters of a company whose logo is a pair of mouse ears obviously demands a different decorum from a temple. 
As architectural commissions grew to include civic and commercial buildings, warehouses, factories, shops and cinemas, houses and weekend houses—every sort of building—a single style no longer sufficed. 
Shingle Style cottages are pleasing; a Shingle Style Home Depot is ridiculous. 
At first glance, the Smith House has all the stylistic hallmarks of a Le Corbusier villa of the 1920s: a free plan, flat roof, white walls, pipe railings, horizontal ribbon windows, a ramp. 
The white walls are painted wood siding, not stucco; the details are more refined, the plate-glass sheets are larger, the structure lighter. 
It is like Thomas Jefferson building Classical columns out of wood—the same, but different. 
“For the serious architect the past exists not as a legacy to be possessed through a self-conscious act of the ‘modern’ will,” writes Roger Scruton in The Aesthetics of Architecture, “but as an enduring fact, an ineliminable part of an extended present.”5 That is why architects, whether they are Inigo Jones or Louis Kahn, make architectural pilgrimages to the Mediterranean roots of Western architecture. 
Consciousness of the past may also explain why architects tend to resist being categorized according to style; they instinctively understand that the history of architecture—including the present—is a continuity rather than a series of episodes. 
In 1419, Filippo Brunelleschi began the Foundling Hospital in Florence, whose delicate arcade of Corinthian columns surmounted by pedimented windows is generally considered the first building of the Renaissance. 
The German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel is best known for his severe Classical public buildings such as the superb Altes Museum in Berlin, but he also worked in other styles: Gothic in churches, and picturesque Italianate in villas. 
John Russell Pope, an eclectic master, designed beautiful picturesque Tudor, Georgian, and Colonial country estates. 
Domestic architects had to be adaptable, because house styles changed according to fashion. 
After the 1930s, influenced by the restoration of Williamsburg, American Colonial returned to favor. 
Since historic styles carry cultural overtones, using different styles was also a way for architects—and clients—to say different things. 
Architectural styles are mutable, unregulated, improvised. 
In part, this is simply the irrepressible urge of creative individuals. 
In addition to historical styles, there have also been styles associated with individual architects. 
It reappears in the work of contemporary Classicists such as Allan Greenberg. 
H. 
However, most personal styles are not easily adaptable. 
Some personal styles are simply too obsessive, which is probably why Frank Furness and the equally idiosyncratic Barcelona architect Antonio Gaudí never attracted a following. 
According to the architecture historian Peter Collins, the use of the word style to designate the architecture of a particular period or country is relatively late. 
“Style in the organization of façades and in the decoration of rooms is the poetry of architecture,” he taught his students, “which alone makes all the architect’s compositions truly interesting.”7 Literary style described the way that something was written, expressed, or performed. 
But exactly what do we see when we look at brickwork? 
What we see are details. 
Once the overall form of a building is determined—“the masterly, correct, and magnificent play of masses brought together in light”—there remains the question not only of what materials are to be used and how these will be assembled, but also of how the hundreds of parts of the building are to be designed: from the door frames and the window sills to the railings and the baseboards. 
There are dozens of ways that this can be done. 
Or nothing—many modern architects dispense with baseboards altogether. 
They are not wood but cast iron, since they are really disguised radiators. 
Railings can be replaced by parapets with pierced screens. 
The screens can be simple X-shapes, intertwining geometrical patterns, or complicated floral figures as in Art Nouveau staircases. 
Modern railings are usually metal. 
The railings in Mies van der Rohe’s buildings usually have only a single intermediate rail, located precisely halfway between the handrail and the floor; the vertical stanchions, the handrail, and the rail are made of identical square steel bars. 
When Brutalism was in fashion, railings were correspondingly heavy: concrete beams, wide enough to sit on but unpleasant to the touch, or massive wood balustrades, as solid as fenders on a truck dock. 
The screens of the railings of Peter Rose’s Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal are industrial-looking perforated sheets of anodized aluminum, prominently bolted to the stanchions. 
The transparent railings of I. 
Pei’s East Building are understated, elegant, and luxurious—like the building. 
That is why, just as an archaeologist can reconstruct a pot from a few shards, or a paleontologist can surmise the form of a prehistoric animal from bone fragments, it is possible to divine the architect’s idea of a building by examining its details. 
Although Venturi obviously was working in a Modernist idiom—there is a strip window and a steel-pipe railing—he also incorporated distinctly un-Modernist features such as trim, both inside and out. 
The International Style, in its effort to do away with ornament, outlawed trim. 
Windows had no frames. 
A broad stair rises beside the fireplace, then peters out to almost nothing. 
Ever since the Tugendhat House—for which Mies had designed the furniture—it was taken for granted that modern houses required modern furniture. 
1925, plus some antiques) would look good in it.”10 Instead of the iconic bent-tube Breuer chairs, there are homely ladderback chairs around the dining table; instead of an Eames lounge chair and ottoman, a comfortable stuffed sofa. 
Whether one is looking up at the tall dome of the Pantheon, descending the spiraling vortex of Wright’s Guggenheim Museum, or standing in the living room of Venturi’s small house, the experience of architecture is above all the experience of being in a separate, distinct world. 
The sense of being in a special place that is a three-dimensional expression of the architect’s imagination is one of the distinctive pleasures of architecture. 
That is why details are so important. 
This is not to say that architecture is stage décor. 
Architecture surrounds and shelters us. 
••• The Postmodern movement that followed the Vanna Venturi House was relatively short-lived but it had an important consequence: it broke the stranglehold of Modernism, leaving designers free to explore other forms of expression. 
“To be truly modern,” he writes, “means finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present. 
He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. 
Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. 
From this modest beginning, over the next two decades, came a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. 
Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. 
One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene. 
One of my favorite Greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard. 
Recent Shingle Style buildings are often broken down into many small parts, giving them a fussy and nervous appearance. 
Greenberg’s aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub. 
The two-story landward side is more informal, ringed by a sheltered porch. 
The sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy: the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves. 
The ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough, reused timbers. 
There is a nod here to the British Arts and Crafts architect C. 
But this is a modern house, although designed by an architect with a Classical sensibility. 
Hugh Newell Jacobsen studied at Yale under Louis Kahn, worked for Philip Johnson, and opened his own office in 1958. 
Starting in 1980, he evolved a hybrid style in which American regional forms and materials are combined with International Style precision, spareness, and simplicity. 
A post-and-beam Caribbean guest house with broad overhangs has the ingenuous simplicity of a beach shack. 
An Ohio country house recalls a board-and-batten Gothic Revival farmhouse. 
At first glance, the six pavilions resemble a little village, a little Amish village, judging from the austere white wood siding, the prim details, and the identical pitched roofs. 
This sounds precious, but Jacobsen is not a romantic. 
Although the multi-paned windows are present at an upper level of the wall, the corner of the room is glazed with large, mullionless sheets of plate glass, offering dramatic views of Long Island Sound. 
On the other hand, the fireplace, which in an orthodox International Style house would be painted brick or bush-hammered concrete, is decorously built into the wall, which gives the room a traditional, civilized air. 
Whereas Greenberg seamlessly resolves this tension, Jacobsen allows it to surface. 
Jacobsen artlessly combines new and old without the slightest hint of irony. 
Enrique Norten, the youngest of the three, takes a different course—he is trying to put Modernism back together again. 
In a relatively short time he produced an impressive body of work that includes institutional, commercial, and residential buildings. 
Both incorporate bulging, metal shell-roofs that recall the 1950s buildings of the French architect-engineer Jean Prouvé. 
Roofs hang by steel cables from steel masts. 
Railings, in a Norten design, are almost always opportunities for structural legerdemain: suspended sheets of glass, stretched steel cables, perforated metal screens. 
The three-story street façade is mostly a blank concrete wall; the wall facing the interior walled patio is entirely glass. 
A functionalist style pervades the house. 
A concrete wall in the dining room is bare save for the regular pattern of the formwork ties and the pour lines marks. 
Like Greenberg and Jacobsen, Norten reflects on the past. 
Decoration results not from trim, but from the surface quality of the different materials—concrete, red oak flooring, etched glass—and from the relentless articulation of structural connections. 
That is, while they carefully respond to the specifics of the program and the site, they do not explicitly acknowledge their immediate regional context. 
Whether one prefers the work of Greenberg, Jacobsen, or Norten is a matter of taste (I happen to like all three). 
They are serious about what they are doing, that is, their buildings exhibit a strong sense of conviction. 
They are disciplined, but they understand their self-imposed rules well enough to occasionally break them. 
The buildings of Greenberg, Jacobsen, and Norten, on the contrary, have a great deal to tell us about our past, our surroundings, and ourselves. 
So deep-rooted is this teaching that it remains a moral stricture on most architects, whether or not they are Modernists. 
Fear that being linked to a particular style is to be put in a box—like most creative people, architects dislike being categorized. 
Better to leave that to interior decorators and fashion designers, professions that architects regard with a mixture of disdain and envy. 
It would be part of the world—not architecture for architects, but architecture for the rest of us. 
Coda Richard Morris Hunt was the most celebrated American architect of the late nineteenth century. 
He was feted at home and abroad. 
A hundred years later, his counterpart is Frank O. 
Since being awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize in 1989, Gehry has gone on to win more honors than any other living architect, including such major arts awards as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize (a non-architectural award of which he is the first recipient) and the Japanese Praemium Imperiale, the Nobel of the art world. 
No pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple, the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica. 
They were both late bloomers. 
The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house: a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing. 
That was in 1978. 
Hunt was 43 when he came into his own. 
Of his Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Manhattan, the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler wrote: “The building is of Gothic design with very red brick, and very irregular stone dressings, which, it must be confessed regretfully, are not pleasing to the eye.”3 For his next project, the Lenox Library, Hunt tried something different. 
The result was a startling departure from convention, a monochrome limestone block of imposing dignity. 
The 1880s was a decade of great prosperity, and newly wealthy New Yorkers eagerly sought out Hunt’s architectural blend of good taste and ostentatious display. 
Hunt modeled the design of this 250-room residence on the Château de Blois, whose style is not the severe Classicism of the Italian Renaissance favored by architects such as Charles McKim, but the more ornate and picturesque French Renaissance. 
But the comparison does Hunt an injustice, for his design is neither prettified nor quaint. 
Vanderbilt, was a young bachelor (he married soon after the house was finished), and for him Hunt created an architecture that is robust, masculine, and immensely self-assured, not in the least like a fairytale. 
There are coats of arms bearing Vs all over the house. 
The interior is modern, bright, and open. 
The stonework of the house is impeccable, much crisper and more sharply defined than at Blois. 
The floors of fireproof hollow tile are supported by steel I-beams and the steep slate roofs by steel roof trusses. 
Equally novel are the elevators and telephones, electrical lighting, hot and cold running water, and forced air central heating. 
That is part of its style, too. 
The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, for example, is clad in titanium, previously used chiefly for building aircraft. 
One part of the building slides under an adjoining bridge; another emerges from a reflecting pool. 
The seeming disorder—a chaotic collision of forms—has no architectural precedent. 
The building as a composition comes first, the interior spaces follow. 
The Guggenheim has three distinct types of gallery spaces: traditional, skylit rooms for displaying its permanent collection of early Modernist art; a long boat-like space for temporary installations; and 11 smaller galleries, each with its own character, each dedicated to the works of a selected living artist. 
The building may appear offhanded, but there is nothing haphazard about the way it is organized. 
And, of course, to find ways to build those forms. 
The titanium sheets simply follow the churning surfaces like shingles on a Shingle Style roof; limestone is used in a similarly unaffected fashion, without articulated joints. 
By removing familiar elements such as coping strips, fascias, and trim, he accentuates the sculptural quality of his buildings. 
An architecture critic once described Gehry as “a smart man from Hollywood,” which nicely captures the architect’s blend of exuberant showmanship and canny behind-the-scenes savvy. 
In that regard, he repudiates the mannered industrial style that pervades the work of many contemporary architects. 
Gehry rejects both the moralistic functionalism of the International Style and the traditions of Classicism. 
Gehry, like Hunt, has changed the course of architecture. 
But his colliding forms and agitated architecture are curiously unthreatening.

I am desperately in need of assistance and I have summoned up courage to contact you. 
I am seeking your assistance to evacuate the sum of Nine Hundred Thousand US Dollars (Nine Hundred thousand USD) in cash to the States or any safe country; as far as I can be assured that it will be safe in your care until I complete my service here in Iraq. 
SOURCE OF MONEY: Some money in various currencies was discovered and concealed in barrels with piles of weapons and ammunition at a location near one of Saddam Hussein's old Presidential Palaces during a rescue operation and it was agreed by all party present that the money will be shared among us. 
The above figure was given to me as my share and to conceal this kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a British contact working with the UN here (his office enjoys some immunity)I was able to get the package out to a safe location entirely out of trouble spot. 
I have now found a secured way of getting the package out of Iraq for you to pick it up. 
Respectfully, Sgt. 
IRAQ. 
I am Fredrick Clifton, i work with a CHEMICAL CO. 
it is manufactured in North Korea but because of the Export duties in North Korea and some product cannot be exported directly to UK that is why we buy from Agents, i need a middle person who can transact the business with me, the person will buy from the agent in Malaysia, and resale to my company at the quoted price. 
my company will be sending our representative to Asia to purchase this chemical and i don't want them to go directly to the agent because of the price which i have quoted to them for this will cause a conflict of interest and i stand the risk of losing my job that is the more reason i need a middle person in this transaction(the person am supposed to use as middle man is not buoyant). 
I don't know if we can make this together as this is a long term and continuous business, if this is acceptable by you get back to me ASAP. 
At 100DayLoans we pride ourselves in putting our customer's security and personal information protection at the top of our priority list. 
We appreciate you trusting us with your valuable personal information and rest assure that we take an active and aggressive role in protecting all of your confidential information. 
The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally, a standard of deferred payment. 
Fiat money is without intrinsic use value as a physical commodity, and derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private". 
These demand deposits usually account for a much larger part of the money supply than currency. 
In the ancient world Hera was often associated with money. 
The name "Juno" may derive from the Etruscan goddess Uni (which means "the one", "unique", "unit", "union", "united") and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique). 
To: undisclosed recipients: ; Dear Beloved, My name is Jennifer Wilson I am a dying woman who have decided to donate what I have to you/ church/charity Organizations. 
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone. 
But now I regret all this, as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. 
Now that I know My time is near I have been touched by God to donate from what I have Inherited from my late husband for the good work of God, rather than Allow my relatives to use my husband hard earned funds ungodly. 
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. 
You need not pay any money upfront for this project. 
I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my time to come. 
I have asked God to Forgive me and I believe he has because He is a merciful God. 
I decided to WILL/donate the money to you for the good work of the lord, And also to help the motherless and less privilege and also for the Assistance of the widows according to (JAMES 1:27). 
NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the task is accomplished, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish.

It all depends on our trusting each other but I've chosen to contact you prayerfully and believing that you are the person to help me. 
The source of my parent's death was believed to be from our detractors who are never happy that my Father was making so much progress. 
So during the crisis in Liberia our home was among the first target by the Liberian rebels. 
My mother died immediately they storm our resident and my father sustained serious bruises that he could not survive while in the hospital. 
As i am talking to you now, i and my younger sister are staying in Ghana for some obvious reasons that i will like to relay to you on your response to this message. 
Because after my parents exit, the government of Liberia have taken over all of our belongings. 
No one knows of this deposit, it is only me as the next of kin and my father had earlier warned me not to disclose this issue to anyone before he died in the hospital after the incident that cause his death. 
And life has been very difficult since the government of Ghana started their deportation exercise which says that we refugees should evacuate their Bujumbura refugee camp to our various countries. 
Meanwhile, my father left an order with the depositary that without me, presenting a foreign partner that the company should not mind me. 
And any attempt for me to try and move this fund alone in my name will cause me more problems than I can imagine as an African young boy, as the government may bent on taking this money from me and my sister. 
As soon as we agree, we will come to your country where I and my sister will invest the money under your guide. 
I have all the documents of the deposit given to me by my late father and also the lawyer will help us get all necessary documents that will enable you receive this boxes on our behalf in your country for us to come over in your country for investment. 
Please NOTE that the earlier you help me the better as you will be doing God a great favor because our lives are no more safe with these people over here. 
I will give our lawyer your contact when I hear from you with your contact info, so we can discuss further arrangement on this transaction.I wait for your favorable reply.

I need you to make out time to read this mail attentively in order to understand the reason I am sending you this mail. 
We lived at No 215 West Wieuca Road Northeast Atlanta, Georgia USA and I attended the famous Frederick Douglass High School northwest Atlanta, Georgia USA, but when my mother fell sick and died June 2001, My father became weak every day and later he fall sick, I believe it was the shock of my mum's sudden death that deteriorated his health.. 
Then December 2005 my father called me and told that he doesn't want to die in a foreign land. 
On the 14 of December 2005 we returned back to COTE D'lVOIRE. 
But unfortunately on the 22nd of February 2006 my father collapsed and later died. 
The reason I am telling you and revealing to you my family's secret because my late dad's burial is over and my Uncle is searching every where looking for bank documents that my father used in depositing all his money in the bank when his sickness became serious.. 
This secret has been in my mind for close to a years now and I don't even know who to tell because I need someone to help me receive this money in a foreign account to enable me leave here peacefully. 
That mean you will provide an account where the money will be transfer into then I will take the next available flight to join you once you confirm to me that you have received the money in your account.. 
If you have the fear of God Almighty and believe that you can help me please respond to this mail include with your direct telephone number and also try to call me for more details. 
Please get back to me ASAP, Reply to this email God bless you as I look forward in meeting you soon!!!

Introduction Older adults are frequently counseled to lose weight, even though there is little evidence that overweight is associated with increased mortality in those over age 65. 
All studies found excess risk for persons with very low BMI, but that persons with moderately high BMI had little or no extra risk except in certain small subsets. 
Many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain throughout adult life. 
It has been suggested that weight standards be adjusted upwards for age [ 8 ] . 
In older adults, risk factors may have a greater effect on health than on mortality. 
Clinical trials powered to detect differences in YHL would often require fewer subjects than trials to detect survival differences or cardiovascular events [ 10 ] . 
Subjects were recruited from a random sample of the Medicare eligibility lists in four US counties. 
Additional information was collected in a brief telephone interview 6 months after each scheduled visit. 
Data collection began in 1989, and follow-up is virtually complete for all surviving subjects [ 12 ] . 
Years of life and years of healthy life YOL is the number of years that a person lived in the 7 years after baseline. 
We based YHL on self-rated health (is your health excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?) (EVGFP) which was collected every 6 months. 
Because we are examining health status over time, we added a sixth health state, dead. 
A drawback of this simple definition of 'healthy' is that it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and death, since all are considered 'not healthy'. 
Preliminary results were similar for the two approaches, however, and we report results using only the simpler definition. 
For those persons, and for 70 persons in the first cohort who did not have complete data, we estimated the last 4 years of YOL and YHL from their age, sex, and health at the end of 3 years, using validated methods presented elsewhere [ 20 ] . 
In the primary analysis we used observed 7-year YOL and YHL when they were available, and observed 3-year YOL and YHL plus 4-year estimated YOL and YHL when they were not (about 10% of the sample). 
Covariates The goal is to examine the association of YOL and YHL with BMI. 
Self-reported covariates include age, gender, smoking (never or former), history of arthritis, cancer, diabetes, fair or poor self-rated health status, limitations in activities of daily living or in instrumental activities of daily living, and 10 pounds or more unintended weight loss in the year before baseline. 
These measures are explained in more detail elsewhere [ 21 22 23 24 ] . 
Analysis All analyses were performed separately for men and women. 
We regressed YOL and YHL first on age, age squared, race, and smoking history (former or never), and second on all of the covariates listed above. 
The effect size is the difference in mean YOL (or YHL) in two groups divided by their common standard deviation. 
Results Table 1shows the distribution of key variables by sex and race. 
Black women had a higher mean BMI and higher percent obese (BMI ≥ 30) than the other three groups. 
About 78% of the subjects were healthy at baseline, declining to 57% at the end of 7 years; 20% had died (data not shown). 
There was thus substantial change in EVGFP over time, in both directions. 
For example, black women averaged 6.3 YOL, but only 4.2 YHL of a maximum possible 7. 
After adjusting for income and education, as well as age and former smoking, the difference in BMI was no longer statistically significant. 
After adjustment for income and education, the difference in weight loss since age 50 was no longer significant. 
We next examined the relationship of BMI to YOL and YHL. 
For example, YOL for women, adjusted for age, race, and smoking, averaged 6.0 years for women with a baseline BMI below 18.5, but averaged 6.6 years for women with a BMI from 25 to 29.9. 
Adjustment for extensive covariates also made little difference for YHL (columns 3 and 4). 
Categories whose confidence intervals do not overlap, or overlap only slightly, are significantly different. 
YOL for women (the uppermost curve on Figure 1) averaged about 6.5 out of 7 years, and showed no evident association between BMI and YOL for BMI above 20. 
Underweight men also had lower YOL, but this group was not significantly different from the normal group, in part because of low sample size. 
The lowermost two lines in Figure 1show mean YHL for women and men. 
YHL was significantly higher for women than for men in the normal and overweight groups, but the sexes had similar YHL in the underweight and obese groups. 
The effect sizes are shown in Table 3, with the significance results of the associated t-tests for the differences in means of the two groups being compared. 
The effect size is thus (4.92-4.50)/1.44 = .29. 
A clinical trial of a treatment to help underweight women achieve normal weight (presumably by addressing the underlying cause) could be expected to have 80% power with N = (1.96+.84) 2/.29 2= about 93 women per treatment arm, if 7-year YHL were the outcome measure. 
The effect size comparing overweight to normal yielded small, non-significant effect sizes, with inconsistent signs, suggesting extremely large sample sizes would be needed. 
Thus, an intervention to improve the health of underweight women to that of their normal weight peers could be performed using either YHL or YOL as the outcome variable. 
Trials to improve the health of the other groups to that of the normals would probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being overweight (for men or women) or obese (for men) affects YOL or YHL. 
The only substantive change was that some of the differences between blacks and whites shown in Table 1were no longer statistically significant, due to a smaller sample size. 
Andres et al proposed a desirable BMI of 24-30 for persons aged 60 to 69 [ 8 ] . 
In Figure 1, the overweight (as opposed to the obese) are no different from those of normal weight, suggesting that these two categories could be combined for older adults. 
This suggests that the development of future guidelines should take YHL or other measures of quality of life into account. 
That is, women who changed from being obese to being normal would likely show changes in YHL, but not YOL. 
Weight or weight change are sometimes used as the outcome in evaluations of interventions such as diet or exercise programs. 
Interestingly, the strongest health relationships were found for underweight older adults. 
Both YOL and YHL would be clinically significant in this patient group. 
We estimated the last four years of health data for about 10% of the sample, but results with and without this group were similar. 
Biases caused by over-adjustment are probably not large, since the findings were not sensitive to the number of variables adjusted for. 
The relative superiority of YHL to YOL would probably hold in trials with shorter follow-up. 
EVGFP, on which YHL was based, might have missed some effects of obesity on risk factors for future health. 
However, health measures designed specifically to measure those conditions might be more sensitive to change in weight than EVGFP. 
These more sensitive measures might also have detected differences between the overweight and normal weight persons, but we think this is unlikely given the absence of any differences in EVGFP. 
We found associations between YHL and obesity that were not present in the mortality analysis, suggesting that YHL may be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in older adults, especially for women. 
Using either YOL or YHL, however, we found no excess risk for older adults who would be classified as 'overweight' by the NHLBI guidelines.

These trials found that when compared with placebo, statins significantly reduced the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous and surgical coronary revascularization, and stroke in persons with stable coronary disease. 
Whether lipid-lowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if initiated immediately following an acute coronary syndrome is an important issue as the risk of a recurrent adverse cardiac events is much greater in patients with unstable coronary disease than in the stable setting. 
The answer? 
The major exclusion criteria were: total cholesterol level greater than 270 mg/dL; Q-wave myocardial infarction on admission or during the previous month; and, coronary revascularization in the months before admission, during the index hospitalization or anticipated following hospital discharge. 
Secondary endpoints included stroke, worsening heart failure, need for coronary revascularization and change in lipid levels throughout the study. 
The risk of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and resuscitated sudden cardiac death were each no different between the two groups. 
1.6%; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26-0.99, p = 0.045). 
By 16 weeks, the adjusted mean LDL cholesterol decreased to 72 mg/dL in atorvastatin-treated patients but increased to 135 mg/dL among placebo-treated patients. 
It was also the first trial to identify a short-term (ie, within 16 weeks) clinical benefit from statin therapy; in previous secondary prevention trials, the benefit of statin therapy was not evident for one to two years. 
Earlier secondary prevention statin trials had excluded patients with unstable coronary syndromes largely out of theoretical concern that statin-mediated reductions in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque. 
Furthermore, while the number of patients lost to follow up was small, if adverse events had occurred in those treated with atorvastatin (n = 3) but not placebo (n = 8), the overall trial results may have been neutral rather than positive. 
While rehospitalization for recurrent myocardial ischemia is an important determinant of quality of life and health care costs, other important endpoints were not significantly affected (eg, death, myocardial infarction, resuscitated sudden cardiac death, worsening heart failure, need for coronary revascularization, etc). 
The short duration of follow-up is also particularly troubling. 
Without longer clinical follow up, it is not possible to assess the intermediate-term effect (if any) of atorvastatin on hard endpoints such as death or myocardial infarction. 
First, patients who underwent recent revascularization or in whom it was planned were excluded. 
The investigators reasoned that recurrent ischemic events in this population were likely to result from restenosis or bypass graft closure and that statins would be less likely to affect these processes [ 8 ] . 
Furthermore, a number of recent trials have suggested that higher risk patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes fair better when an early invasive strategy is applied [ 12 13 14 ] and it is not uncommon for patients to be treated in this fashion. 
Nevertheless, patients who develop electrocardiographic Q-waves represent a substantial proportion of all patients with myocardial infarction. 
Third, despite the high risk nature of enrolled patients (ie, electrocardiogram [ECG] changes and/or other objective evidence of ischemia), the rate of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor utilization was quite low (1.1%). 
Fourth, it may not be possible to ascertain whether these findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels. 
Consequently, it remains uncertain whether one can extrapolate the MIRACL trial results to those who undergo coronary revascularization shortly before or after a coronary event, who present with a Q-wave myocardial infarction, who are treated with platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, or who have relatively low admission LDL cholesterol levels. 
Even if these findings are not confirmed after further study, one could still make a compelling argument that lipid-lowering therapy (barring contraindications) should be initiated early and universally in patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome: First, the long-term safety and effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of stable coronary disease is well-established [ 1 2 3 ] ; Second, as evidenced by MIRACL, these agents are safe when initiated at the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome; Third, the in-hospital initiation of lipid-lowering therapy appears to promote greater long-term utilization of these agents [ 18 19 20 21 ] . 
Furthermore, data from the recently presented Heart Protection Study suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of baseline cholesterol level [ 4 ] . 
More MIRACLes ahead? 
There is currently only one ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trial of early versus delayed statin therapy in this setting, A-2-Z (Aggrastat to Zocor, Merck) [ 29 ] . 
In the first four months, patients will be randomized to simvastatin 40 mg daily or placebo. 
The primary composite endpoint is the occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at one year. 
If benefits accrue, but do so later during follow up, it would be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more aggressive vs. 
The Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE IT) trial is looking at 4,000 patients within 10 days of an acute coronary syndrome and randomizing them to either pravastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg daily [ 29 ] . 
In 2002, many would consider it unethical to withhold statins from patients with established coronary disease. 
Future secondary prevention studies should look at patients with stable or unstable disease and will need to address the comparative efficacy of different statins (or newer agents), assess the incremental benefit of combination therapy [ 30 ] and determine whether there is a serum cholesterol 'floor' below which reductions are unlikely to provide further clinical benefit.

Three isoforms that differ in the ratio of ATPase/ADPase activity are present on the cell surface [ 2 ] : E-NTPDase1 with a ratio of 1, E-NTPDase2 with a ratio of 10 and E-NTPDase3 with a ratio of 3-5. 
Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the NTPDases will help description of their physiological functions, and development of strategies to regulate the functions of the enzymes. 
Divalent cations like Ca 2+or Mg 2+are required for activity, and maximal activity is reached when the concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal [ 1 ] . 
Sequence comparisons indicate that most of NTPDases contain five highly conserved regions, apyrase conserved region, ACR1 - ACR5 [ 9 11 ] . 
E-NTPDase1 is also called CD39, as it was first described as an antigen present on activated B and T lymphocytes. 
E174 in ACR3 and S218 in ACR4 are required for catalytic function [ 12 ] . 
Mutation of W187A in ACR3 affected CD39 folding and translocation, while mutation of W459A in ACR5 increased ATPase activity but diminished ADPase activity [ 14 ] . 
These results suggest that the conserved residues of the ACR1 to 5 regions are involved in the catalytic mechanism of CD39. 
Since the interactions of Ca +2and Mg +2with proteins are difficult to study due to the lack of spectroscopic properties, vanadyl (V IV=O) 2+has been used as a probe of the ligands that compose Mg 2+, Ca 2+, and Mn 2+binding sites of several proteins, including carboxypeptidase [ 16 ] , S-adenosylmethionine synthetase [ 17 18 ] , pyruvate kinase [ 19 20 ] , and F 1 -ATPase [ 21 22 ] . 
Vanadyl has one axial and four equatorial coordination sites relative to the axis of the double-bounded oxygen, an arrangement that is similar to that for Ca 2+and Mg 2+. 
In this report, we characterized the signals that were obtained from bound VO 2+when ATP or ADP was present at the catalytic site of the purified soluble CD39. 
Results Nucleotidase activity of purified soluble CD39 with VO 2+as cofactor The ability of purified soluble CD39 to hydrolyze VO 2+ATP is shown in Figure 1. 
1A). 
1B). 
Vanadyl is unstable in aqueous solution at pH7.0 in the absence of chelator and will precipitate out of solution as [VO(OH) 2 ] n . 
This means that the actual VO 2+concentration was lower than 0.5 mM. 
Characterization of bound VO 2+ADPNP by CW-EPR The parallel features of CW-EPR spectrum of bound VO 2+in the presence of ADPNP, an ATP analog, are shown in Figure 2a. 
Of the eight transitions that result from the parallel oriented molecules, the -7/2 || , -5/2 || , +3/2 || , +5/2 || , and +7/2 || transitions (shown in the figures from left to right, respectively) do not overlap with perpendicular transitions. 
The intensity of -5/2 || peak is used as direct measurement of the amount of bound VO 2+, since this peak is the most intense peak in the EPR spectrum that contains contribution only from A || but not A⊥ [ 21 26 ] . 
VO 2+bound as the VO 2+-AMPPNP complex to sCD39 produced a strong spectrum characterized by A || of 504.25 MHz and g || of 1.9410 (Fig. 
The best fit of EPR species T to eq 1 is one equatorial nitrogen from an amino group and three equatorial oxygen ligands from carboxyl or phosphate groups (Table 2). 
One set had A || of 521.78 MHz and g || of 1.937, which is defined as species D1 (Fig. 
The other set displayed A || of 490.01 MHz and g || of 1.9435, which is called species D2 (Fig. 
In order to distinguish species D1 from D2, the sample with VO 2+-AMPCP bound to sCD39 was thawed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, and the VO 2+EPR spectrum was collected again. 
The intensity of species D1 was not changed as it accounted for 12.1% of the intensity of species T of the bound VO 2+-AMPPNP. 
One set includes two equatorial oxygen from two water molecules, one equatorial oxygen from a carboxyl group or phosphate, and one equatorial nitrogen from an amino group. 
The best fit for the EPR species D2 to eq 1 is one equatorial oxygen from a hydroxyl group and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate. 
The entire process took about 15 seconds. 
VO 2+-ATP complex bound to sCD39 produced an EPR spectrum with A || of 489.5 MHz and g || of 1.9455, which corresponded to species D2 (Fig. 
The signal intensity from the bound VO 2+-nucleotide complex accounted only for 7.5% of that of species T from bound non-hydrolysable VO 2+-ADPNP complex. 
The EPR parameters derived from this VO 2+-EPR spectrum were 489.5 MHz for A || and 1.9455 for g || respectively, which is consistent with species D2. 
Free VO 2+binding to sCD39 characterized by CD-EPR Like other metals (Ca 2+and Mg 2+), free VO 2+inhibited the nucleotidase activities of sCD39 at high concentration (data not shown). 
The parallel transitions of bound VO 2+-EPR spectrum are shown in Figure 6. 
6b). 
The best fit of equatorial ligands for species V according to eq 1 is two equatorial oxygen from hydroxyl groups and another two equatorial oxygen from two water molecules. 
By studying the EPR spectra of bound VO 2+in the presence of different nucleotides, we show that the interaction of soluble CD39 with ATP is different from that with ADP. 
The EPR features of VO 2+are able to reveal some details about how CD39 hydrolyzes ATP and ADP. 
The g and A tensors derived from species T are 1.9410 and 504.25 MHz respectively, which can be fitted best with one amino group and three groups combined from carboxyl and phosphate groups as the equatorial ligands of the bound VO 2+on sCD39. 
It is not unusual for the ε-amino group of lysine to coordinate with metals in enzymes. 
Thus one amino group from lysine, one carboxyl group from aspartate or glutamate, and two oxygens from the phosphates of ADPNP serve as the equatorial ligands of sCD39 bound VO 2+in the presence of ADPNP. 
As we have reported that sCD39 releases intermediate ADP before ADP is further cleaved during ATP hydrolysis [ 25 ] , sCD39 probably has two conformations that bind metal-ADP complexes, one is the conformation that releases the ADP intermediate, and another that recruits intermediate ADP back to the enzyme for further hydrolysis to AMP. 
The two EPR species observed with VO 2+-AMPCP probably correspond to the two different conformations of bound ADP at the same catalytic site on sCD39. 
Incubation of sCD39 with VO 2+-AMPCP at room temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the intensity of species D2, while the signal intensity of species D1 remained unchanged. 
More evidence for two conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the EPR spectra of bound VO 2+-ATP. 
The lower signal intensities of species D1 and D2 compared to that of species T suggest that the affinity of sCD39 for ADP or its analog AMPCP is lower than that for the ATP analog ADPNP, which is consistent with the result that only ATP analogs were detected on sCD39 [ 25 ] . 
Since the conformation corresponding to species D2 is found in the presence of ATP and is likely to be the conformation that releases bound VO +2-ADP, it is likely that the VO +2ligands are one phosphate and two carboxyl groups [ 25 ] . 
The changes of D62 on ACR1, E174 on ACR3, D213 (D219 in HB6) and S218 on ACR4 dramatically decrease both ATPase and ADPase activities of CD39 [ 12 15 ] . 
The catalytic base attack results in cleavage of the γ-phosphate of ATP, and one carboxyl group replaces the γ-phosphate as a metal ligand (from species T to species D2), which is accompanied by a swap of an amino group with a hydroxyl group (S218?). 
The constant carboxyl group that appears in all conformations of sCD39 hydrolysis is likely contributed by D213 since it is close to S218. 
Conclusions VO 2+can functionally substitute for Ca 2+as a cofactor for sCD39. 
The protein ligands for VO +2in the presence of ATP are suggested to be carboxyl and amino groups, while those in the presence of ADP are probably carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. 
These results will provide guides for further studies of the catalytic mechanism of NTPDases. 
Louis, MO). 
Cell culture and preparation of soluble CD39 sCD39 transfected stable HighFive™ insect cells were cultured as described by Chen and Guidotti [ 25 ] . 
After concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B and nickel affinity column chromatography, the ammonium sulfate precipitated sCD39 was collected and resuspended in about 50 μl of 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5). 
The fractions containing the major peak were collected, and the solvent was changed to 20 mM Hepes (pH8.0), 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl with an YM30 centricon from Millipore. 
Concentrations of proteins were determined using D C Protein Assay from BIO-RAD using the provided protocol. 
After incubation for 15 minutes, the reactions were stopped with 2% perchloroacetic acid Nucleotides were separated by HPLC on an anion exchange column (a 10 × 0.46 mm SAX column from Rainin Instruments) based on the method of Hartwick and Brown [ 29 ] . 
The gradient used was 4 min, 0-2.5% (B); 26 min, 2.5-25% (B). 
Then VO 2+-nucleotide complexes were added to purified sCD39 at 1:1 molar ratio, mixed, and incubated for 5 minutes on ice before they were transferred into EPR tubes. 
EPR Measurement CW-EPR experiments were carried out at X-band (9 GHz) using a Bruker 300E spectrometer with a TE102 rectangular standard cavity and a liquid nitrogen flow cryostat operating at 150 K. 
To estimate the types of groups that serve as equatorial ligands to VO 2+in each condition, the observed values of A || derived from simulation of the EPR spectrum by QPOWA were compared with the coupling constants obtained from model studies [ 24 32 ] using: A ||calc = Σ n i A ||i /4 where i represents the different types of equatorial ligand donor groups, n i (=1-4) is the number of ligands of type i, and A ||i is the measured coupling constant for equatorial donor group i [ 24 ] . 
Background Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the formation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) from glutamate. 
GABA signaling plays several roles in neuronal development. 
In some classes of neural progenitors GABA stimulates these processes while in others it has an antagonistic activity. 
Later, during postnatal development, normal GABAergic input is required for activity-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex as shown in the Gad2 knockout mouse [ 15, 16]. 
Targeted mutations of the Gad1 gene lead to defective development of the secondary palate [ 17, 18]. 
This conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft palate defect seen in mice with a deletion or targeted mutation in the β3 subunit of the GABA A receptor [ 19, 20, 21, 22]. 
The potential for this pathway to be involved in the early development of additional non-neural tissues has not yet been thoroughly explored [ 23]. 
Using a whole mount in situ hybridization approach, we found that Gad1 is indeed expressed in a number of different regions and tissues. 
These specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be sources of developmental signals [ 24, 25, 26]. 
The expression patterns show that Gad1 is expressed in several non-CNS structures that are derived from each of the three germ layers of the embryo. 
At E9.0 Gad1 was readily detected in the tailbud (figure 1A). 
At more cranial levels within the tail, expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm, ventral neural tube, notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut (figure 1E). 
In the pharyngeal region of E9.5 embryos, Gad1 RNA was detected in and around the second, third and fourth pharyngeal pouches (figure 2A). 
Transcripts were initially expressed in the pre-apical ectodermal ridge (pre-AER) at E9.5 (figure 3A,B) and by E10.5 were seen in the definitive AER of the forelimb (figure 3D). 
By E11.5 forelimb AER expression was fading and expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal forelimb and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb (figure 3G,H). 
Sections indicate that the expression within the limb buds was in surface ectoderm and adjacent mesenchyme (data not shown). 
Gad1 RNA was also detected in some of the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage. 
By E13.5, Gad1 expression was detected in the anterior lateral nasal and maxillary rows and was activated in the rhinal, labial and submental vibrissae (figure 4C,D). 
Sections of E12.5 whole mounts show that Gad1 expression was localized to the epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae (figure 4G,H) and was maintained as the placodes begin to invaginate (figure 4G). 
Embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any staining pattern at any of the stages tested (E8.5- E14.5). 
Discussion The expression results reported here show that Gad1 was activated in several tissues outside of the central nervous system during mouse development. 
It was surprising that this very early phase of Gad1 expression was largely outside of the developing CNS and was localized in the tail bud mesenchyme and in the pre-apical ectodermal ridge (pre-AER) of the forelimb bud. 
Westmoreland and B.G.C., unpublished results). 
Gad1 mRNA translation or protein stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level of GABA [ 30, 31]. 
This alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop codon into the Gad1 mRNA and can produce the truncated proteins, GAD25 and GAD44, from its 5'; and 3' ends respectively. 
These additional mechanisms of Gad1 regulation may control the production of GAD proteins and the synthesis of GABA in the non-neural cell types detected in our study. 
Our analysis showed that Gad1 expression is first detectable earlier at E9.0 and revealed novel non-CNS sites of expression in the pharyngeal region, vibrissae, tail bud and limb bud. 
Previously reported sites of embryonic Gad1 expression outside of the brain and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens fibers and the olfactory pit [ 38, 39]. 
We also detected Gad1 expression in these tissues (please see figure 3Aand data not shown). 
Our interest in the role of GABA signaling in developing tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from the cleft palate phenotype of the Gad1 and the β3 GABA A receptor subunit mutants [ 17, 18, 19, 21, 22]. 
Both are ectodermal structures known to be sources of developmental signals required for morphogenesis and patterning [ 24, 25, 26, 40]. 
Expression of GABA receptor subunits in adjacent tissues would indicate that these receptors read the developmental signals mediated by GABA in these structures and tissues. 
Some of the Gad1 expressing tissues (vibrissal placodes, AER) are known sources of developmental signals. 
The morning that the vaginal plug was found was considered 0.5 days of gestation. 
Its 5' end corresponds to nucleotide 142 in exon 1 [ 43] and the 3' end is at nucleotide 2041 in the cDNA sequence [ 44]. 
Embryos were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight and used immediately for the in situ hybridization. 
The embryos were then washed in a 1:1 mix of wash I and wash II (0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) for 10 minutes at 70°C. 
Following the RNase treatment the embryos were washed in three changes of 50% formamide, 2X SSC pH5.0 at 70°C for a total of 90 minutes. 
The embryos were photographed without clearing using a Leica model MZFL III dissecting scope, a Hamamatsu model C4742-95 digital camera and Openlab 2.0.7 software. 
Sections were phtotographed using an Olympus BX60 microscope fitted with a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). 
While 1°SS is typically considered an autoimmune exocrinopathy, the immune destruction can often extend to affect non-exocrine organs. 
The association of liver disease and 1°SS was suggested more than 40 years ago [ 1 ] . 
Liver diseases associated with 1°SS include primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)-autoimmune cholangitis [ 8 9 10 ] , autoimmune hepatitis [ 5 6 ] , viral hepatitis (B and C) [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ] , sclerosing cholangitis [ 22 ] , and nodular regenerative hyperplasia [ 23 ] . 
We report the results of a review of cases undertaken to determine the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and liver disease in patients with 1°SS referred to a tertiary care center and the association of abnormal LFTs with other systemic features and autoimmunity markers of 1°SS. 
Comparison of results of patients with and without liver disease was done using t-tests of continuous variables and Fisher's exact test or x2 for categoric measures. 
Of the 73 patients, a 54% of them (40 patients) have had a salivary gland biopsy performed. 
All patients studied had objective evidence of 1°SS, including keratoconjunctivitis sicca, positive labial salivary gland biopsy, autoantibodies and/or salivary gland hypofunction. 
The mean age at time of onset of disease was 45 ± 20.5 years old and disease duration was 4.9 years ± 4.5 years (mean ± range). 
For these SS patients studied, abnormal LFTs were more common than any other potential non-exocrine features of SS. 
Two deaths occurred in the population studied, both attributed to liver failure. 
In all cases, the diagnosis of 1°SS antedated the onset of liver disease or its diagnosis. 
Two patients carried the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus and one had antibodies to hepatitis C virus. 
Risk factors for liver disease were identified in 40% of the patients with abnormal liver function tests and are described in Table 4. 
Only 5 patients had documented evidence of tobacco consumption. 
Abnormalities were persistent (present on every occasion when measured more than once) in 19 patients (65.5% of those with abnormal LFTs), intermittent (presence of LFT abnormalities was not found in all determinations) in 9 (31%) and in one case (3.5%) there was only one determination of liver function tests. 
Patients with abnormal liver function tests were more likely to have lung, kidney or hematological manifestations, when compared to Sjögren's patients without liver disease. 
Regarding laboratory test results, patients with liver disease were more likely to have an elevated sedimentation rate at some point during the course of their disease. 
The sample was too small to determine whether a specific ENA was associated with liver disease. 
The prevalence of this association was found to be higher in our study than in other previous series [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 ] . 
Denko in 1960 reported that 12% of patients with SS had hepatosplenomegaly [ 29 ] . 
In 1970, Whaley reported liver disease in 6% of patients with SS and mentioned an association with anti-mitochondrial antibodies [ 2 ] . 
Other studies have reported variable prevalence [ 3 28 ] and different histopathological findings in liver biopsies ranging from cholestatic liver damage (stage I primary biliary cirrhosis) to chronic active hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus. 
An association of ENA response with liver disease has been described in children with autoimmune hepatitis, where anti-ENA-positive patients demonstrated more severe liver test abnormalities than those who were anti-ENA-negative [ 32 ] . 
Phenotypic characterization of the minor salivary glands with immunohistochemistry in patients with hepatitis C virus infection and/or 1°SS has given conflicting results [ 14 15 ] Some reports mention that the salivary gland findings are strikingly similar in patients with liver disease associated with HCV infection than in those with 1°SS [ 12 ] , while others mention distinctive differences between both groups regarding focus score, expression of surface markers in lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary glands and in epithelial cells, as well as differences in the degree of inflammation [ 14 15 ] . 
Expression of autoimmunity markers also tends to differ between HCV-infection and 1°SS. 
Also, in most cases sicca symptoms are not present in individuals with HCV as compared with the 1°SS population. 
It is important to note that HCV appears to account for a subgroup of patients with exocrine complaints in which half the cases might meet the definition for SS according to European and Manthorpe criteria. 
An aberrant interaction between lymphocytes and different epithelial tissues has been proposed as a mechanism for the damage seen in different organs in 1° SS [ 36 ] . 
Epithelial cells have been proposed to be active participants rather than passive targets in the chronic immune response in 1°SS but further studies are needed to establish the role of liver epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease, including the analysis of HLA expression and cytokine secretion pattern in these cells. 
In previous studies, a pericholangial lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage I of primary biliary cirrhosis, has been reported in 1°SS with abnormal liver function tests or positivity for AMA [ 4 7 ] . 
Other authors had proposed that SS associated with PBC should be considered a form of secondary SS that resembles more the "sicca complex" with exocrine features seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [ 40 41 ] . 
Since the patients were studied in a tertiary care referral center, the severity of the disease and the prevalence of the manifestations might be different from the general 1°SS population. 
However, given that most patients had persistent rather than intermittent abnormalities of LFTs and that the use of hepatotoxic drugs was not elicited in the majority of patients with liver abnormalities, a toxic effect of medications could not be established. 
Competing interests None. 
Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, recently called attention to the clear inequalities in science between developing and developed countries and to the challenges of building bridges across these gaps that should bring the United Nations and the world scientific community closer to each other (Annan 2003). 
Annan stressed the importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing countries, asserting that “This unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries, but for development itself.” Indeed, Mr. 
For example, recent United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimates (UNESCO 2001) indicate that, in 1997, the developed countries accounted for some 84% of the global investment in scientific research and development, had approximately 72% of the world researchers, and produced approximately 88% of all scientific and technical publications registered by the Science Citation Index (SCI). 
It is also likely that there is a statistical bias on the part of the SCI as a bibliometric database, since it represents North American and European publications far better than those of the rest of the world (Gibbs 1995; May 1997; Alonso and Fernández-Juricic 2001; Vohora and Vohora 2001). 
Annan has implied? 
For example, Latin America and China, although representing, respectively, only 1.8% and 2% of scientific publications worldwide, have increased the number of their publications between 1990 and 1997 by 36% and 70%, respectively, which is a much higher percentage than the increments reached by Europe (10%) and industrial Asia (26%). 
Publishing Trends in the Americas Using the SCI databases produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), as well as data compiled by the Red Iberoamericana de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnología (RICYT), we examined the differences in the number and proportion of scientific publications between the developed world and the developing world from 1990 until 2000, focusing on the Americas as a case study. 
Latin America as a whole contributed only 5.45% to the total number of scientific publications in these ten years (RICYT 2002). 
Further analyses, correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money invested in research and development for each region, also show that, in contrast to both Canada and United States, the trend in Latin America has been an increase in relative output throughout the 1990s (Figure 2). 
Although the cost of research is undoubtedly cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries, overhead and other work standards, these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in Latin America, particularly from 1995 until 2000 (Figure 2). 
Indeed, this scientific productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science itself as compared with the GDP of Latin America as a whole. 
Latin American investment in research and development represented only 0.59% of the regional GDP in 1998, a very weak effort compared with that of the United States (2.84%) and Canada (1.5%). 
Other countries, such as Costa Rica, Cuba, Brazil, and Chile, have invested a much greater proportion of their GDP in research and development than the other countries of this region (Albornoz 2001). 
Explaining the Increase in Publishing Productivity in Latin America One potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in Latin America is that scientific development during the 1990s was particularly strong for many countries of this region. 
A potentially more important question, however, is why the number of publications per dollar invested in research and development has been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in the United States and Canada. 
It is possible that publishing in international journals as a measure of scientific productivity is becoming more important in Latin America. 
International cooperation resulting in more scientific collaborations among scientists in Latin America, Europe, and the United States may also have increased the relative number of publications in Latin America. 
Scientific Impact from Latin America What, exactly, is the relative impact of such developing regions as Latin America on the scientific community? 
We credited a region with a publication if any of the authors were affiliated with institutions from that region. 
For the top 20 ecological journals, the American subcontinents of South, Central, and North America accounted for 62% of the publications worldwide. 
When we examined the data as contributions to the top 10 ecological journals (impact factors 10.51–3.31) versus the top 11–20 (impact factors 3.28–2.47), the Latin American countries contributed nearly twice as many publications to journals in the second category (8% in the top 11–20 compared with 4% in the top 10). 
In contrast, the United States contributed somewhat more publications to the top 10 journals (84%) than the top 11–20 journals (79%). 
In this case, the United States contributed 60% of the publications to the top 10 journals and only 40% of the publications to the top 11–20 journals. 
However, publishing in Science and Nature was not enough to gain prominence, as evidenced by the number of citations of these researchers. 
Similar findings were also reported for Asia (Swinbanks et al. 
One possibility is that the main research agendas between both regions are somewhat different and that the top journals, which are published in the developed world, respond more to the scientific mainstream of the developed regions. 
Another consideration is that more local journals from developed regions are listed by the SCI than similar journals from developing regions (Gibbs 1995). 
But it takes more than publishing good papers to become a highly cited scientist. 
Funding these activities, however, requires a greater proportion of research money being spent on meetings for researchers in the developing compared with the developed world. 
Annan. 
One is that science, as a discipline, would benefit from the contributions of many disparate groups around the world, rather than being dominated by two geographic regions. 
These examples are important not only for those regions of the developing world, but are also in themselves scientific innovations that can greatly advance the knowledge of the rest of the world. 
Although the evidence presented here demonstrates that there is a long way to go before developing countries contribute a more equitable share to the international scientific community, there are also reasons to be optimistic. 
The extremely high scientific productivity of many developing nations, corrected for and despite the rather limited availability of funds, suggests that increased funding to the sciences will be an excellent investment by developing nations in terms of publications as a measure of scientific output, particularly if these publications can target the journals that have the greatest impact. 
Annan are slowly being built. 
Does it apply to many other global health risks? 
The Global Burden of Disease Database, maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), collects data from countries around the world on risk factors such as tobacco, malnutrition, childhood abuse, unsafe sex, childbirth, and cholesterol levels, as well as on disease burdens, for example depression, blindness, and diarrhea. 
For being underweight in childhood, for example—the leading risk factor for global loss of healthy life—they found that only 35% of the disease burden occurred in severely underweight children, the rest occurred in those only moderately underweight. 
The analysis confirms—and extends to a global level—previous research showing that many major health risks are important across the range of exposure levels, not just among individuals exposed to high levels of risk. 
Lung fibroblasts respond, in vitro , to inflammatory cytokines by producing growth factors and collagen, resulting in fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition [ 2 3 4 ] . 
This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target cells, via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, perpetuating the fibrotic process [ 2 ] . 
Prostaglandin (PG)E 2 is thought to have antifibrotic properties in vitro , but also can have proinflammatory effects both in vivo and in vitro [ 10 11 12 ] . 
It has been previously reported that IPF lung fibroblasts have decreased COX-2 expression compared to normal lung fibroblasts and, hence, have decreased PGE 2 production [ 12 20 21 ] . 
Materials and methods Primary lung fibroblasts Fibroblasts from the lungs of seven patients (6 males) with IPF (HF-IPF) were harvested: a) from excised lung at the time of lung transplantation; b) during an autopsy performed within 4 hours from death; or c) during open or transbronchial lung biopsies at the time of diagnosis. 
The mean age of the patients was 59 (range 43-71)]. 
The cells were harvested and cultured as per the protocol described by Kumar et al. 
Briefly, lung tissue sections were finely cut with sterile scissors and incubated with serum free DMEM containing trypsin, DNAse and collagenase for 30 min. 
Culture medium (DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum [FBS] and penicillin/streptomycin) was replaced three times per week and fibroblasts were passed (1:2 split) at the time they became confluent. 
Inducible cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and eicosanoid production COX-2 activity was determined by measuring PGE 2 , 6-keto-PGF 1α (stable PGI 2 metabolite), TXB 2 (stable TXA 2 metabolite), and PGF 2α production in stimulated fibroblasts. 
Fibroblasts were then incubated in DMEM with 5% FBS alone or in the same medium with IL-1β (2.5 ng/ml) for 24 hours. 
After 30 min of incubation the supernatant was collected and saved at -70°C for later eicosanoid analysis. 
The above experiments were repeated in HF-IPF (n = 2) and HF-NL (n = 2) using serum free media conditions. 
Briefly, deuterium-labeled internal standards of PGE 2 , PGF 2α , TXB 2 , and 6-keto-PGF 1α were added to the supernatants with isopropyl alcohol. 
After acidification to pH 3.5, the samples were extracted on preconditioned C-18 PrepSep columns (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), and eluted with ethyl acetate. 
After evaporation of reagents, the residue was subjected to TLC plates, using the solvent system chloroform/ethanol (93:7, vol/vol) for PGF 2α and TXB 2 , and ethyl acetate/methanol (93:2, vol/vol) for 6-keto-PGF 1α and PGE 2 . 
The methoxime derivative of TXB 2 , PGE 2 and 6-keto-PGF 1α was made by treatment with 2% methoxamine hydrochloride in pyridine at 70°C for 60 min, followed by evaporation of the pyridine, addition of water, and extraction with ethyl acetate. 
Eicosanoids were quantified by measuring the ratio of the intensity of ions m/z 569/573 for PGF 2α , m/z 614/618 for TXB 2 and 6-keto-PGF 1α , and m/z 524/528 for PGE 2 . 
Western analysis After washing with PBS at pH 7.4, pellets were lyzed in solubilization buffer containing 50 mM TRIS at pH 8, 1% Tween 20, 10 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, diethyldithiocarbamic acid, leupeptin and pepstatin A (all from Sigma Chemical), sonicated, boiled with gel loading buffer (62.5 mM TRIS-HCl, at pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromophenol blue), and centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 10 min. 
After washing, the membranes were incubated with luminol based chemiluminescence reagent (DuPont NEN Research Products, Boston, MA). 
RNA was quantified by determining light absorbance at 260 nm and then fractioned by electrophoresis (10 μg per lane) on a 1% agarose MOPS/formaldehyde gel. 
The RNA was transferred by gravity-assisted capillary method with 6X SSC to nylon hybridization membrane, and then fixed to the membrane by UV crosslinking (Stratalinker 1200 μj/cm 2). 
The COX-2 probe was random primed following the directions of the manufacturer (Megaprime ®, Amersham/Pharmacia). 
The membrane was wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed to Kodak XR film at -70°C with intensifier screen overnight. 
Results Baseline and stimulated COX-2 activity in HF-IPF and HF-NL Unstimulated eicosanoid production was similar in both HF-IPF and HF-NL (Fig. 
When fibroblasts were stimulated with IL-1β there was a significant and similar upregulation of PGE 2 production in both HF-IPF and HF-NL (28.35 [range: 9.09-89.09] versus 17.12 [8.58-29.33] ng/10 6cells/30 min, respectively; P = 0.25; [Fig. 
IL-1β-stimulated production of TXB 2 (stable metabolite of the active TXA 2 ), PGF 2α , and 6-keto-PGF 1α (stable metabolite of PGI 2 ) increased modestly in every case, except TXB 2 production by HF-NL, which decreased (0.75 [0.15-2.58] ng/10 6cells/30 min at baseline versus 0.61 [0.21-1.64] ng/10 6cells/30 min with IL-1β stimulation) (Fig. 
Because PGI 2 and TXA 2 have opposing effects in vivo , we calculated the ratio of their metabolites (6-keto-PGF 1α :TXB 2 ) and found a significantly lower ratio in HF-IPF at baseline (0.08 [0.04-0.52] versus 0.12 [0.11-0.89] in HF-IPF and HF-NL, respectively; P = 0.028) and a similar trend under stimulated conditions (0.24 [0.05-1.53] versus 1.08 [0.51-3.79] in HF-IPF and HF-NL, respectively; P = 0.09 [Fig. 
Baseline and stimulated COX-2 expression Western blot in unstimulated fibroblasts showed no detectable COX-2 protein in either group of cells, while IL-1β significantly induced COX-2 to a similar degree in IPF and normal lung fibroblasts (Fig. 
Northern blot showed minimal COX-2 mRNA in unstimulated cells and significant upregulation of COX-2 mRNA expression when stimulated with IL-1β in both HF-IPF and HF-NL (Fig. 
Discussion Several factors modulate fibroblast proliferation and collagen production, including mitogenic cytokines (e.g., transforming growth factor β [TGFβ], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]), eicosanoids (i.e., PGE 2 , TXB 2 , and PGI 2 ), and antifibrogenic cytokines (e.g. 
The above results suggest that a decreased PGI 2 :TXA 2 ratio could be a phenotypic alteration present in IPF fibroblasts, resulting in a loss of their capacity to autoregulate proliferation and extracellular matrix production. 
TXA 2 has been studied extensively because of its apparent role in atherosclerosis, due to its prothrombotic and mitogenic activities on vascular smooth muscle cells [ 15 16 ] . 
In vascular smooth muscle cells TXA 2 stimulates synthesis of bFGF and increases the expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos , c-myc , and egr-1 , which are associated with entry into the cell growth cycle [ 15 ] . 
On the other hand, PGI 2 decreases vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycane synthesis, via activation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent production of cAMP [ 17 ] . 
These effects may counteract the profibrotic effects seen with TXA 2 and it is possible that an alteration of a "normal" physiologic balance between PGI 2 and TXA 2 could increase tendency towards fibrogenesis. 
Although this is a possibility, the age-related shift in PG production has only been shown at very high cell passages and has not been documented in vivo . 
PGE 2 can decrease fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, and increase collagen degradation [ 5 6 7 8 ] . 
Vancheri and collaborators [ 20 ] found that TNF-α-stimulated fibrotic lung fibroblasts had decreased COX-2 expression and PGE 2 production, but they further showed that these findings were a result of decreased expression of TNF-α receptors. 
In another study, Keerthisingam et al. 
This study differed from ours in that a different stimulus was used. 
[ 21 ] were obtained from patients with systemic sclerosis, which makes their fibroblast population more heterogeneous. 
[ 12 ] also reported a decreased production of PGE 2 by IL-1β-stimulated IPF fibroblasts, due to decreased COX-2 expression [ 12 ] . 
However, we feel certain that the diagnostic accuracy of our patient population was high, due to the fact that 5 out of a total of 7 IPF subjects included in our study underwent lung transplantation with confirmatory pathology results consistent with IPF. 
In addition, our results were similar when comparing lung fibroblasts obtained from 5 subjects with advanced stage IPF with those of 2 subjects at an earlier stage of their disease, who had received no therapy. 
Conclusion We have found that fibroblasts cultured from normal and IPF human lungs have a significant and similar induction of the COX-2 enzyme when stimulated with IL-1β, but that IPF fibroblasts produced more thromboxane and had a significantly lower prostacyclin:thromboxane ratio. 
Abbreviations COX = cyclooxygenase; HF = human fibroblasts; NL = normal lungs; IPF = idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; IFN = interferon; IL = interleukin; PG = prostaglandin; TX = thromboxane; PGI 2 = prostacyclin. 
Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands, marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring.

Cycladic Culture At around 3500 b.c. 
The people farmed and fished; on the dawning of the Bronze Age in 2700 b.c. 
The Cycladic culture was influenced by societies in the east, importing the pottery wheel from Mesopotamia. 
The Minoans and the Myceneans Farther south in Crete, the Minoan culture developed after 2000 b.c. 
Santorini (Thira), the next major island north, was heavily influenced by Crete, and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time. 
Around 1500 b.c. 
Massive tidal waves swept over Crete, and other parts of the Mediterranean, smashing buildings and drowning many thousands of people. 
), who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland. 
Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad. 
They were a barbaric race, and their custody of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word was forgotten and art disappeared. 
At the same time, city-states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland. 
However, Greece was not yet a country; each city-state was self-governing and autonomous. 
Culture and the arts flourished once again. 
, to promote friendly competition. 
The preeminent islands of this era were Delos, a sacred island and center of religion ruled by Athens; Samos, ruled by the tyrant Polycrates; and Naxos, whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major building projects. 
The Persian Wars As Athens rose in influence and power in the West, it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire. 
In 490 b.c. 
The two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and Salamis in 480 b.c. 
Following its victory, Athens introduced the concept of a mutual protection alliance (a kind of NATO of the ancient world). 
The alliance became known as the Delian League. 
Later, in 454 b.c. 
In 431 b.c. 
Although the islands saw little action, as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power. 
, many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors, who were led by Philip II of Macedon. 
by his son Alexander the Great, one of the most remarkable leaders in history. 
Following Alexander’s death, his lands were divided among his generals. 
Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan. 
, Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands, the next major power change brought influence from the West. 
The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity The Romans ruled a pagan empire, but the Aegean had an important influence on the early development of Christianity. 
95, St. 
It was here that he wrote what was to become the final book of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation. 
330, however, when the newly converted Emperor Constantine made Byzantium, renamed Constantinople, capital of his Eastern Empire that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek life. 
In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen Muslims, a new potent religious force from the East, the Byzantine army forcefully enlisted the men of the islands. 
Unfortunately, their zeal was not matched by their discrimination. 
Constantinople was taken by Crusader forces in 1204, and they stripped the city of manyof its finest treasures — which now grace the public buildings of Venice — although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell. 
To counter this, the populations moved from their homes on the coast and built settlements inland, out of sight of the raiding parties. 
The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen, many of whom were Genoese or Venetian, such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos. 
The Venetians fortified their main towns — Naxos Town and Antiparos Town are wonderful examples of this — creating labyrinths of narrow alleys and cul-de-sacs that were designed to confuse and to demoralize invaders. 
After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 1309, Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land. 
However, they had not seen the last of their Muslim foe. 
The Coming of the Ottoman Turks The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east, taking land in what is now Turkey. 
In 1453, they took Constantinople, and immediately made it their capital, renaming it Istanbul. 
John and, after an unsuccessful siege in 1480, they finally ejected the knights from the Dodecanese in 1522. 
The Ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled, forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean. 
In 1770, Russia came to aid the Greeks (defined by their Orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries), declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774. 
Although this attempt was unsuccessful, the campaign for a Greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in strength. 
Lesvos, Chios, and Samos lay in the important shipping lanes, and patriots began disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic. 
The Ottoman Empire was weakening, however, and in 1821, the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time. 
A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout the Aegean, thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the disparate Orthodox populations. 
The Turks lost a short war with Italy, and were forced to relinquish the Dodecanese islands to the Italians. 
He promised a modern state for his people, but as the situation became volatile, civil strife broke out in Turkish cities, and those considered Greek were victims of threats and violence. 
Thousands of people arrived with little more than the clothes they wore, putting great strain on the resources of the islands. 
Greece attempted to stay out of World War II, but Mussolini saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire. 
Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the islands. 
But the country was politically fragmented, with arguments between monarchists and republicans, right and left, and tension escalated into civil war. 
Even after the fighting stopped more than a decade later, the country was not stable. 
The Aegean Islands, which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes, became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse. 
The EU has given large subsidies to develop Greece’s infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient monuments. 
Private investment has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible. 
As the Balkans flared to war once again, Greek nationalism has stirred, and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers. 
, Jerusalem was a Canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route, far less important than biblical cities such as Hazor, Megiddo, Beth Shean, and Shechem. 
” Scholars speculate that Shalim might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace, for the name resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for “peace”: shalom and salaam, respectively. 
The city is not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet warrior, King David, who captured the city from the Jebusites in about 1000 b.c. 
Warren’s Shaft, part of a Canaanite water system discovered by 19th-century archaeologists and open to visitors, might be the very tunnel infiltrated by David’s army. 
on Mt. 
At the Temple’s dedication, Solomon addressed his God: “... 
” The site of the Temple eventually became identified as Mt. 
Along with this splendid house of worship, Solomon built a royal palace, mansions for his wives, temples for the foreign gods worshipped by the princesses he had married, and towers for the defense of the capital. 
The Temple and royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with cedar from Lebanon; the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3,000 years. 
The Bible tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms aroused the fury of the great Prophets. 
the Assyrian armies of Sennacherib destroyed Israel and moved southward to besiege Jerusalem. 
The end of David’s dynasty came in 587 b.c. 
When it fell, the Temple and all the buildings were burned. 
” In time, the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b.c. 
The Second Temple was finished in 515 b.c. 
Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in 332 b.c. 
When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism, Jews led by Judah Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b.c. 
The Macabbees cleansed the Temple of Hellenistic idols and the blood of pagan sacrifices; the eight-day celebration of Hanukkah (Feast of Dedication) commemorates their victory. 
Jerusalem grew, surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside the Jaffa Gate. 
, during which time he fortified the Hasmonean wall and rebuilt the defense towers beside Jaffa Gate, the foundation of which still stand. 
Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple, making it one of the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire. 
One of these walls, the Western Wall, is today a major reminder of Jerusalem’s greatness under Herod. 
For all his accomplishments, Herod was nevertheless hated by his subjects; he taxed, he tortured, and he ordered the massacre of male Jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded Messiah. 
, Joseph and Mary escaped Herod’s paranoia by fleeing into Egypt with the new-born infant. 
According to biblical accounts, Jesus spent his life ministering in the Galilee Valley. 
30 he and his followers went for Passover to Jerusalem, which was in unrest at this time, dissatisfied with Roman domination. 
Jesus was put on trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion, a Roman form of execution for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals. 
After Jesus’s crucifixion, harsh Roman rule continued until a.d. 
For four years Jewish zealots fought against the might of Rome. 
70, finally attacking its starved and weakened defenders. 
The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed. 
Half a million civilians died in the Galilee and Judea as a result of this first revolt against Rome, a number unequaled in ancient warfare. 
In outrage, the Jews began a second revolt against Rome, led by Simon bar Kochba. 
The planned new Roman city, Aelia Capitolina, was built over the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem, and Jews were barred from residing there for all time. 
Queen Helena, a devout Christian and the mother of Emperor Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 326 to identify the sites associated with Jesus’s life. 
The temple was demolished and a vast, Classical-style church was built around Golgotha (the hill where Jesus’s crucifixion was believed to have taken place). 
Pilgrims came from all over the Roman (and, later, Byzantine) Empire during the following centuries, but the prosperity they brought lasted only until 614, when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced Jerusalem to rubble again. 
From here the Prophet ascended to the heavens and was permitted to glimpse paradise. 
The Dome of the Rock remains Jerusalem’s most striking monument; it is counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created. 
Jerusalem continued under Islamic rule for the next four and a half centuries. 
Crusaders, Mamelukes, and Turks The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head. 
During the Sixth Crusade (1228– 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation. 
After they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years. 
Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times. 
In the 1890s, Theodor Herzl (1860–1904) worked to organize a movement, Zionism, to create a Jewish state. 
Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the British government that led to the Balfour Declaration of 1917, supporting the idea of a Jewish “national home” in Palestine that also respected the rights of existing non-Jewish people already living there. 
In 1922 the League of Nations granted the British a mandate to administer Palestine. 
Modern neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, and the Hebrew University were built in West Jerusalem, the new Jewish enclave. 
In 1947 the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with Jerusalem as an international city that belonged to neither. 
Modern Israel The State of Israel was declared during this difficult time. 
West Jerusalem, separated from the rest of the new Jewish nation, held out under siege for several months until Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the coastal areas. 
As a result of armistice agreements in 1949, Jerusalem was divided: West Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control, and East Jerusalem (including the Old City, with its Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters) came under Jordanian authority. 
However, with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire, no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem’s mayor, Teddy Kollek, spent the next 25 years orchestrating a vast program of development, adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the concerns of Jerusalem’s many communities. 
But the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present-day Jerusalem as it continues to tug at the world’s attention into the new millennium. 
, when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. 
The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. 
Fossils tell an obscure story of man’s slow and sporadic development. 
, native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. 
These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. 
Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. 
Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. 
Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 
Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi, the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived, changing the nature of existence in the valley forever. 
It was not until 1829 that Rafael Rivera, a Mexican scout, found a spring-fed valley and dubbed it Las Vegas — a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where “the meadows” really lay. 
This put Las Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history. 
Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert, the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years. 
Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries’ plight beyond recovery. 
Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver, by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold. 
Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day, Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off — at least when it came to ranching and farming. 
He expanded the ranch and irrigated the land so that it would support crops and cattle. 
Despite his ambition, Gass’ success was short-lived. 
True to wild-West stereotypes, Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer, leaving his strong-willed wife, Helen, to assume the duties of the ranch. 
What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day. 
Of Tracks and Tracts At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West. 
Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair. 
The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes. 
Land speculators and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad boomtown, and within an afternoon, more than 80 percent of the lots were sold. 
With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property, it was ready to become a real town. 
The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place. 
But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. 
These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. 
Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. 
Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. 
The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. 
They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. 
Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night). 
Additional catalysts for the valley’s growth came from World War II. 
By 1945, the population had grown to almost 20,000, with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace. 
During this period, East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel earned a foothold as a local casino operator. 
When the Flamingo opened in December 1946, it did so with Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash. 
Despite its initial failings, Siegel’s Flamingo survived him, as did mob infiltration of casinos. 
Freely flowing “comps” (complimentary food, drink, and entertainment) were the order of the day, with mob bosses content to provide an environment of pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in. 
From the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s, Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that it was the “Entertainment Capital of the World. 
Many of them did. 
The Rat Pack — originally Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. 
Other Hollywood stars came as well, simply because Las Vegas was the place to be. 
The Thunderbird, Desert Inn, Sahara, Sands, and Riviera hotels were erected during this period, luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of all-night partying, exclusive entertainment, and cheap accommodations. 
New Legitimacy Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. 
True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn’s penthouse. 
Thus began Hughes’ legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. 
Hughes’ actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. 
Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. 
In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. 
Wynn’s demolition of the existing properties started a trend that, more than any other, describes Las Vegas at the end of the 20th century: removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones. 
Wynn’s casinos have also set new standards. 
Excalibur, the MGM Grand, the Luxor, and New York-New York all followed Mirage’s lead during the 1990s, offering themed environments and attractions for families. 
The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob era: the comprehensive resort. 
Additionally, a handful of resorts — such as the South-Seas themed Mandalay Bay, the Mirage, and the new Four Seasons — are now catering exclusively to the luxury travel market. 
The world’s most expensive resort at $1.6 billion, the Bellagio’s amenities include 5-star dining, Chanel-caliber boutiques, and a world-class collection of artistic masterworks. 
As it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming venue, the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed. 
Recent business projections for Las Vegas predict challenges; tourism revenues must increase substantially to sustain what is already built, while actual figures show visitation as steady or declining. 
Still, the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else. 
Dublin and the Dubliners As capital of Europe’s most explosive economy, Dublin seems to be changing before your very eyes. 
At night the streets are crowded with people bent on having a good time. 
But this is not the whole picture. 
This busy, modern European city sits on a thousand years of history — history is present everywhere, from elegant Merrion Square to the bullet holes on the General Post Office. 
Dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor. 
Old buildings are being recycled; for example, the 17th-century Royal Hospital now holds the Museum of Modern Art. 
City on the Liffey The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center of the city to Dublin Bay. 
This geography is important in understanding Dublin. 
The occasional cry of gulls and unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by the sea, and the Wicklow mountains, which hold Dublin closely to the coast, are visible from everywhere. 
To the south and east is St. 
Along the Liffey to the west is Temple Bar, center of nightlife and home to many of Dublin’s cutting-edge artists and artistic endeavors. 
It won’t rain on you in Dublin all the time. 
Joyce, the high priest of literary Modernism, imagined and interpreted Dublin for the world in Ulysses (you’ll see references to it all over). 
The city’s impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of U2 and Bob Geldof is well known — there’s even a self-guided tour of their haunts. 
And in this city, where literature and theater have historically dominated the scene, visual arts are finally coming into their own with the new Museum of Modern Art and the many galleries that display the work of modern Irish artists. 
And while multinational chains have made inroads, they seem less blatant here than elsewhere. 
Dublin’s food has undergone a metamorphosis. 
City and Countryside In a city of such human proportions it is not surprising that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation. 
The beautiful Wicklow Mountains, and the Wicklow Mountains National Park provide a more rugged countryside, and the area has breathtaking houses and gardens such as Castletown, Mount Usher, and Powerscourt. 
The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) runs north and south along the coast. 
There are many guided bus tours to sights outside the city, and some are accessible by city bus. 
Dublin is a young city. 
The universities attract students from all over the world, and this influx helps to make Dublin a busy, buzzing international city. 
Unemployment is at an all-time low. 
Hong Kong and Its People Exciting, mysterious, glamorous — these words have described Hong Kong for at least a century. 
Hong Kong is crowded — it has one of the world’s greatest population densities. 
Shopping never ends — there’s always another inviting spot just down the street. 
On 1 July, 1997 the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. 
But in fact, there have been changes, many of them due to economic progress, new construction, and other factors that influence cities all over the world. 
British social customs are still evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour. 
With a population of nearly eight million and a total area of just over 1,095 square km (423 square miles), housing is one of Hong Kong’s perennial nightmares. 
Whole cities have been created in the New Territories, although the unimaginative architecture of these towns has been criticized. 
The majority are Cantonese, born in Hong Kong, or from South China, but there are immigrants from all over China. 
There are many stories of refugees who arrived with nothing in their pockets, set up a small sidewalk stall, worked diligently until they had their own store, and then expanded it into a modest chain. 
Hong Kong has two major racetracks as well as an intensive off-track betting system, and on weekends the ferries to Macau are crowded with people on their way to the casinos. 
Views of the city and the harbor are panoramic. 
The business and financial center and the signature soaring architecture are on Hong Kong Island. 
Beyond, in the New Territories, are a mixture of high-rise suburban towns, ancient sites and walled villages, country parks, and farms with ducks and fish ponds. 
You can also take a ferry to Macau to find an entirely different kind of city, a unique blend of Chinese and Iberian culture. 
What to Do Shopping Inflation has taken its toll in Hong Kong. 
Since Hong Kong is a duty-free port and charges no sales tax, goods are cheaper here than in the country where they were made. 
Specialty goods and souvenirs, often handmade, come from Hong Kong and elsewhere in China. 
Note that alcohol and tobacco are both exceptions to Hong Kong’s duty-free regime and are subject to tax. 
Large shops on the fashionable thoroughfares tend to be more expensive than smaller “family” shops tucked away in the side streets. 
Most shops are open seven days a week. 
The only holiday on which all commerce comes to a halt is the Chinese New Year in January or February. 
Be aware that name brands, including electronics, are sometimes fakes, glass may be sold as jade, and that antique you bought may have been made last night. 
Needless to say, avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take you to wondrous bargains. 
Compare prices before you buy any significant item. 
Note that when haggling, the merchant assumes you are prepared to pay cash. 
It is advisable to shop at outlets that are members of the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), identified by a red junk logo.

Major shopping areas are Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon, especially along Nathan Road; Central on Hong Kong Island, particularly for upscale designer goods; Causeway Bay for slightly better prices; and the Hollywood Road area. 
Look for Lane Crawford Ltd., an upscale store with branches at Pacific Place, 70 Queen’s Road, and Harbour City; Wing On, one of the oldest in Hong Kong; Marks and Spencer; and the Japanese department stores, Mitsukoshi, Sobo, and Seibu. 
In addition, most top-line hotels have upscale malls full of designer boutiques. 
These stores sell excess stock or factory overruns. 
There are factory showrooms in the Pedder Building, 12 Pedder Street, in Central. 
Markets are the places to use your bargaining skills. 
Every conceivable kind of goods is sold here: clothing, all kinds of electronics, CDs, souvenirs, crafts, and jewelry. 
Bargain, and carefully examine any merchandise you buy here. 
This is not the place to make expensive purchases, but it’s great for inexpensive pendants, earrings, and gifts. 
The experts point out that it is not age alone that determines a Chinese antique’s value — the dynasties of the past had their creative ups and downs.

around the Coast Aberdeen, the island’s oldest settlement, once a pirate lair, is home to the “floating population” — the boat people who spend their entire lives on the junks in the harbor, some proudly claiming never to have set foot on land (except for funerals, which don’t count). 
The boats may appear deceptively primitive, but many of them have their own electric generators and all the modern conveniences. 
You can take a tour of the port in one of the small sampans, propelled by hand by women drivers. 
Aberdeen’s theatrical floating restaurants have been a tourist attraction for many years. 
It is divided into three areas: a highland, a lowland, and the Middle Kingdom.

Just across Salisbury Road from the cultural center is the historic Peninsula Hotel, now expanded and modernized by a 32-story tower. 
Alongside the hotel runs busy Nathan Road, Hong Kong’s fabled shopping street, lined with shops, hotels, and restaurants. 
At the time it was built, many thought it absurd to have a tree-lined boulevard running through what was practically a wilderness. 
” A few blocks up Nathan Road is Kowloon Park (open daily 6am–midnight), elegantly laid out with fountains, promenades, and ornamental gardens; be sure to go up the steps to see the Sculpture Walk. 
Turn off Nathan and walk down Kansu Street to find the Jade Market (open 10am–3pm; see page 80), with more than 100 stalls spread out in a large tent, just before you reach the overpass.

This is the most easily accessible of the New Territories’ walled villages. 
Kat Hing Wai was built four or five centuries ago by the Hakka Tang clan, one of the Five Great Clans that migrated here from North China (see page 11). 
The Tang clan’s earliest walled village was Lo Wai, which also has its defensive wall intact and is entered by a narrow gate. 
Few traditional ancestral halls remain in China since the anti-historical destruction during the Cultural Revolution, so these New Territories ancestral halls are rare survivors.

The preservation of this wonderful home is ongoing; a projected restoration of the original garden is still in progress. 
The highway and the railway stay close together from Fanling, site of the best golf courses in the area.

Also here is the Hongkong Heritage Museum (call Tel. 
The museum has an art collection, and displays of toys and other artifacts. 
Opposite the Sha Tin railway station, New Town Plaza features shops, cinemas, and even a computer-controlled musical fountain.

Closer to town is Lion Rock, shaped like a lion lying in wait. 
The Islands Excursion companies sell a variety of orientation cruises of Hong Kong harbor that include a look at some of its 235 outlying islands. 
From the ferry terminals on Hong Kong Island you can escape to islands without cars or cares, where the local people smile “hello” and, if you’re lucky, point you to a secret beach for the ultimate in quality leisure time. 
Chek Lap Kok airport sits on reclaimed land just off Lantau; plans to build a bridge may change Lantau, but at present it is sparsely populated and makes a perfect getaway. 
More than half the island is parkland, and there is a 70-km (45-mile) circular hiking trail (see page 92). 
There are also ferries to Discovery Bay. 
The monastery is strictly vegetarian, and visitors are warned not to bring any meat with them. 
From the monastery, hikers enjoy the two-hour cross-country trek down to Silvermine Bay, but the authorities have warned walkers to be on the lookout for snakes, which can be plentiful in the Lantau hinterland, especially in summer. 
The people of this picturesque village make their living by fishing, duck-breeding, and food-processing. 
A Trappist monastery, situated on a hillside overlooking the east coast of Lantau, is also open to visitors. 
Cheung Chau Some 10 km (6 miles) west of Hong Kong lies this small, crowded island, only one square mile in size. 
The people still carve jade and build seaworthy junks, all by hand. 
Cheung Chau becomes the center of Hong Kong life once a year, usually in May, during the Bun Festival, a folklore extravaganza (see page 89). 
By way of formal tourist attractions, Pak Tai Temple, built in 1783, has some fine carvings and a great iron sword said to be 600 years old. 
There are also several open-air restaurants where you can enjoy fresh seafood. 
Hong Kong’s third largest island has a population of only about 12,000; it is still largely undeveloped, and life on Lamma, if not totally primitive, is close to the essentials. 
” The principal settlements are Yung Shue Wan on Lamma’s northwest, and Sok Kwu Wan, on the east coast. 
Yung Shue Wan is still a very British residential enclave, with many nice pubs. 
Here, where East and West first met, life combines the spirit of Asia with something of the sunny atmosphere of the Mediterranean. 
Col­­o­n­na­­ded public buildings, iron balconies, winding streets, flagstoned squares and the many churches all speak of the Portuguese inheritance as well as the Chinese, a fusion of East and West that has produced the unique Macanese culture. 
It was the only European gateway to China, and through Macau flowed Western technology and religion. 
No less impressive were the secular challenges. 
The Dutch sent an invasion flotilla to Macau in 1622, but the defenders triumphed. 
China began to relax trade restrictions, and with the rise of Hong Kong, Macau became an isolated Portuguese outpost. 
They were joined by a swarm of spies of all conceivable nationalities, and Macau won a name for international intrigue. 
Macau’s population is estimated at around 450,000, an appallingly high figure for such a small area; recent land reclamation has eased the situation to some extent. 
Gambling provides almost 40 percent of the government’s tax revenues, and is a major source of employment. 
Arriving The easiest way to get to Macau is by jetfoil, operated by TurboJet (Tel. 
Macau’s own currency, the pataca, is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar, and you can use your Hong Kong currency freely in Macau.

For an authentic feel of old Portugal, slip into the cool entrance hall of theimpressive Leal Senado (“Loyal Senate” building), a fine example of colonial architecture. 
The inscription over the archway reads, “Cidade do nome de Deus, não ha outra mais leal” (“City of the Name of God, None is More Loyal”) — a bit of praise attributed to Portugal’s King John IV in the 17th century. 
Macau’s most memorable monument is the Baroque façade of the ruins of São Paulo, the only remains of a beautiful 17th-century Jesuit church. 
Beneath the church, the Museum of Sacred Art houses a collection of sacramental objects. 
Entrance is by escalator, near St. 
It gives an overview of Macau’s history and its daily life and traditions. 
The fort, built by the Jesuits in the 17th century as a defense against the Dutch, was largely destroyed by the same fire that burned St. 
Next to the museum, behind a gate (opened to anyone who knocks), is the Old Protestant Cemetery. 
The small, whitewashed chapelwas the first Protestant church built in China. 
Here, arched bridges, pagodas, fish ponds, and stands of bamboo create the mood of a timeless Chinese painting. 
Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Chinese Republic. 
Kun Iam Tong, off Avenida do Coronel Mesquita (open daily 8am–6pm), is a 17th-century Buddhist temple of considerable splendor and charm. 
Another important ceremony took place in 1999 when Macau became part of China.

James is said to have stepped down from the altar and halted an invasion. 
The northernmost point in Macau is the frontier between two contrasting worlds. 
Trying Your Luck Macau’s casinos are a source of non-stop excitement. 
The casinos offer familiar international games — baccarat, blackjack, boule, craps, roulette — along with more exotic Chinese pastimes. 
Dai-Siu (Big and Small) is a dice game in which the croupier throws three dice inside a glass container. 
They keep busy 24 hours a day, but if you want a change of scene there are always more gambling opportunities available. 
Market prices per tael (34 grams/1.2 ounces) of gold are set daily. 
Browsing is a real pleasure in Macau’s main streets and byways, where shops aimed at the tourist market are interspersed with the more workaday ironmongers, herbalists, and noodle stalls. 
However, you are not likely to find bargains, and you should be aware that unless you are an expert, you can end up with a fake. 
Food and Drink Gourmets award Macau high marks for dependable Chinese cooking with an exotic bonus: Portuguese food and wines. 
Whether you choose to dine in one of the Macanese, Chinese, traditional Portuguese, or international-style restaurants, you will be treated to a hearty meal at a good price. 
A delicate, delicious fish is Macau sole (linguado). 
Macau has an ample supply of Portuguese wines. 
After dinner, a glass of Madeira or port is recommended to round off the meal. 
Taipa and Coloane Bridges link Macau with its two islands. 
The quaint Taipa Village, with its narrow lanes and colonial buildings painted yellow, blue, and green, has almost been completely swallowed up by the development of nearby housing projects. 
Pay a visit to the Casa Museu da Taipa, and you’ll be able to get a glimpse of how Macanese families lived in former days. 
” Farther away is Coloane, connected to Taipa by a causeway and a large land reclamation project. 
Cheoc Van and Hac Sa (“Black Sands”) are both popular resort areas, with lifeguards on duty in summer and windsurfing boards for rent. 
The village of Coloane is picturesque, with a central square lined with cafés. 
The small Chapel of St. 
Seac Pai Van Park, on the west coast of the island is an interesting natural preserve with aNatural History Museum. 
The city still maintains its important gateway role. 
Guangzhou, with a population of more than 5 million, straddles the Pearl River — China’s fifth longest — which links the city to the South China Sea. 
The river also irrigates the carefully tended surrounding farmlands, creating a beautifully lush, subtropical scene. 
Guangzhou today is mostly about business and industry, featuring new development, skyscrapers, a whole new business area, and raised expressways. 
Guangzhou is interestingly one of China’s most prosperous cities, determinedly on the move into the modern world. 
Arriving in Guangzhou There are many package tours to Guangzhou from Hong Kong (see page 113), and this may be the easiest way to visit the city. 
Citibus also travels to Guangzhou from CHKC; there are five round-trips a day, taking 31/2 hours. 
Hong Kong currency is widely accepted in Guangzhou, or you can change your currency into RMB (yuan) at any bank or hotel. 
If you travel by train, you will arrive at the Guangzhou East Station, a large modern complex, which connects with the subway, buses, hotel transfer services, and taxis. 
Sights in Guangzhou Yuexiu Park, situated near the Trade Fair in the northern part of the city, is Guangzhou’s largest; it covers a hilly 100 hectares (247 acres). 
In the park is the 1380 Zhenhai Tower, one of the city’s oldest buildings.

Guangzhou’s most important Buddhist monument is the 1,400-year-old Temple of the Six Banyan Trees (open 8am–5pm). 
Golden Buddha statues in several of Buddha’s aspects adorn the temples, and overlooking them is the 17-story Flower Pagoda, a slender relic of the Song dynasty (a.d. 
In the early Middle Ages, Canton had a significant Muslim population as a result of its trade with the Middle East. 
627. 
The modern minaret is known as the “Plain (or Naked) Pagoda,” in contrast to the Flower Pagoda of the Buddhist temple. 
An architectural wonder, it is itself a beautiful piece of craftsmanship with its sculpture and carved stone balustrades. 
Inside is a collection of ceramics, carvings, and furniture.
