For Plaintiffs PATRICK T. 
We are in chambers, and this is the matter of Kitzmiller, of course, versus Dover Area School District. 
Present in chambers are counsel for both the plaintiffs and the defendants, and in addition to that, let me ask that you enter your appearances specially, presumably as counsel for the individuals we referred to in our orders collectively as "reporters." I'm here, Niles Benn, on behalf of both of the reporters, Heidi Bernard-Bubb and Joseph Maldonado. 
Benn's office. 
I'm not here to discuss law. 
I certainly understand the opinion and orders that have been rendered by the Court, and I appreciate them. 
And I really truly believe in my heart of hearts the focus gets misdirected. 
And you initially had indicated that you did not feel that the reporter's privilege stood in this kind of a case. 
But having said that, the concern that I have is that there is a precedent being set in the counties that these people otherwise work. 
First of all, I understand and deeply respect the position that you're in in this case. 
I'm not sure if this is a dialogue. 
That's why we're meeting in chambers. 
That's fine. 
And I thought, when I heard that the reporters, quite frankly, appeared for depositions, that when I was on a break, I was going to hear an accumulated list of questions that were objected to and that I would have to rule on those questions. 
Now, I understand what your reasons are for not doing that, and I think you can do that. 
But my concern is that I have to have some degree of certainty by your order that they can't ask any questions as to unpublished materials. 
I would like to do that, because of my own health conditions, maybe on Friday in terms as to a deposition, if that works within anybody's schedule, and then maybe the latter part of next week. 
I'm not sure. 
But I think I've got to line-draw here someplace. 
When you say "reported" and you're talking about reporters, then I'm thinking, I have enough work in this case. 
But from the reporters' perspective, were they at the meeting. 
We just had dialogue in chambers, the judge is going to be entering an order, and after we receive the order, we'll be able to make a decision in terms of where we proceed. 
We may have others as the trial unfolds. 
Do you have any children? 
Cross-examine, Mr. 
When did you get to court? 
That's when the board passed the resolution that changed the biology curriculum? 
That's correct. 
Excuse me, and beyond the scope of direct. 
We're getting argumentative only because I think the witness and counsel are talking over each other. 
THOMPSON Mrs. 
Give me a sense of which ones you attended. 
And what was your answer? 
What about the York Dispatch? 
"This newsletter has been produced to help explain the changes in the biology curriculum. 
I don't think so. 
Is that correct? 
I did talk to people in the district, other people in the district. 
Beyond the scope of direct, Your Honor. 
Well, I think it is beyond the scope, again, the colorable scope of direct, and I'll sustain the objection. 
Mischaracterizes the testimony. 
What do you do? 
Yes, I did. 
And I went along because I live in the district, I pay taxes in the district, my children attend school in the district. 
Do you recall anything else Mr. 
Tell us what else -- after looking at that article, do you remember anything else that happened at the meeting? 
Yes. 
And I remember talking to my husband about that in the car ride home, as well, because we're both teachers and I was -- when I hear things like that, I immediately think of my students, and I was thinking about the diverse group of students that I have in my classroom, who all have different religious viewpoints, and how difficult that would be to tell one student that, you know, we can't express your belief, but we can express that person's belief in the classroom. 
Now, tell us what you can recall of the June 14th, board meeting. 
Give me one second to think about this. 
I'm wondering if I'm getting my meetings mixed up. 
This is running into a narrative. 
Do you want to finish the answer, or is that your answer? 
Did you attend the meeting on or about October the 18th of 2004? 
And, again, this was a heated meeting. 
No further questions. 
And so she hasn't heard this one-minute statement be read in the class yet? 
I believe you described these meetings as involving some heated exchanges between some board members and the public. 
And the biology textbook that was in question at the time, I believe it was the version of the Miller-Levine biology book. 
Do you have any objections with the book? 
So the only required textbook for that class was that biology book that was creating all the controversy on June 7th and June 14th. 
To my knowledge, the only required book is that book, in addition to supplemental materials that the instructor has. 
Yes. 
No. 
Okay. 
I'm sorry, I wasn't that precise. 
But as for myself walking into a library and seeing them there, I did not. 
Beth Eveland. 
And do you remember how you learned that? 
Excuse me, Your Honor. 
There's no need to restate your objection, unless you want to put a finer point on the objection. 
Yes, I did. 
She is a member of the Dover Area School Board. 
It is a letter from Heather Geesey to the editor in response to my letter. 
Now, if there's not an authentication issue, we'll move on to the second -- Actually, Mr. 
I have agreed that she has authenticated what she did to produce this article. 
But for the purpose of this witness, conditionally and subject to additional argument from counsel, we'll admit the letter and you may proceed. 
Yes, I did. 
Good afternoon. 
She's a second-grader. 
And they wanted to get the most current book instead of wasting money on an older book. 
Yes, they did. 
Not only them, but the vast majority of board members, yes, they were. 
And who is Joe Maldonado? 
I told him I didn't think that that was going to happen." And the next line, Line 3, is a question which states, "When Mr. 
And she's a reporter? 
Petitioners have advanced a particular interpretation of the only express limits in the Copyright Clause designed to give those limits meaning. 
That's right. 
Well, Mr. 
We've said it must be looked to to interpret the scope of "limited times," and unless retrospective extensions are forbidden, it will eviscerate the meaning of "limited times." That does not occur in the context of the scope of exclusive right, nor in the context of the power to secure. 
How does that tie into a retrospective-prospective distinction? 
In 1831 it granted the benefit of its extension to a subset of all subsisting copyright holders. 
-- recall. 
-- then what is your First Amendment argument? 
They cannot give a copyright purely for purposes of distribution to publishers. 
It is one of the -- Mr. 
Just as a limited addition print is not a limited -- is not limited if each time a customer comes in a new print is printed, so, too, a limited term is not limited if each time copyright holders come to Congress they can extend the term. 
Well, I think that to the extent that there may be limitations, Justice Stevens, they are -- require considerable deference by this Court to the judgment of Congress -- Well, I understand that, but do you -- I'd be interested in knowing, do you think it does contain limitations? 
Well, it may provide additional incentives for the patentee to exploit and promote and disseminate that particular work. 
That's uniformity. 
How could it? 
I submit, Justice Souter, that there's no per se limitation, that if there is, as Justice Scalia suggested, for -- if it is true that Congress,having specified 14 years or 28 years, decides that doesn't work very well because of the economies of other countries, the parade of constraints on artists in other countries, the reasons that we want things to be preserved or distributed, it should be 2 more years, or 5 more years later -- Yes, but that argument would apply to new copyrights, but to extension of already existing copyrights your argument doesn't apply. 
That was an part of the bargain. 
Perpetual copyright is not permitted. 
This is subsisting copyrights. 
Are you -- I want you to finish. 
But compare that to thefirst. 
Now, this delicate balance that the Government invokes, Justice Breyer, let me give you the numbers. 
I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. 
Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. 
He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president. 
And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel. 
Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides. 
Is there any difference? 
I think it's a triumph. 
I supported them when they did so. 
I supported the president. 
He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. 
Yes. 
Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide? 
Fine. 
The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. 
During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. 
I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. 
I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. 
I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. 
And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. 
That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about. 
One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces. 
And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America. 
Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America. 
She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. 
I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version. 
I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me. 
And I think that's the way it ought to be. 
That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States. 
How do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of guns? 
I think these assault weapons are a problem. 
I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate. 
Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others. 
Well, it starts with enforcing law. 
One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. 
What's that mean? 
Listen, we've got gun laws. 
Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. 
We believe in tough love. 
I think it ought to be a top priority. 
For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state. 
We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people. 
We're working hard to sign up children. 
Vice President Gore, on the environment. 
Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. 
I think -- 99 to nothing. 
Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable. 
That's an interruption, okay. 
I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong. 
But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money. 
See you next week. 
There is also a buzzer, if it is needed. 
Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected. 
I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. 
I'm not that concerned. 
It's an empty promise. 
Mr. 
You know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual. 
For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. 
I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. 
This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. 
I voted for IRA tax cuts. 
Mr. 
But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question. 
I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman. 
I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it. 
Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. 
I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. 
That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth. 
I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. 
It made a lot of sense. 
Is it the insurance companies? 
And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. 
Senator Kerry? 
But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s. 
I don't force you to do anything. 
But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program. 
Americans ought to have it too. 
First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks. 
And so I think we need to think differently. 
The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees. 
Mr. 
And it is about immigration. 
I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue. 
In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens. 
1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928. 
There are huge delays. 
Next question to you, Senator Kerry. 
The president has denied 9. 
Many inner-city kids just move through. 
That's a new question for Senator -- for President Bush. 
We've increased funds. 
Now, that's not in my gut. 
That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country. 
But I will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries. 
But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America. 
I put people behind bars for the rest of their life. 
We'd have won what Bill Clinton won. 
Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. 
This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus. 
I pray for my little girls. 
But when I make decisions, I stand on principle, and the principles are derived from who I am. 
Senator Kerry, after 9/11 -- and this is a new question for you -- it seemed to me that the country came together as I've never seen it come together since World War II. 
Or what would be your attitude on that? 
I think we have to come together and work to change it. 
Bopped over there. 
They also kick me around. 
I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever. 
Goodnight. 
It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side. 
Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America. 
I want to thank you for listening tonight. 
Before 9/11, terrorism was confined to a small number of extremist individuals, loosely linked by radical Islam and hatred of Israel and its sole supporter, the USA. 
The fact is, Bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism, much less defeat it. 
Brute force has failed in Palestine, and it is failing in Iraq.

Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards. 
Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out? 
I highly doubt it. 
But the real cause here are not the drugs themselves, but poverty and the "war on drugs". 
Virtually every child psychologist knows that mother/child bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities, the awareness of the consequences of one's actions, and the learning of conflict resolution by non-violent means. 
The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned, according to guncite, are: Japan: 0.02 per 100,000 (1994)England/Wales: 0.11 per 100,000 (1997)Germany: 0.22 per 100,000 (1994)Australia: 0.44 per 100,000 (1994)United States: 3.72 per 100,000 (1999) Critics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make -- concluding that gun ownership "leads" to violence. 
It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence -- but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly. 
The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries. 
In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party. 
Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples. 
In the 1990s the rhetoric of "cultural diversity" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole. 
The authenticity of the modern Nasa, who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots, is brought into question by the traditional, who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence(Rappaport 2005). 
The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences. 
Rappaport, Joanne.

Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler. 
These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems. 
Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers, who may then, upon smelling the returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest. 
In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible, these sensors include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors and sonar, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae. 
Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000, consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers. 
The unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier, which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes. 
The first function might look something like this: // Nest Orient // Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs // and returns the location of the nest in degrees. 
A void function release() will perform this same action in reverse. 
The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP.” Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models. 
Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be the final behavior. 
// Foragers will exit the nest upon activation and follow // a trail laid by the patrollers. 
Int “age” is an integer representing the // time since Antie’s last boot, corresponding to the age // of an ant being simulated.

Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg. 
If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example. 
example 6: measures 56-58 (violin 1) example 7: measure 58 (violas, celli, basses); repeated through measure 75 The Exposition Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition, nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears. 
example 9: measures 77-91 (bassoons, horns, lower strings; reduced) example 10: measures 77-91 rebarred to reflect rhythmic pattern We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F—this is made clear from the onset, both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77. 
Rather, we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middleground-level whole-tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2. 
example 19: measures 488-494: the first theme in the recapitulation There is no fine line between music that is “tonal” and music that is “atonal.” Bartók is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality.

Eliminating color was a way of eliminating the decadence of the 18th century. 
28). 
“color was a permanent internal threat, an ever-present inner other which, if unleashed, would be the ruin of everything, the fall of culture. 
WHITE is the color of modern times, the color which dissipates a whole era; our era is perfection, purity, certitude. 
White and black stand out because of color, and color stand out because of white and black. 
311). 
The use of white was proof that man had conquered nature. 
Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society, the wearing of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so. 
Greenberg continues by saying, “Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. 
These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being almost better than reality. 
It is for this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an intellectual process. 
Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard Pillard, an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics. 
In total, 110 pairs of twins (identical and fraternal) and 142 sets of male and their adopted brothers were studied, where at least one of the two had been classified as homosexual, either by self-identification or other means. 
Both believed that homosexual was a result of nature, rather than nurture (Dobbens & Woods). 
Woods generally agreed with Dobbens, and justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one’s nature, rather than nurture, when he commented that “there’s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to anything like [homosexuality]” (Woods).

Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. 
Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. 
In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. 
Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. 
Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man.

In fact, American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports. 
But the Campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding. 
The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component: an actual concrete plan. 
Without funds to drive the efforts, or even a real plan of action, the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than good. 
People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town. 
For example, Struthers is a poor town with a large Slovak population, where education is generally better than in surrounding towns, but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread. 
A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement, because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together. 
The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons: the failure of the international steel market, the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear, and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies.

The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between compromise and capitulation, between symbols and substance.

Shelton told us the administration reviewed all the Pentagon's war plans and challenged certain assumptions underlying them, as any prudent organization or leader should do. 
(CENTCOM also began dusting off plans for a full invasion of Iraq during this period, Franks said.) The CENTCOM commander told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi moves shortly after 9/11, both because he personally felt that Iraq and al Qaeda might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that Saddam might take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern or southern parts of Iraq, where the United States was flying regular missions to enforce Iraqi no-fly zones. 
By early December, all major cities had fallen to the coalition.

Our work on this issue has given us insight that I believe will be helpful to you. 
We applaud Senator Jeffords for tackling this important issue and for recognizing that a cap and trade program is the best way to achieve these reductions. 
During this time, gross domestic product has increased almost 160%. 
Problems associated with sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury emissions are of national and international significance, and the interstate and long range transport of emissions continue to play significant roles in the nature and magnitude of the problems. 
In 1999, the electric power industry was responsible for 67% of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25% of nitrogen oxide emissions, and 37% of mercury emissions in the United States. 
Since states now know that EPA has authority to address transport pollution through responses to 126 petitions or by issuing a rule like the NOx SIP Call, we anticipate that states will be turning to these types of control approaches early in the SIP process. 
Up-front knowledge of future requirements for multiple pollutants would lead firms to follow significantly different and less expensive compliance strategies at individual plants, compared with compliance choices which must be made as requirements are addressed in a sequential manner under the current law. 
Caps ensure that environmental goals are met. 
Under the Acid Rain cap and trade program, we have not seen local hot spots because the highest emitters are often the most cost-effective to control and therefore, the most likely to control. 
Governor Whitman and I both believe consensus on the appropriate levels and timing for reductions of NOx, SO2 and mercury is achievable relatively soon. 
Some on Wall Street and in Washington with a stake in the status quo may be tempted to wipe from memory the events of this crisis, or to suggest that no one could have foreseen or prevented them. 
It is an attempt to record history, not to rewrite it, nor allow it to be rewritten. 
While the vulnerabilities that created the potential for crisis were years in the making, it was the collapse of the housing bubble—fueled by low interest rates, easy and available credit, scant regulation, and toxic mortgages— that was the spark that ignited a string of events, which led to a full-blown crisis in the fall of 2008.

government does not consider the Chilean seabass to be endangered. 
That is potentially a problem because Chilean seabass are a long-lived species -- living as long as 50 years -- and reproduce slowly, said Susan Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the federal government's National Marine Fisheries Service. 
The conservation groups providing information to chefs and retailers and lists of environmentally appropriate seafoods to consumers are the same groups working to affect fisheries management on the political and regulatory level, Moore said. 
"We have seen that raising consumer awareness and concern among restaurants and retailers about a particular fishery can really make a difference." " (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) The Monterey Bay Aquarium's Web site rates different species of fish for overfishing, habitat damage and other factors. 
I don't have enough information to know, for example, if Chilean seabass is really disappearing or if it's political pressure." Despite being uncertain of its status, Ripert pulled Chilean seabass.

Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view. 
And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind. 
The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered, context-dependent set of causal implications of the event, or signal, in question. 
This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our "hypotheses to die in our stead." I love that image. 
I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations.

The word Zozobra translates to “gloom” or “worry” or “anguished.” The Zozobra is ritualistically burned at the beginning of the fiesta, which symbolizes the end of destructiveness, gloom, and worry, setting the tone for a successful fiesta. 
The effect will resemble monoclinal tilting (Figure 2.1F, G). 
However, this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behavior. 
NULL Figure 2.4 The range of alluvial channel patterns for the three channel types: (A) bed-load channel patterns, (B) mixed-load channel patterns, (C) suspended-load channel patterns (from Schumm, 1981). 
Rivers may undergo a metamorphosis during which the channel morphology changes completely. 
Drainage networks The arrangement of streams and tributaries into a drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern develops, climate, and the erodibility of the surface material. 
Subsidence in the Chattahoochee Embayment and adjacent warping along the Chattahoochee Uplift resulted in asymmetrical incision along the Chattahoochee River. 
(See Chapter 5 where Reelfoot Lake and the Mississippi valley sunklands are described; Figures 5.1, 5.2). 
Terraces The vertical warping of terraces, as a result of deformation, has been studied by numerous investigators (Machida, 1960; Zuchiewicz, 1980; King and Stein, 1983). 
River response The clearest evidence for tectonic effects on rivers are anomalous reaches that show dramatic changes of pattern trend and gradient that cannot be attributed to other causes. 
Another fallacy in Lane’s argument is the assumption that the valley slope and channel gradient are identical. 
Further evidence for the type of channel response shown in Figure 2.13 is demonstrated by the experimental studies of Jeff Ware (1992 oral comm.). 
When the main river crosses this fan, pattern changes will result, as the river attempts to maintain a constant gradient. 
Experimental studies and field observations confirm that a change of valley-floor slope will cause a change of channel morphology. 
Therefore, an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone. 
A complex web of relationships emerges from numerous exchanges among individuals, teams, and employers. 
According to Weick (1996), careers unfold through successive cycles of enactment, selection, and retention, whereby the enactment of careers gives rise to broader organising of work arrangements. 
The high pace of technology and product life cycles, fluidity of firm formation and failure, rapid employee turnover resulting in little com-pany-specific socialisation, as well as a lack of meaningful institutionally based hierarchy, all contribute to an environment in which individuals rely on alternative cues to guide their behaviour. 
New firms form almost overnight -and many disappear just as quickly.

The independent film-making industry Like the Silicon Valley, the independent film-making industry is noted for its innovative ability, cutting edge creativity, and overall economic success. 
Independent film production has thrived as a superior organising model to its in-house predecessor (Jones, 1996). 
Not only do we observe distinct stages of careers, we see aggregate social norms influencing behaviour. 
Agency provides direction and drive to career behaviour and helps to diffuse ambiguity by providing vision and long-term goals.

Billings, an ex-army physician, was responsible for organizing the Surgeon General’s Library and a celebrated medical index. 
All three entrants shared a sense of what was beautiful and what was appropriate, and all were concerned with conveying the same message of permanence, dignity, and of culture rooted in the past. 
It can be relentlessly avant-garde, like the new $1.5 billion national library in Paris, where the books are housed in four L-shaped 22-story glass towers, and the readers are lodged in underground rooms, which the London Times described as “a series of rectangular salons (identical of course) where you can admire the ultra-smooth gray concrete, steel grille ceilings and the expanses of African veneer.”1 A new library can be comfortably Modernist, like the new British Library in London, which the Independent humorously described as “a giant municipal building that has made its way from Scandinavia, having crashed headfirst through an English brickworks on the way.”2 Tom Beeby’s handsome Harold T. 
After all, most of the rules that govern building design—fire codes, building codes, zoning laws, budgets, programmatic requirements, engineering norms—are outside the architect’s control; stylistic rules are firmly within his purview. 
Mies van der Rohe’s steel-and-glass style likewise prevailed for more than two decades, and his characteristic I-beam window mullion can still be seen in contemporary curtain walls. 
This sense of technique carried over to English, and the original meaning of style was those features of literary composition that belonged to the form rather than to the substance of the matter being expressed. 
Although architecture is often defined in terms of abstractions such as space, light, and volume, buildings are above all physical artifacts. 
Railings have a simple function—they must be sturdy enough to support us if we lean on them, and they must provide a secure hand-hold: if railings are open, the spaces between the supports and the rails should be small enough to prevent children from falling through. 
Balusters—little columns—can have a single or a double swelling curve, or a vase shape. 
I have seen a short stair railing that consisted of a single bronze bar, bent at each end to form the uprights. 
Pei designed for the East Building of the National Gallery. 
“The aesthetic understanding [of architecture],” writes Roger Scruton, “is inseparable from a sense of detail.”9 Mies van der Rohe is supposed to have said “God is in the details.”* He did not mean that details are functionally important (although they are), or that good details prolong the life of a building (although they do). 
Yes, fantasy. 
His buildings, extremely light and assembled from standardized elements, were real “machines for living.” Norten, too, is preoccupied with industrial building technologies, the lighter the better. 
This is an unsentimental idea of the home. 
That fear, at least, seems to me to be ill-founded. 
Until then, he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years, building shopping centers, suburban offices, department stores, and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of L.A. 
He was moderately successful, achieving local renown for the Tribune Building, an early New York skyscraper. 
Hunt died in 1895, but in the last seven years of his life, he completed more than fifty projects. 
Although he modeled the building on Blois, he makes no attempt to create a replica of the sixteenth-century chateau, but draws details from other buildings of the period and recombines them into an original whole. 
“The plan is the generator” preached Le Corbusier, but with Gehry, the plan is the result. 
The world of Gehry’s buildings is, at first glance, an odd place.

The goal is to determine whether analyses based on years of life (YOL) or on YHL would provide substantively different results, and which measure would yield more powerful evaluations of weight modification interventions in older adults. 
That is, a person's adjusted YOL is his residual from the regression plus the grand mean. 
Adjusted YHL was calculated in a similar manner. 
Among males, there were significant differences between black and white for BMI, unintended weight loss, YOL, YHL, years of unhealthy life, and years lost to death. 
Figure 1is a plot of adjusted YOL and YHL by sex and BMI. 
YHL and YOL have similar effect sizes for women, and are significantly different from zero. 
This is particularly important in the light of recent findings, which found that interventions such as weight-loss drugs may be harmful [ 33 34 ] .

Characterization of EPR species from VO 2+-AMPCP bound to sCD39 Figure 3ashows the parallel features of the EPR spectrum of sCD39 bound VO 2+-AMPCP. 
The probable combination of carboxyl groups and phosphates for species D1 is one carboxyl group and two phosphates since VO 2+complexes ADP through two phosphates before VO 2+-ADP is bound to the enzyme.

Previous studies have noted Gad expression outside of the CNS. 
We detected weak staining in the heart and did not detect blood vessel expression, perhaps due to the very low levels of expression in developing vasculature [ 27].

Liver biopsies, done in 8 patients, disclosed post-viral chronic active hepatitis (3), cryptogenic cirrhosis (2), and one case each of post-viral cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis. 
The prevalence suggested in previous reports ranges from 6 to 58 %, but the definition of hepatic disease varies from the unspecific (e.g. 
While we could not find an association between use of NSAIDS or other medications and prevalence of liver function tests abnormalities, the study design did not allow us to exclude the possibility of over-the-counter (OTC) medication use that could have affected LFT's measurement.

It is possible that the difference seen in our study between HF-IPF and HF-NL could result from comparing fibroblasts of different ages. 
In our study we found that both COX-2 protein expression and PGE 2 production were upregulated to a similar degree in IPF and normal lung fibroblasts.
