WITOLD J. 
The Court was advised that yesterday, on September the 27th, the reporters, both of them, showed up at the appointed times for their depositions as appropriately scheduled by the defendants, and I'm advised -- and I'll correct this if I'm wrong -- that both reporters cited the reporter's privilege that they consider to exist under the First Amendment so that they would not answer any questions at those depositions. 
As a result of that, Mr. 
Mr. 
That's not my intention. 
I will swear them in, I will have them sworn in. 
Especially after your last opinion on my case, I don't want to call you at all. 
I'm willing to have them testify as to what they wrote in the article and basically forget the affidavit. 
We could only hope not. 
And how I then distinguish this case from maybe my next case is, where an affidavit is provided and the Court or the parties don't accept the affidavit. 
You're trying this case. 
Right. 
I have a plane flight. 
Yeah, Ed was there yesterday. 
Either -- We can live with this, and they would testify if we had language similar to this. 
No, the reason why I'm asking whether it would be published, I don't know whether your original opinion -- You're worried about the precedential value. 
Hypothetically. 
That's an interesting question. 
Because I'll adopt this, but I don't want to do this again. 
Smith? 
And please summarize for us your educational background. 
I read about it in the paper. 
Neither one of them would be subject to the statement being read to them. 
-- in 2004? 
I don't remember which board meetings I attended. 
Elaborate on your objection. 
No. 
Is that a fair statement? 
No. 
No, I believe -- no, I heard about it before. 
Do you know if he has any particular expertise in Catholic theology? 
I believe Mr. 
Your Honor, my understanding in -- And -- Now, wait, Mr. 
One at a time. 
THOMPSON Whether it's "concession" or "compromise," did you hear that the teachers had agreed to put Of Pandas and People in the science classroom? 
Any redirect? 
My parents currently still live in the Dover area. 
It was prior to the June meetings because my husband was a teacher at the school, so I often heard things that he would come home and tell me. 
Please tell us what you can remember about that meeting. 
Some of the -- I attended a lot of meetings, so facts blur together. 
Comments of that nature is what he had said to her. 
I'm sorry. 
That was very distinct in my mind, just her mannerisms as she said that. 
But I had excused myself to go to the restroom just after Barrie did this whole thing. 
At that meeting. 
It is from the York Daily Record. 
And I also -- Your Honor, again, objection. 
I'm sorry. 
Let me explain how we can do this, how we must do this. 
She was the high school principal at the time. 
Essentially there were a lot of people in the community who were standing and speaking at this meeting because they wanted to warn the school board that they were not in favor of any legal action coming against the community, against the school board. 
Before we start the cross-examination, I think this will be an appropriate time for our afternoon break. 
Yes. 
Okay? 
Correct? 
Well, to my understanding, intelligent design just presupposes that everything in life is too complex, that it has to be designed. 
And you have no objection to that? 
So, I mean, as long as it has gone through that process and it's approved to be there, I don't have a problem with it being there. 
Are you aware of that? 
There were a couple instances where friends of mine had tried to check on the status of the books in the library but were not permitted to go in at that time. 
Any redirect? 
And what are those plans? 
And please tell us what you do. 
Now, did there come a time when you learned that the Dover Area School District Board of Directors was discussing or considering approval of a biology textbook? 
BY MR. 
Approximately the end of June through the present. 
I think, for the record, it's established that it's June the 14th. 
I wrote a letter to the editor -- I believe it was actually written before I attended the board meeting, but it wasn't published until after that June 14th board meeting. 
Nilsen, and I mailed a copy to Mr. 
Yes, I did. 
Okay. 
Your Honor, I would also note that it's an admission of a party opponent. 
It is for that purpose, and it's also to show that Ms. 
Is that correct? 
Our country was founded on Christian beliefs and principles. 
That is where another part of Dover's mission statement comes into play. 
You as a parent can teach your child your family's ideology." And what was your reaction to that letter when you read it in the paper, Mrs. 
That really concerned me. 
And it's your understanding that the students will not be tested on the theory of intelligent design? 
At the time it seemed that creationism and intelligent design were kind of used hand-in-hand interchangeably. 
Correct? 
May I approach this witness, Your Honor? 
He asked me if I asked for Mr. 
Yes, I was, to the best of my knowledge. 
Yeah. 
Heidi Bubb? 
And is it your understanding that those other resources included books that are actually critical of intelligent design? 
And when board members are questioned at meetings, they really don't answer any questions. 
P56 is the witness's letter to the editor. 
Not at this time, Your Honor. 
No. 
This case is about limits to an enumerated power. 
Lessig? 
We would not advance this argument, but the Government has offered an argument in a parallel case that suggests a distinction between the '76 act and this case. 
When it legislates retrospectively, it is, in effect, looking at particular authors and estates of authors who are before Congress asking for this extension, and it's choosing between these particular authors and the public at large. 
Even though Congress's pattern has been to treat all authors equally? 
So long as the grant is conditioned upon the distribution. 
Suppose it well, the Germans led the fight for 70 years in the European Union, we'll go with that, but we're going demand says,fair use. 
That's got to mean something, and if it means that we are limited in our ability to agree with the Europeans as they continually expand the term in light of their own vision of what copyright is about, then that's the meaning of a constitutional restriction. 
General Olson, we'll hear from you. 
It seems to me it's inconsistent with that. 
I have a list. 
That, I take it, is a harm. 
It's providing incentive to people to publish here, as opposed to publish in Europe, where longer terms might be available. 
It's the consistency that Congress is promoting by saying to individuals, as they might have said when they enacted the Copyright Clause in the first place, we will not only give you 14 years, but if we change our mind tomorrow, and think that a better, a longer period is necessary, we're -- this is consistency, but it's also a matter of fairness, and it's -- Why -- on the last point, it's -- I've counted that as zero. 
They didn't use that. 
They're certainly the prime actors in this scene, aren't they? 
Indeed, I wonder why that European wouldn't come anyway, even if the term were 10 years, because if he doesn't come, he's not going to get protection. 
All of these variations are quintessentially legislative judgments. 
Who is the judge of when it becomes unlimited? 
Well, the issue before this Court, I hasten to say, as I said before, is only whether, once the Congress makes that judgment, it can ever change it retrospectively. 
Yes. 
So -- But why wouldn't it? 
This is the way the State copyright laws were written when this country became a Nation. 
The other thing, as this Court has said, there is no implied abrogation of common law rights which would be a doctrine which would be inconsistent with what the petitioner is arguing. 
We have a copyright term, remember, which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that were added to the period between creation and publication, so that the limited number of years in the first, the 1790 and the 1831 statute were the number of years plus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication, so we don't have anything remotely like that in this situation. 
We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way. 
Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed. 
power. 
That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong. 
I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions. 
Here we're talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. 
We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. 
Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power. 
But you think it would not have happened -- do you think that Milosevic would not have fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? 
But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values. 
I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. 
Oh, yes. 
The mission was changed. 
I do, I do. 
I think the administration did the right thing in that case. 
I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world. 
Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. 
Where is it overextended? 
We've got to rebuild our military. 
I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal. 
I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America? 
And when it gets overextended, morale drops. 
But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. 
I just want to make sure the return is good. 
But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way. 
But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century. 
I would agree. 
I think these crimes are different. 
People are stopped, and we have to do something about that. 
K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency. 
Vice President Gore, what would be on your racial discrimination elimination list as president? 
I think we still need affirmative action. 
And they got the ultimate punishment. 
And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view. 
Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 
Well, I have no idea. 
I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. 
Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them. 
Well, I'm not for registration. 
like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles -- Excuse me, you would have to get the license -- a photo I.D. 
The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns. 
But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns. 
What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence. 
But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country. 
So it's one of my top priorities. 
I guarantee you. 
Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system. 
It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long. 
But it's not a statement about his heart. 
I would. 
on the uninsured. 
They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare. 
And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now. 
We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down. 
Let me give you an example. 
Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C. 
And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it. 
I think there's a difference. 
Now you just -- twice, sorry. 
People care about these things I've found out. 
I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen. 
That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about. 
One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make. 
Wait a minute. 
It's in your commercial. 
That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about. 
I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. 
Debate Transcript October 13, 2004 The Third Bush-Kerry Presidential Debate THIRD PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' DEBATE ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, TEMPE, ARIZONA SPEAKERS GEORGE W. 
I want to welcome you to the third and last of the 2004 debates between President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. 
Gentlemen, welcome to you both. 
I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account. 
My opponent voted against it. 
" He said, "I don't know. 
President, to you. 
And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country. 
The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly. 
Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. 
We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. 
I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks. 
He's proposed $2. 
President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States? 
And here's some help for you to go get an education. 
Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma. 
The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing. 
They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year. 
They've cut the training money. 
Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. 
I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. 
Plus, we need fiscal discipline. 
You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed. 
We have more people who qualify. 
Senator, no one's playing with your votes. 
And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live. 
I will defend the right of Roe v. 
Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. 
And so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care. 
President. 
You have, as you have proposed and as the president has commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children. 
You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits. 
In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. 
Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report. 
Not one of them are paid for. 
And we will take care of Social Security. 
Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country. 
I heard more of the same. 
And now the tax code is more fair. 
9 million new jobs over the last 13 months. 
Some see it as a human-rights issue. 
We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across. 
There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. 
The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929. 
Now that's wrong. 
Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem. 
And we'll continue to protect our borders. 
More people are dropping into poverty. 
15 an hour now for about seven years. 
If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9. 
That's not right in America. 
He'll tell you he's raised the money, and he has. 
You don't measure it by a percentage increase. 
All right, let's go to another question. 
One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it. 
Mr. 
S. 
I know something about prosecuting. 
They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47. 
If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, "Sorry, we don't have the votes," I'd have said, "Then we're going to have a fight. 
So we had a policy called "Mend it, don't end it. 
Now, let me just share something. 
President, let's go to a new question. 
And people all find their ways to express it. 
There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have. 
And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress. 
And as president, I am committed to changing that. 
Pretty divided in the 2000 election. 
I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters. 
And I think we're both very lucky. 
And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher. 
" I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America. 
Over the next four years, we'll make sure the economy continues to grow. 
That's it for us from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. 
Goodnight, everyone.

The terrorists could strike any time they choose, through any of the numerous loopholes so well reported in our media. 
All of our frantic preparations may have had some effect in preventing small-time casual attacks, but they cannot stop a serious planned attack, any more than a mere door lock can stop a serious robber who really wants to get into your house.

Although it's certainly frustrating to travel to Boston for an all-day competition on the same weekend as a good friend's birthday party, a fascinating-sounding lecture, a dance party, and seventeen other campus events no one in their right mind would ever want to miss, I agree with Carolyn. 
According to Registrar Dan Giannini, “The rationale behind such a system is to try to send the message that all courses are equal in worth and that one shouldn’t try to distinguish between courses based on time spent in or out of class.” The reason time commitment is highlighted is because, according to the authors of the article, the faculty "must consider what it can do to mitigate possible academic pressures on these students." Um. 
So we sped up, and went straight to the houses.

Erin Daly, a Widener professor who specializes in constitutional law, said that while there are questions about what counts as government promotion of religion, there is little debate over whether the First Amendment prohibits the federal government from making laws establishing religion. 
Posted by: cousinavi at October 19, 2010 5:50 PM If the laughter was with her, then the joke is on everyone there in support, of course, because moments later, after she's basically pounding the desk talking about the constitution and her unyielding devotion to that which does not separate church and state(ha-ha), she can't recall the 14th and 16th amendments and needs to be refreshed by the questioner. 
For people who speak so militantly about adhering to the constitution, I expect a military like response to such a simple question. 
Her argument dismissing the separation of church and state is dessert before dinner. 
Posted by: MrBrink at October 19, 2010 5:53 PM I have to agree with Pea and Nicole...you can clearly hear a man's voice say "Oh my god" after O'Donnell says that and his tone is "I can't believe she said something so incredibly stupid". 
To them it's not a living document that was designed to change with the nation, but essentially carved in stone like the Ten Commandments. 
O'Donnell's running on personality alone, nothing more, nothing less. 
Posted by: Lexaburn at October 19, 2010 11:24 PM Lexaburn, I have to disagree with your assessment that this is all a game and that she's not that dumb. 
In fact, I'd go a far as to say she doesn't give one damn about it. 
She's reaching for what O'Donnell has already achieved. 
Anyway, that smile she gives after asking about the 1st Amendment may very well be her being in on the joke she's making of herself. 
A reaffirmation of sorts. 
O'Donnell is opposed to anything liberal, anything progressive, anything Obama, anything Democrat, anything that can in any way be determined NOT to accord with the demands of her savior and lord jesus christ (as SHE interprets his word) in any way.

My only request of Pine from all this noise is that Pine NOT LABEL messages of Content-Type: text/plain. 
Plain text is defined differently from system to system. 
On NT, plain text is 16 bits wide (so I hear). 
It can almost replace RiceMAIL. 
So, when SMTP strips the 8th bit, it gets what it deserves. 
End of flame..............if you want a couple of tons more, read the archives of the SMTP and RFC-822 groups. 
Now PLEASE edit my address out of the headers of this. 
Initial experience with this solution has been positive. 
(4) Is it necessary to have a document identifying the language and the character sets which cater for particular language? 
Networking has had for long the problem of a common representation of computer-specific data (numbers, bit strings...) on the wire (rather, on the connection), because different computers had different conventions for them. 
Clearly, it will take much time to stand in ASCII's shoes. 
It will get void when a system will use the interchange code for itself. 
If you want to have a model for large or extendible characters, I would like to suggest that we consider (again) the model of TeX and the Computer Modern fonts. 
- Counters of levels below top-level start at the value 0 (zero) at the start tag of the next higher (parent) level. 
The relation between labels and counters is application-dependent.

How do you get these words as normal words in the text (in roman)? 
Bruce will add an SGML element to represent these. 
Dave explained that the HTML 3.0 proposal borrowed from LaTeX and TeX. 
One short term solution would be to add parameters to the math tags to specify the context in which the elements occur, e.g. 
See http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/current/phd-thesis/html/node11. 
I also see that extensible languages are hard to realize within the possibilities of the SGML language. 
I view their contributions as wholly positive. 
I think this group should make it absolutely clear that we will draw inspiration from ISO 12083 as much as we need, and that we will use the ISO TR 9573 entity sets, and also that WRI is not "running the show". 
It is just when you try to embellish an operator. 
So, this expression would result in: > {&bold {+ 2}} If each operator has a property indicating that it can act as an embellishment on other operators, then we can use this fact to make the above parse as {&bold +} 2 in preference to the interpretation of &bold as a normal prefix operator. 
Moore portrays the NRA as an unethical, dishonest organization; he sees the paranoia and fear in the United States as a primary cause of violence, and he does not see gun ownership itself as a problem. 
If violent movies and violent videogames cannot cause violence -- then how can newscasts about violence do so?" This is a faulty generalization. 
Americans cheer the killing of children, yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations. 
Critics have stated that this scene was "staged", but in the bank interview, the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time. 
It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims. 
The same goes for the interview which follows. 
Again, critics like yourself charge Moore with deception. 
While this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition, if he is unable to defend the interests of the NRA, he should not be their spokesman. 
To trash Heston, it even uses the audio/video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give, and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewer's mind to a wrong conclusion." None of this is true. 
The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics. 
The Marxists, on the contrary, argued that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity. 
The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements. 
Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739). 
The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool. 
The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2). 
Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed, often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non-governmental organizations.

These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night: the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night (Gordon, 5). 
Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest, and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance. 
void escape() { // Declare and initialize left bump sensors in // order from front to back. 
void objID() { // Declare and initialize front bump sensor. 
Younger ants work more inside the nest, and older ants work more outside the nest. 
Antie will return to the nest and // repeat this task until the temperature reaches above // 52 degrees Celsius. 
To control for this behavior, Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones. 
// Includes nest patrolling, trail patrolling and the // stimulation and thresholds to initiate and switch between // the two. 
This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds, and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest. 
if (sucpat_detect) forage_today = true; while (forage_today && temp_IP < 52) { nestExit(); trailFollow(); // Follow successful patroller trail.

The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto, focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement. 
In this particular movement, Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant, C, for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and B—this and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections. 
Example 11 illustrates this structure. 
Wilson, 174. 
In our terminology, this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant. 
Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on “a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],” Wilson, 182. 
Furthermore, this section, being the middle section of the movement, upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme. 
This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section. 
The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯. 
The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences. 
In addition to the “mode”-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes. 
Indeed, this section has the feel of a Coda to it—it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and the tonic harmony is active throughout.

Against white, one can actually establish the intensity of clashing colors; white determines the tone in the first place. 
The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set before them. 
“Pure white was de rigueur, partly because of its exciting novelty, partly because it emphasized the smoothly mechanical texture, and pointed the contrast between it and surrounding nature”(Wigley, p. 
Furthermore, with the advent of industrialization the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for all classes. 
Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of the time, where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence (Emond). 
Ulrichs claimed that the origin of such a disposition was natural and inborn (Wikholm). 
In this courageous experiment, Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men, half homosexual and half heterosexual. 
Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an illness, and their lobbying, along with the innovative study performed by Hooker, who has been referred to as “the Rosa Parks of the gay movement” convinced the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973. 
Therefore, neither homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a “choice” in the matter, and asking a homosexual “Why are you attracted to other members of your sex” is likened to asking a heterosexual “Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?” After all, why would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle? 
Both were asked how what they thought determined homosexuality (nature vs. 
Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something in the development of the embryo. 
Nonetheless, I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental causes. 
This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now, but even as I write this, new studies are being done.

Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. 
Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. 
So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight.

He has a real ear for it. 
They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary. 
I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river. 
Don’t worry, I’ll be careful not to touch it.” He thought about it, then handed me the pouch. 
It looked like a normal river stone, a gray oval with a white stripe through it. 
“Nathan,” said Nepthys, “I think that you just did something very stupid.” “I agree,” I told him. 
The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on the rosy glow around the stone, and for a moment I was blind. 
I thought back to one time when I’d been thinking about raising a family and remembered that I’d always liked the name – “Amy.” Nepthys looked at me incredulously. 
The vendor stared a little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp, but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs. 
She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure. 
Amy, still holding my hand, smiled. 
A dark glow coalesced around her palms. 
For the first time, she looked vulnerable. 
"What about Roger?" she asked, knowing that the answer no longer mattered. 
"Where I am to take you, one need never think of those left behind." They stepped together into his carriage, her eyes wide with wonder as she touched it and felt, conveyed as if through her skin, the unearthly nature of the rails and reins, the wheelspokes. 
In a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial, he refilled their glasses. 
"I had a perfect story in my pages; my hero returned home and reclaimed his love, I nearly had it tied together before…" "Before?" "Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe – though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others, thank Heaven." Arthur's face assumed a long-suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation. 
"Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy. 
Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo. 
The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree. 
"A tree? 
It speaks to the deepest storyteller's instinct within us all, yet is entirely original. 
Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead. 
Allan's thoughts fled as one, scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume. 
He watched as the carriage drew still more distant, the horses' hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway. 
In a thoughtless panic, Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre. 
The next destination was discussed: once again the Secret Service recommended against returning to Washington, and the Vice President agreed. 
At 8:30 that evening, President Bush addressed the nation from the White House. 
Beginning on September 11, Immigration and Naturalization Service agents working in cooperation with the FBI began arresting individuals for immigration violations whom they encountered while following up leads in the FBI's investigation of the 9/11 attacks. 
The U.S. 
Present were Vice President Cheney, Rice, Hadley, Powell, Armitage, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Mueller, Tenet, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and Cofer Black, chief of the DCI's Counterterrorist Center. 
In addition, Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action in Afghanistan, including the administration's first Memorandum of Notification on Bin Ladin. 
"We ask every nation to join us." President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central Command's General Franks and other advisers on September 21 and October 2. 
In Phase Two, air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al Qaeda and Taliban targets.

Thus, the President directed EPA to propose legislation that would significantly reduce SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions from power generation through a cap and trade program. 
556's short timeframes for installation of controls could lead power plants to be taken off-line at important times, which could lead to electricity shortages. 
556 does not address. 
Finally, and most importantly, the Administration strongly opposes including CO2 reductions in any multi-pollutant bill. 
The association of a monetary value with reduced emissions encourages innovation: in the 1990's, scrubber costs decreased by approximately 40% and scrubber sulfur removal efficiencies improved from 90% to 95%, and experimentation led to the blending of fuels to lower emissions. 
and trading did not result in geographic shifting of emissions, or "hot spots", as some feared. 
• SO2 and NOx contribute to acid deposition, which damages lakes and streams, adversely affecting the fish and other species that live in them, and leaches nutrients from the soil. 
But the regulation of power generators does not end with existing regulations. 
I know that many members of this Committee share that belief and are also working to develop such an approach. 
It would establish national cap-and-trade programs for NOx, SO2 and mercury emissions from power generators (with appropriate measures to address local concerns). 
Even those areas that would not be brought into attainment by these caps would need significantly fewer emission reductions to come into attainment. 
Significant reductions will go a long way towards addressing local concerns. 
Towards that end, energy diversity, the preservation of electricity generation and transmission reliability, and improvement of energy 9 efficiency/energy intensity of the electric power industry should be a key consideration. 
We believe the emission reductions and timing in the bill will be too costly for consumers and will endanger national energy security. 
It may not be efficient for EPA to make these choices in rulemaking. 
We encourage the American people to join us in making their own assessments based on the evidence gathered in our inquiry. 
Ours has been a journey of revelation. 
Yet we do not accept the view that regulators lacked the power to protect the financial system. 
Too often, they lacked the political will—in a political and ideological environment that constrained it—as well as the fortitude to critically challenge the institutions and the entire system they were entrusted to oversee. 
We conclude dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions were a key cause of this crisis. 
Within the financial system, the dangers of this debt were magnified because transparency was not required or desired. 
When the housing and mortgage markets cratered, the lack of transparency, the extraordinary debt loads, the short-term loans, and the risky assets all came home to roost. 
Time and again, from the spring of 2007 on, policy makers and regulators were caught off guard as the contagion spread, responding on an ad hoc basis with specific programs to put fingers in the dike. 
It was not until August 2008, just weeks before the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that the Treasury Department understood the full measure of the dire financial conditions of those two institutions. 
The soundness and the sustained prosperity of the financial system and our economy rely on the notions of fair dealing, responsibility, and transparency. 
One study places the losses resulting from fraud on mortgage loans made between 2005 and 2007 at $112 billion. 
Nonetheless, they sold those securities to investors. 
No one said “no.” But as a nation, we must also accept responsibility for what we permitted to occur. 
Here we render our conclusions about specific components of the system that we believe contributed significantly to the financial meltdown. 
However, it is the Commission’s conclusion that excess liquidity did not need to cause a crisis. 
Yet the government failed to ensure that the philosophy of opportunity was being matched by the practical realities on the ground.

The second section addresses the same topics in connection with Negotiated Service Agreements (NSAs), so-called "niche classifications," which are special service and rate arrangements negotiated between the Postal Service and a particular mailer or groups of mailers with features tailored to their use of the postal system. 
Section 404 of Title 39 grants the Postal Service plenary authority over custody of the mail and its movement [§ 404(a)(1)]; over the deployment of post offices, other facilities, and equipment [§ 404(a)(3)]; and over the means by which stamps and other postage are sold [§ 404(a)(4) and (5)].

The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period. 
11 Docket No. 
For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness. 
Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes.

For the most part, the book consists of a rewriting of history, from the dawn of time, with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes: the “fact” that women were responsible for all the important contributions to the advancement of civilization (as the development of agriculture, for instance), often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men; and the “fact” that women have long been subjected to domination by men.

Between 1948 and 1961, fieldworkers based at the University of Leeds conducted the Survey of English Dialects, which studied 313 localities in England (which, as everyone ought to know, does not include Wales or Scotland). 
In those countries where dialect study is undertaken, dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries: the standardization of terminology as adopted by national periodicals, news services, radio, and television; the establishment of “prestige” dialects and, through the media, their promulgation; and the huge population shifts that have taken place, particularly in the U.S. 
Such shifts have been somewhat slower in England, but seem now to be speeding up.

Zoot Suit A style of suit worn by African Americans, Filipino Americans, and Mexican Americans during the 1930s and 1940s. 
The fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs, long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads, thick-soled shoes, and long watch chains dangling from the belt. 
The possibilities are great, but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or cross-valley tilting. 
The displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated. 
For example, faults can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction. 
Water discharge determines the dimensions of the channel (width, depth, meander dimensions), but the relative proportions of bed load (sand and gravel) and suspended load (silts and clays) determine not only the shape of the channel but width–depth ratio and channel pattern. 
Alluvial rivers that transport clay, silt, sand, and gravel, can be placed within these three general categories. 
Therefore, the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common, as the nature of the sediment moved through the system changes and this may be the effect of tributary sediment contributions, or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics. 
NULL Figure 2.11 Lake Kyoga region, Uganda. 
In this very flat area the water level rises about 2 m during floods, suggesting a minimum subsidence of 4 m over about 70 years. 
The offset terraces at the mouth of the Waiohine Gorge in New Zealand shows the amount of displacement and the episodic nature of the displacement (Figure 2.12). 
Tectonic activity can significantly control river patterns and behavior, and this is especially true of alluvial rivers. 
For example, a sinuous river has a gradient less than that of the valley floor. 
If a vertical fall of baselevel from B to D and C to E is assumed, channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor. 
Another aspect of both active and neotectonics is the appearance of more resistant materials in the channel as the channel degrades. 
Yeromenko and Ivanov (1977) reviewed the Russian literature and concluded that for rivers crossing uplifts, the largest number of meanders occur upstream of the structures, which supports Gardner’s (1975) observations of bedrock channels in the Colorado Plateau.

Without employers’ orderly structures, external guides for action, and linear career paths, however, just what is the future of career? 
An enactment perspective Our exploration in this chapter is framed in the social–psychological perspective of Karl Weick (1996). 
Proponents point out that, in order to learn and solve the problems encountered in rapid technological advancement, knowledge must be shared among firms in a symbiotic balance between co-operation and competition. 
Some believe this is in part due to the location of the region, hosting a ‘West Coast’ Northern Californian alternative in geographical isolation from the established ‘East Coast’ industry. 
Others, like the late William Hewlett, a key and highly influential founder of the region, believe that success stemmed from the learning advantages of an open labour market. 
Moreover, people’s loyalty is not only to their profession, but to the host industry region. 
28). 
In the Valley, information is the life-blood of the industry and continuous learning through relationships is the key to a successful career. 
In the workers’ adopted social settings, the transition from friendly chatter to serious business occurs naturally. 
31). 
It is through such social interaction and collective action that we begin to understand how patterns and order emerge in the Valley.

Since the early 1970s, the new model has persisted. 
You’re only as good as your last job’ (pp. 
Reputation matters, as careers are self-managed and advanced through successive ‘credits’ that span multiple, largely forgotten, temporary film-making companies. 
However, it is at the level of the individual career that we can most clearly see the micro-level behaviour that fills the relatively structure-less context. 
The aggregate effects of individuals acting independently leads to macro-level cohesion. 
In the process of learning the ropes, individuals are socialised and begin to make key contacts that help progress them to the next stages of their career. 
Reciprocity A related concept is that of reciprocity. 
The simple exchange of commitment to do one’s best in return for learning opportunities may be a common one in contemporary employment, and one that inspires many workers to seek new employment pastures when their learning slows down (Arthur, Inkson & Pringle, 1999). 
New theories, such as Karl Weick’s theory on the enactment of careers, can help us to understand the underlying patterns and dynamics inherent in complex, self-organising, social phenomena.

These solutions appear mannered compared to the simple railing that I. 
That is why the architect of my house painted the radiators to resemble wood; a technologically inclined architect might have painted them silver; a minimalist would dispense with baseboards and hide the radiators in the wall. 
The conspicuous exterior dado, the baseboards, and the chair-rails in the Vanna Venturi House were hardly Classical moldings—they were merely boards with chamfered edges—yet they challenged the assumption that trim and Modernism were incompatible. 
A free-standing column à la Corbusier stands beside a chair-rail.

A report from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute classifies normal weight (without reference to age) as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9; overweight as 25 to 29.9; and obesity as 30.0 and higher [ 13 ] . 
We used linear interpolation to estimate missing data when there were known values before and after the missing value, bringing the percent complete to 95% [ 18 ] . 
YHL ranges from 0 (for persons who were never in excellent, very good, or good health) to 7 years (for persons who were healthy throughout). 
We plotted mean adjusted YOL and YHL against BMI, and tested for difference among BMI groups using confidence intervals or analysis of variance. 
White women had the most YHL and black men the fewest; black women had the most years of unhealthy life, and white men the fewest; black men lost the most years to death (1.3 out of 7) while white women lost only 0.4 years. 
Among whites, the gender differences in Table 1were statistically significant (p <.05) except for BMI and unintended weight loss. 
As mentioned above, the group with BMI from 18.5 to 20 would be considered 'normal' by the NHLBI guidelines, but had lower YOL and YHL than those with 20-24.9 in all comparisons. 
The YHL for underweight or obese women was about 4.5 years, which was significantly lower than the normal group. 
The MIRACuLous The efficacy and safety findings from MIRACL were unique for a number of reasons. 
Unfortunately, no late clinical follow up is planned. 
NTPDases do not form phosphorylated intermediates during catalysis, a conclusion also supported by lack of vanadate sensitivity and Pi product inhibition [ 3 4 5 6 ] . 
The intensity of species D1 accounted for 11.4% of species T from bound VO 2+-AMPPNP, and the intensity of D2 accounted for 7.1% of species T. 
The intensity ratio of D1 over D2 increased about 75 fold to become 120. 
In order to further assign species D1 and D2 to the two different conformations, two experiments were done (Fig. 
Only species D2 was observed and its intensity decreased as the incubation time was prolonged. 
Free VO 2+binds to sCD39 through two hydroxyl groups and two water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other residues of sCD39. 
Dissolved molecular oxygen was removed from solutions by purging with dry nitrogen gas. 
To define additional sites of expression outside of the CNS, we analyzed the distribution of Gad1 transcripts in E8.5 to E14.5 mouse embryos by whole mount in situ hybridization. 
Examination of sections from an E9.5 embryo revealed a high level of Gad1 expression throughout the mesenchyme and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of the tailbud (figure 1F). 
A dynamic pattern of Gad1 expression was detected in the developing vibrissae from E12.5 to E14.5 (figure 4A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H). 
The data demonstrate that Gad1 is expressed in several sites outside of the developing CNS and in derivatives of all three germ layers. 
The localized and dynamic expression pattern of Gad1 suggests a wider role for GAD and GABA in the development of non-neural tissues than was previously known. 
Therefore, in 60% of the patients with sub clinical or clinical evidence of liver disease, no clear explanation for the abnormal LFTs was found, except for the association with 1°SS. 
None of the patients with abnormal liver function tests had clinical evidence of muscle involvement that could explain the high levels of amino-transferases. 
Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) were sought in 5 patients, with positive ASMA in 2. 
Those patients with serological evidence of systemic inflammation, as shown by an elevated sedimentation rate, were more likely to have liver test abnormalities. 
With etiopathogenesis of 1°SS still an open question [ 34 ] , a possible role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has drawn attention. 
Although no other diagnosis explaining liver disease may be found, the disorders for which treatment might be beneficial (e.g. 
North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications produced annually. 
More relevant measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research and development (May 1997). 
Although there are outstanding scientific researchers in the developing world who independently are making important contributions to the international scientific community, they are the exception. 
To develop effective health policies, one must understand the existing health risks and disease burdens. 
To compare different risks or burdens, they calculate disability-adjusted life-years, or DALYs—the number of healthy life years lost because of a particular disease or risk factor. 
Conversely, prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) decreases smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen synthesis [ 17 18 ] . 
After transfer, the filters were incubated overnight at 4°C in a blocking solution (20 mM TRIS base, 137 mM sodium chloride at pH 7.6, 5% powdered milk, 3% BSA), and incubated with primary polyclonal rabbit antibodies against COX-2 at a dilution 1:1000 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), for 1 hour at room temperature. 
Results of PGE 2 production were similar when experiments were conducted in serum free media conditions (results not shown). 
It is very likely that a complex interaction among these factors exists in the tissue repair process, and it is possible that pathologic fibrosis, as in IPF, results from phenotypical alterations in fibroblasts that affect the "normal" interaction of these factors. 
TXA 2 production tended to be greater in IPF than in normal fibroblasts at baseline; when stimulated with IL-1β this difference became statistically significant. 
Hence, the pathway involved in the induction of the COX-2 gene by IL-1β and TGFβ may be different. 
The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area remained popular with early travelers. 
The island communities were undecided about which side to back for a time. 
Hellenistic and Roman Periods When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east as India, the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes. 
By the time of the Crusades, many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated. 
Greece moved in to administer the land, but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part of greater Greece. 
Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty and terror, and many made new homes in the United States and Australia. 
In 1982, Greece joined the European Common Market (now the European Union).
