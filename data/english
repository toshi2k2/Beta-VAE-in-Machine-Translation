A German folk tale
Behold!
The portals of darkness are open, and the shadows of the dead hunt over the Earth...
"Back!
Hold! Why dost thou scourge mankind with War, Plague, Famine?
!"
"The Earth is mine!"
"Never will the Earth be thine:
Man belongs to God!"
"Look below!"
"All things in heaven and on Earth are wonderful!
But the greatest wonder is man's freedom to choose between good and evil!"
"Dost thou know Faust?"
"A knave like all others!
He preaches good and does evil!
He seeks to turn base metal into gold!
Behold his greed!"
"A wager:
I will wrest Faust's soul away from God!"
"If thou canst destroy what is divine in Faust, the Earth is thine!"
"No man can resist evil!
The bet is on!"
"The Plague!
The Plague!"
The devastating pestilence raged:
in a few days half the town lay dying.
To find a cure for the Plague, Faust spent day and night in prayer with God.
And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without its dead. "Lord God, bless this act of redemption!
Only you can alleviate our misery!"
"Help... help!
My mother is dying!"
Mortal terror and fear of death swept through the town.
"Repent, fast, pray!
Only Faith can vanquish death!"
"Have respect for the dead!"
"We still live, we still love! We shall die dancing in each other's arms!"
"Who has faith shall live!
But death will take the sinners!"
"The Plague!
The Plague!"
"Compassion, Faust!
Only you can help us!"
"Get hence!
We are lost!
No faith is any help.
No knowledge is any help.
All is vanity... "
Mine God, thou art merciful and a great goodness.
The third great Key to the Force of the Ghost of Hell.
And if thou would summon the Prince of Darkness to aid thee and give thee all the might and glory of the world, go to a crossroad and call on him three times.
"I invoke thy aid, Spirit of Darkness: show thyself!"
"Come forth, demon of evil!"
"As thou art called with thy unholy name:
MEPHISTO appear!"
"You have summoned me!"
"Here I am!"
I renounce God and his heavenly legion, and so shall be mine the power and glory of the world.
"Be gone from me, Satan!"
"To have the power to help for only one day!"
"One day!
Try it! Just one trial day!"
"When the hour-glass has run out... "
"... you go free, the Pact canceled!
Sign!"
glory... power
"Can you help the hungry and the sick?"
"What you wish I will perform: you are the master and I am your servant. "
"A drop of blood!"
"Blood is quite a remarkable substance!"
"Only for one day?"
"Until the sand has run out!"
"Faust!
Help us!"
"Then I shall help in the devil's name!"
"A miracle!
A miracle!"
"In the name of Christ crucified, help my child!"
"He cannot look upon the Holy Cross!"
"He is in league with the devil!
Stone him!
Stone him!"
"Deliver me, elixir of death!"
"You may not cheat me!
Remember our pact: the trial day is not over yet. "
"Death sets all men free!"
"Is that death?"
"It is life, Faust, seducing you with the fair image of your youth. "
"Wretched Faust, why do you seek death?
You have not yet lived!"
"I despise my life!"
"Your life was only the dust and mold of books!
Pleasure is all!"
"I am too old!"
"I offer you the greateast happiness: youth!
Seize it!"
"Give me youth!"
"I've caught you, old boy!"
"Take me to her!"
"Step upon my cloak... "
"... and the spinning Earth will spread before you!"
"The wedding feast for the Duchess of Parma, the most beautiful woman in Italy!"
"Strange guests!"
"To pay tribute to the highest beauty, my lord brings you his kingdom's treasures!"
"The day is over!
The sand has run out!
Be as you were!"
"Youth...
Leave me youth!"
"Our pact stands for eternity?"
"You have tasted all of life's pleasures, Faust!
From indulgence to indulgence, sensation without end, yet nothing satisfied you!"
"What will you: a woman, a game of chance, an orgy?
Whatever you wish, I must grant!"
"Do you want the Emperor's crown?"
"Home!"
"Take me home! And at once!"
"Is today a feast day in your town?"
"Are you heathen born that you have never heard of Holy Easter?"
"It is as if life had stood still:
All is as it once was!"
"An innocent little girl, running to a priest... she is not for you!"
"Tedeum laudamus Praise the Lord. "
"Vacation, mother!"
"I know more obliging wenches. for you here!"
"I want only her.
Do as I command!"
"Brother Valentin!"
"Once she has this little golden chain in the house she will begin to feel the devil's power!"
"Good gracious, how pretty you are!"
"Any lovers yet?"
"What have you, child?"
"Tell the mother of God, if you cannot tell me!"
"May I visit Aunt Marthe?"
Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein
"Three little drops from this love potion by night and all the girls' hearts will be yours!"
"Look Aunt Marthe what I found in my drawer... "
"A rich treasure!"
"I found it in my jewelry box!"
"Just once let me try on the beautiful necklace!"
"A small bouquet for the bridegroom, a little wreath for the bride!"
"Pardon, lovely lady. I seek Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein!"
"From your cousin... from Lombardy...!"
"He gave me this necklace as a gift for you!"
"Those we encircle within this ring shall be sweethearts...!"
"One, two, three. Makes you free!"
"Pardon: my stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink!"
"Permit, that I mix myself a litle drink as I learned it in Padua!"
"My friend, a prince of the noblest blood!"
"He loves me loves me not loves me... "
"Yes, with all his heart he loves you!"
"She loves me... "
"She loves me not. "
"She loves you!"
"I am yours forever!"
"He loves me!"
"What are you waiting for?
Your sweetheart herself lights the way for you!"
"Cursed matchmaker!"
"I will keep the brother out of the way!"
"To the prettiest girl in town!"
"No other girl is as pretty as your sister:
long live Gretchen!"
"A pretty girl is not pure!"
"Here's to Gretchen!"
"Here's to your Gretchen!"
"If you hurry you can catch her lover before he slips out of her room. "
"Flee! ... Flee!
"Murder!"
"Murder... murder!"
"Murder...
Murder...
Murder!"
"Flee! ... Flee!
"Touch me not, you wanton, your lover has slain me!"
"First read a requiem. Mass for me!
Then to the stocks with this harlot!"
"Gretchen...
Gretchen!"
"Now death and nature with surprise Behold the trembling sinners rise To meet the Judge's searching eyes. "
"For now before the Judge severe No crime can pass unpunished here. "
"All hidden things must plain appear. "
"Mother!
Mother!"
"And has born a little child in the depth of winter. "
"Have mercy on my child!"
"Are you not Gretchen, who stood in the stocks?"
"Mercy! Mercy!
My child is dying!"
"She has killed her child!
Seize her, the murderess!"
"Faust...
Faust... help your Gretchen!"
"Mephisto!"
"You have betrayed me!
She suffers!
She suffers!"
"To the stake with the child murderer!"
"Save her, save Gretchen!"
"Too late!
Even now they build her funeral pyre!"
"You are still my servant!
Bring me to her, or the pact is broken!"
"My steed awaits!
Quick, before morning comes!"
"Faster!
Faster!"
"Oh had I never wished for youth, that brought this misery!
Curse... curse the delusion of youth!"
"You have yourself cursed youth!
What you wish I must grant!"
"Be as you were: an old man!"
"Forgive... forgive me my sin!"
"Gretchen!"
"Here is no place for thee!"
"I claim my wager!"
"One Word breaks thy pact!"
"Tell me the Word!"
"The Word that wings joyfully throughout the universe, The Word that appeases every pain and grief, The Word that expiates all human guilt, the Eternal Word... dost thou not know it?"
"Tel me the Word!"
Love
THE DEVIL'S ENVOYS
...and so, in the lovely month of May, 1485, the Devil sent two of his envoys to this world to drive humans to despair...
There it is.
Tell me, my good man.
Would the lord of this castle welcome two minstrels who've traveled far to entertain him?
- I believe so. You're in luck.
Baron Hugues loves music and soon Miss Anne will be wed to Sir Renaud.
Since the engagement, it's been banquet after banquet.
In festive times, my skills aren't needed, so I fish to pass the time.
Thank you, good man.
No, let me thank you for calling me "good man"!
In spite of everything, it's nice to hear!
Come to me, pretty frogs!
Make up your minds!
Afraid of the executioner?
Then come to the "good man"!
My lords!
Kind lords!
How heavy is my heart!
A beast who never hurt anyone, a beast who made the whole castle laugh!
He was just crossing the courtyard and the guards shot him, just for sport.
This is all I have left!
He's dead, kind lords.
He was my brother!
What will I do?
Woe is me!
- Why bother, Gilles?
- I enjoy doing good sometimes.
Why bother?
These performers are putting me to sleep.
Let's hope this one is more entertaining.
You're hard to please. I found the juggler quite amusing.
He has a sad face.
Father, isn't his face sad?
- Shall I throw him out?
- I don't wish to cause him harm.
It'd be a shame to lose such a face.
I agree! His hollow cheeks make me hungry!
Stand up. Show us what you can do.
Nothing myself, noble lord, but I can display three extremely rare creatures.
Few have ever seen them.
Commoners are naive and easily frightened.
Only the great can properly appreciate these oddities of nature.
You're too sensitive, Anne. Take a look.
I assure you, they're very funny.
I don't want to.
Look, just to make me happy.
Then look back at me. You'll only love me more.
I don't want to see them. I feel sorry for them.
Take them away.
I don't want you to be sad, dear child.
These banquets are to make you happy.
Think you're pretty enough to mock them?
I'm no beauty, but compared to them, I must seem pretty!
I believe my daughter would like to hear sweet things that touch the heart.
Stories of romance, the yearnings of simple hearts.
Are there any singers in the hall?
Demons and marvels
Winds and waves
Far away already
And you Like seaweed Caressed by the wind
In the dunes of your bed
You stir in your sleep
Demons and marvels
Winds and waves
Far away already
But in your half-open eyes
Two little waves
Demons and marvels
Winds and waves
Two little waves
To drown myself in
You sing well, young man. Who are you?
My name is Gilles.
This is my brother, Dominique.
Sing us another song.
The tender and dangerous face of love
Appeared to me one night after an endless day
Perhaps it was an archer with his bow
Perhaps a musician with his harp
I know no more
I know nothing
All I know Is that he wounded me
Perhaps with an arrow
Perhaps with a song
All I know
Is that he wounded me
His shot hit my heart wounded forever
Burning Ardently burning
Love, always love! With its little sighs and big deceits!
Before, at least we had songs about war, hunting, the urge to fight, to kill.
You're too harsh, Renaud.
I might not have loved Baroness Berthe like in the songs, but she meant so much to me.
So much.
But my wife is dead and times have changed.
Now everyone speaks of love. Too much!
I don't like it.
You look proud of yourself.
How dare you gaze into a lady's eyes while crooning such nonsense?
Renaud, please!
If I had you hung, would you sing as sweetly with a rope around your throat?
I doubt it.
Then sing no more if you value the pitiful thing you call your life!
Your mind is elsewhere, Anne.
Are you sad because of how I spoke of love?
No, dear friend.
I'm not angry with you.
You know, I also used to dance when Berthe was still alive.
My creatures are tired. Where may they sleep?
I'll show you the room reserved for the performers.
- What are you thinking of?
- Nothing.
Then who are you thinking of?
Did I ever give you reason for jealousy? Fortunately, no.
I simply wish to remind you that soon you will be mine.
Did you hear me?
- Yes, Renaud.
Your every pleasure, desire, even sorrow, if you have any, should be given to me.
May I at least dream?
As little as possible!
Dreams are dangerous and useless.
I never dream myself.
As soon as I saw you, I knew why I'd traveled so far.
I thanked Heaven for leading me to you.
As soon as I saw you, I knew you'd come for me.
I knew it. I'm sure my life will change.
Do you regret it?
No.
Will you regret it?
Never.
Even if it makes me suffer.
Those who love never suffer.
Look at them.
Do they suffer?
No.
They feel marvelously alone, the moonlight shines on their love.
And those two star-gazers, what are they thinking of?
Nothing.
Not even the stars.
They are together, in love.
They are happy.
And that solitary man. So sad, so hopeless.
Surely his beloved has left him, or he her, and so the moon, the stars, the birds, the very trees of this garden no longer exist for him.
He hears nothing, he sees nothing.
He's all alone.
His love is gone.
If you ever left me,
I'd be in despair, like him.
My page Guillaume, with Agnès?
I didn't know they were in love.
They're not.
For them, it's a game.
They toy with love.
That's the one who truly loves Guillaume.
Louison?
She hides and watches them.
She wants to cry.
She's ugly, no one loves her.
If she loves him, why is she ugly?
It's not fair. It makes me sad, too.
I don't want you to be sad tonight.
She's so pretty now!
It's nothing.
The devilish beauty of youth.
I don't believe in the Devil!
You're lucky.
My name is Anne.
Anne... you're the most marvelous creature I ever met.
I'm so happy.
I'll never forget you.
If this is just a dream, I hope I never wake up.
Why do you laugh?
Isn't it funny?
You just met me, and already, you say you love me.
Time is unimportant.
I love you.
That's just how it is.
How can I believe that?
Before, you had nothing but scorn for love.
"Before" is already far away.
Now you're near me.
That's what matters.
I must be dreaming!
Where did you come from?
Who are you?
Who am I?
You just said it. A woman who's near you, in your arms.
Come, Anne.
Renaud? With another woman?
As soon as I saw you, I knew why I'd traveled so far.
I thanked Heaven for leading me to you.
Alas, I must leave soon.
I don't want you to leave.
Take this ring.
If we're ever apart, it will remind you of me.
Your mind is elsewhere.
Your thoughts also seem far away.
Who gave you that chain?
Who gave you that ring?
You're in a pitiful state.
Gilles and Dominique Dominique and Gilles The Devil treats his children well
If they obey him well Remember Remember
What's written is written!
You signed a pact with him!
Gilles and Dominique Dominique and Gilles Who pretend to love
Remember
You must continue It's your destiny: Seduction, Corruption, Villainy
Monsters.
Always monsters.
We won't sleep tonight.
Did you want to?
- Don't laugh.
- Why not?
If I find it amusing, what's wrong with that?
You haven't given me much reason to laugh since we've lived together.
Be quiet!
Why stir up long-dead things?
Who killed them?
Did I?
Did you?
Or both?
Who nipped in the bud Our story of love?
Enough!
You know we never really loved each other.
We'd known too many before we met, played at love too many times.
- Be quiet! Why?
Feeling remorseful?
Remorse!
Too bad.
I've heard it helps pass the time.
If I felt remorse, it might help, wouldn't it?
But why would I?
Men have loved me, as they like to whisper in my ear.
I let them.
Is it my fault if they wept, gave everything for me, even their lives?
The young men were passionate, the old men crawled at my feet.
When did I ever cry or throw myself at your feet?
You're different.
Greedy, stubborn, proud.
You just want to be loved, to take without giving, to keep it all and leave.
Like you!
You hunted me like a cat hunts a mouse.
But we're both cats, there is no mouse.
It's not our fault.
We both thought we'd caught a tender new victim.
Two executioners, face to face and no one to torture!
How sad!
- Enough!
If you'd truly loved me, I might have loved you.
If you'd truly loved me, I, too, might have loved you.
Go on.
Scare me. Hit me. Kill me.
My handsome love.
What's the point?
What is signed, is signed.
Aren't we happy?
Others love us, they suffer for us.
We watch them and we go away.
A lovely trip and the Devil picks up the bill.
Good night, Gilles.
Want to know where I'm going?
I already know.
Where will you spend the night?
Obviously!
It'd be a shame to disturb her dreams.
Such tender creatures should be wooed in daylight.
Baron Hugues!
What do you want at this hour, young man?
How dare you knock at my door?
I don't know, a sudden impulse.
Don't be angry, even if you can't understand.
I'm in grave danger.
I feel so alone, so helpless.
Touch my heart. Feel how it pounds!
Alas, it's true, I belong to the weaker sex.
So weak!
You alone know my secret.
As soon as I saw you, I knew why I'd traveled so far. I thanked Heaven for leading me to you.
Who are you?
Where did you come from?
I abandoned everything to escape a terrible fate, but I'm still so troubled.
I need help and advice.
How can I help you when I myself live in the past, in my memories?
It's not good to live in the past.
I try to forget everything.
Alas, my brother is only my brother and I am so alone.
So am I, child.
When my wife died, I lost my desire to live.
How you must have loved her!
Yes. We loved each other.
Love is a beautiful thing.
It was long ago.
I'm old now. Don't say that.
If one is young at heart, that's true youth.
She's in her bed
She sleeps and dreams she is yours
You must make her wait
The more she waits The more she'll love you
The more she loves you The more she'll suffer!
What is your desire, now that I've confided i n you?
What is my desire?
Why ask such a question?
What do I desire?
I desire you, totally, completely, and you know it!
You're so blunt.
Sorry to offend. Perhaps it's no way to woo women, but I speak my mind.
I said you were blunt, not that I didn't like it.
Too many who call themselves men tremble and sigh for their sweethearts.
And you said you don't know how to talk to women!
The way you talk, who'd believe your wedding is so near?
Leave the wedding out of it.
It's cruel of you to remind me.
Is it true that traditionally, the newlyweds' chamber is prepared and left open well in advance of the wedding?
Yes, that's our custom.
A lovely tradition.
I'd love to see the chamber.
How commendable, this bedroom awaiting a young couple destined for each other.
Be quiet.
Everything about it expresses peace and happiness.
Peace... happiness.
Since I met you, they don't matter. Peace and happiness no longer matter to me.
It's a shame to rise so early when we're so happy in bed!
Alone in bed, how can I be happy?
Why alone?
The castle's full of pretty girls. Take a look.
And my heart is yours
Will we have the pleasure of Anne's company?
I doubt it. My daughter doesn't enjoy hunting.
You seem troubled.
Did you sleep well? It's been years since that happened.
What a shame, for isn't night made for sleeping?
Did you sleep well, my lady?
I had a marvelous night.
Why so gloomy?
It's a joyous day. Why not invite those two minstrels whose songs you so appreciated?
You didn't seem to appreciate them last night.
I can admit when I'm wrong.
Agnès!
How kind of you to join us!
It's a lovely surprise. Should not all your pleasures become mine?
I hope you also know hunting songs.
That minstrel has a peculiar voice, doesn't he?
Hunting is so sad.
I love birds!
Don't worry. No bird shall be caught.
I promise. The birds are my friends, too.
It's strange, you show no fear or surprise at things that surprise others, that frighten them.
Why be frightened?
Life is full of mysteries, isn't it?
A bird, an apple, a beast, the sun, the trees in these woods...
Even us: we don't know from whence we come or where we go.
The water is so sweet.
Your lips are sweet, too.
I love you, Anne.
Gilles!
What's wrong? I don't know.
I was so happy, then suddenly, I thought of Renaud.
He also said, "I love you, Anne."
But with the same hard voice in which he says:
"I love my dogs.
I love hunting.
I love killing whatever flies or leaps." "I love you, Anne. You'll be mine forever."
Forever.
Is it possible for a person to totally belong to another?
Some call that love.
Then is love like death?
We no longer exist? It's all over?
Why?
If you love me, don't hurt me, don't lock me up, let me live!
It's impossible!
What would your daughter say? And Renaud? Nothing.
It is not their place to speak.
I want – Do you hear me?
I want you to take off these men's clothes.
- Right now?
- What are you saying? Nothing.
You speak, I remain silent.
Don't laugh. I want them to bow to you in awe of your beauty when they see you in a dress.
See me in a dress?
Is that all you desire?
Why tempt a man whose life is over?
Do you cling, like ivy, to your memories?
I implore you...
How can you be so unfeeling?
Me?
Make you unhappy?
Since you're here, I feel 20 years younger.
I'm a different man.
Why do you blame me?
I blame you for nothing, dear child.
I'd lost my quarry, so I was looking for you.
Like you, undoubtedly.
Obviously, you wouldn't understand, but...
Dominique, here with us, is a woman.
Truly?
Truly.
She's in grave danger. She requested my protection.
Only you and I know her secret.
Truly?
Truly.
I hear our friends.
We'd better join them.
What game are you playing?
What do you mean?
He kneeled, he kissed your hands.
Don't I deserve homage?
Women like to please.
Dominique! I'm only teasing.
The baron was suspicious.
He questioned me and I answered.
- That's all.
- That's all?
Are you jealous of an old man?
Me, jealous?
Now do you believe that a person can totally belong to another... - Gilles. - ...without being unhappy?
I'm happy.
And you?
Me?
Why would I be happy?
Because I'm here with you?
Because I held you in my arms?
To me, that's happiness.
Happiness!
How boring!
It's incredible, the only thought in such a pretty head, always the same thought:
Happiness!
It's all so terribly absurd, tragic, monotonous and banal!
What "Gilles"?
What do you want from "Gilles"?
What does "Gilles" mean?
Maybe my name isn't even Gilles!
I beseech you... don't laugh that way!
Such a sad laugh!
Would you rather I burst into tears or roll at your feet because you love me?
I love you and I know you love me too.
Listen carefully.
Anne, my friend,
I don't love you.
Be quiet. It's not true!
You don't know what you're saying!
Please don't look at me that way.
Is it my fault if I've never loved?
- Be quiet.
- Hush!
It isn't worth a single tear, it's nothing but a story invented to amuse the Devil.
Believe me, no one loves anyone.
Everyone pretends! They stalk their prey, set traps.
And happiness – since you believe it exists – might be, especially for you, to avoid those traps.
You're leaving?
Yes.
If you knew how much I love you, you'd have no choice but to love me.
I now reveal this secret, which previously, only Renaud and I knew.
A woman? Remember, Baron? I noticed this minstrel's "peculiar" voice.
They aren't minstrels.
They are of noble birth and deserve to be honored.
They'll dine at my table, and at the tournament, I'll wear their colors!
- Well said!
- Yes, truly.
Curious story, isn't it?
Were you aware of it?
- No. The young man didn't tell you this afternoon in the woods?
Did the young lady tell you last night in the garden?
During their stay, it is your duty to amuse them.
An easy task, for they seem well-equipped to amuse us.
Why are you so ill-humored?
Why have you suddenly recovered your desire to live?
Is it possible that Dominique is truly your sister?
Such an innocent question...
Answer me.
If Dominique were my sister, do you think I'd squander my time and pleasure to travel with her?
You love her?
To speak truly, she is my only love.
Why take such pleasure in seeing me suffer?
Why?
I knew you loved me!
Alas!
We are under a spell and once it dissipates, you'll see me as I truly am, miserable and alone.
I love you!
I belong to the Devil.
I'm among his friends.
If you love me, it's probably thanks to him.
Why torture yourself like that?
I believed myself utterly alone, yet since I've found you, I'm even more lost, more alone, more desperate.
To me, you are all the love in the world and all I can bring you is sorrow and despair.
Hold me in your arms.
Once more, tell me you love me.
You are so simple, so young, so sweet and so alive!
Protect me.
Teach me to live.
Before I met you, I only pretended.
My heart was like ice.
My love, be happy and at peace.
My body is close to yours, your heart beats with mine, our bodies, our hearts are one.
Nothing can ever separate us!
I love you. And no one – Do you hear?
No one can stop me from loving you!
What strange weather!
It's true!
You should've moved your knight!
Too late.
I've made my move.
What is it?
A lord caught in the storm requests hospitality for the night.
Excuse me, I must welcome this unexpected guest.
I'm honored to welcome you to my home.
Thank you.
- You come from afar?
- Very far!
I'm quite a traveler!
The storm caught me by surprise.
I don't fear lightning, but getting soaked to the skin is terribly unpleasant.
Such a lovely fire!
I like fire.
It likes me too.
The flames are so attentive.
They lap at my fingers like a hound.
A pleasant sensation!
Forgive me for not introducing myself, although, coming from afar, my name and title mean little to you.
Forgotten in my homeland, unknown abroad, such is the traveler's fate!
But I'm delighted to find myself in such gallant company!
- I hope you'll join us for dinner?
- With pleasure!
Did I interrupt your game?
No matter. I'd lost from the start.
You think so?
Checkmate.
You win.
Chess is so simple!
I didn't know your daughter will soon be wed!
Forgive me for intruding on this family occasion!
I hope your fiancé isn't vexed by my ill-timed visit.
Dominique is not my fiancé.
No?
You'd make a lovely couple.
Don't you agree?
You look astonishingly like one of my daughters.
I'm flattered.
- You have daughters?
- Yes!
I have many children, boys and girls, but I must admit, I prefer girls, especially ones like you.
I prefer girls.
Boys are ungrateful. No sense of duty, disobedient.
I'm not a hard man, but I detest... I detest being disobeyed!
We all have our foibles, don't we?
Tell me, Baron, where is your daughter?
Shall we see her tonight? I doubt it.
She's already retired. A slight illness.
I think it's a caprice.
Already?
It's tragic to leave her all alone in her room with her "caprice."
What a shame! I'd have loved to meet her.
Since you resemble my daughter, would you intervene in favor of someone fetching the sweet bride-to-be?
Please, Baron? It'd make me so happy.
What wouldn't I do to make you happy?
Come, Renaud.
You'll talk to her.
Why do you laugh?
Why?
How curious!
You laugh, yet don't know why!
Perhaps you laughed simply because it's good to laugh once in a while.
Surely you laughed because you sensed something will happen that's absolutely tragic!
Alas, even the best of us rejoice in the troubles of others!
It's only human.
But you wouldn't have dared to laugh if I hadn't laughed first.
Don't be surprised by my clairvoyance!
I only use my talents for the good of all.
There's no need to peek through keyholes to know what happens in ladies' chambers and men's hearts! A lady is to wed a young man, but she loves another.
A banal story!
He joins her in her room, but he gets caught!
How sad.
If they are caught together, what happens?
Her lover is beaten, arrested by the guards!
They drag him to the stairs. He stumbles, then gets up, only to fall under more blows!
This man has odiously abused my hospitality. He will be punished.
- You summoned me?
- This man is a dog!
Treat him as such! So be it.
Chain him up with the other dogs!
Not a bad start!
How can I ever forgive you for this?
And you, sire, do you hold the sister responsible for her brother's crimes?
My heart is in shreds.
Your suffering pains me.
Forgive me, we've just met, but it's sad to see you in such a state.
Let's stroll in the garden.
The fresh air will do you good.
I don't know why, but that man scares me.
I'm glad you don't blame this young woman for her brother's unfortunate conduct.
It's the mark of a generous soul and a chivalrous heart.
She's so fortunate to have found here all the affection she deserves.
- We care for her a lot. - Quite right!
She merits every respect.
And why not love?
What a pretty ring!
May I?
I adore jewelry.
Marvelous craftsmanship.
Judge for yourself.
This initial, this D!
It's so finely engraved, this D!
Who are you?
How did you get in?
I'm the Devil!
I could care less.
What?
Don't you understand?
I'm the Devil!
Yes, the Devil. How else can I be here and elsewhere at once?
Yes, elsewhere.
For example, in the garden.
If Dominique loves me, what can you do about it?
Absolutely nothing!
Please, there's no need for violence!
What's so marvelous about that?
I'm here, locked in my room, but am I not also at the fountain where my beloved held me in his arms?
You speak like a child, for you don't know my power.
Just watch.
- You're jealous, that's all!
- Me?
It's written all over your face.
"Dominique, what wouldn't I do to make you happy? "
You cling to her skirts, cater to her whims.
You smile like a kind father, but your eyes betray your desire!
Wretch!
What's wretched and laughable is an old man begging for love!
You shouldn't have done that.
Gentlemen!
Surely you won't kill each other in the garden, under your daughter's window?
You're right.
- Tomorrow we shall duel as knights.
- To the death!
Excellent idea!
If something terrible should happen, everyone will consider it an unfortunate accident.
- It's awful!
- Not at all!
Nothing will befall your father. I'll watch over him.
Leave me alone.
I'm not listening. For me, you don't exist.
Maybe not for you, but for others...
Gilles, for example.
Poor, miserable Gilles.
Be quiet.
Gilles is no longer miserable.
He'll never be miserable because we love each other.
Rejoice, Gilles! It seems you're miserable no more!
Here you are, chained up like a dog, waiting for the executioner to rip out your nails, gorge you with water, sew your eyelids shut, break a few bones!
Naturally, none of this will trouble your happiness, the glorious happiness of love.
It's true. I'm happy.
Poor fool! You won't get away with it.
That'd be too easy!
If you possess someone even once, they belong to me forever!
Do what you will with me, but Anne belongs to no one.
She is free.
You have no power over her.
You think she's all yours?
For always?
Poor Gilles, look what you're reduced to!
A brilliant boy like you, caught in the pitiful traps of love.
You should know better.
Want an example?
This place is full of them.
Listen, instead.
Can't you hear the Baron tiptoeing through the castle?
Excuse me, I was simply passing by.
Returning to my room after a moonlight stroll.
Lovely night, isn't it?
I couldn't sleep.
So I got up and went for a walk.
I understand completely.
I sleep like a baby, so I pity those who don't.
Excuse me, Baron, but I'm exhausted.
Good night.
I'm grateful you didn't hide this from me, but now I'm frantic with worry.
I'm afraid to lose you.
Death in a duel is simple and swift, with barely time to suffer and none to think.
I admire how you speak of death so lightly!
I'm not talking of my own death.
Since I met you, I'm filled with a ferocious lust for life.
A life with you.
With me, close to me.
In your arms, forever.
When the Baron struck me, I lost all respect for him.
Tomorrow, after the duel, we'll run away together.
Truly?
You'd abandon everything for me?
Once the Baron is dead, do you think I'd stay here with Anne and your brother's lovesick wailing under our window each night?
Please, don't talk about poor Gilles! I'm already so afraid... for your life.
Have no fear.
Look how fine the links are in this Italian chain mail!
Here we can't make them this pretty or this strong.
With this and a bit of luck, even the worst blows can't harm me.
A fine proof of love, if you're in no danger!
Don't you see?
It's only to reassure you. I'd fight bare-chested if you wished it.
I fear no man, nor the Devil, nor death!
"Nor the Devil, nor death."
You please me well, Renaud. So confident, so dangerous!
Tomorrow, wear this under your doublet.
You'll remember the warmth of my body as you fight to keep me.
Anne, my love, my true love!
Anne, you are as beautiful as the day!
I love you madly!
Give me your lips!
Leave me alone.
You aren't Gilles.
- What? You aren't Gilles.
You look like Gilles, you have his voice, but Gilles would never say such things.
If you say so. Then who am I?
It's easy to guess.
You're the one who came yesterday.
You called yourself the Devil, the Demon, the Deceiver.
Since you can't be fooled...
It's true, you are the Deceiver.
You may even deceive yourself. There are some things that escape you.
Escape me?
Poor idiot! Nothing escapes me.
No one can escape me, not even you!
You don't know my powers!
I hold the world in my hands!
That's right! Storms, rain, hail, wind, shipwrecks: that's me!
Sickness, war and all its pleasures, pestilence, famine, misery, murder, hatred, jealousy.
That's me, always me!
And death.
Me, again!
With such an existence, I can see why you're not happy!
Me, not happy?
I'm so easily amused!
I find the troubles of this world most entertaining.
They warm my heart, make me laugh.
Yes, they make me laugh. But I hate laughing by myself.
Do you hear me?
Why don't you answer?
What are you thinking of, wretch?
A song my governess once sang, she said it was the fairies –
I detest fairies!
I detest stories like that!
When the two lovers' hearts Beat as one
Enough!
If you ever sing that again, I'll turn you to stone!
Even if you turned me into a hag, or a dead serpent, it wouldn't matter to me because my love would still live.
"Her love." She dares mention her love!
Don't forget, treacherous creature, that you've done wrong. You've sinned. If it's a sin to give myself to the one I love,
I don't regret it.
Truly?
You should be ashamed!
Ashamed?
Why?
I don't even know what shame is!
Shame... is what we hide.
If you're not ashamed of your love, why not shout it from the rooftops?
Why not tell the whole town?
Why not?
Listen!
I've been locked in this room to keep me from the one I love.
I've no wish to wound anyone, but I love Gilles.
Not only do I love him, I have but one desire: to be near him, to share his fate, for better or for worse.
"For worse."
You can count on that, dear girl.
The sin of scandal is the greatest sin.
Your poor daughter must be possessed by a demon!
Poor Anne.
It breaks my heart to treat her like this, but as the shame was public, so must be the punishment.
Sad lost children We wander through the night
Where are day's blooms?
Love's pleasures?
Life's radiance?
Sad lost children We wander through the night
The Devil treacherously whisks us away
The Devil whisks us away
Our youth is dust
And our loves too
How beautiful to hear it sung with such sadness!
It melts my heart.
It's true, and I enjoy it.
Sing some more, for me.
You don't want to?
You don't want to hurt me, to make me cry, to make me as tender as a little lamb?
Too bad!
You're determined not to please me.
So be it! But take heed, I'll be back.
Renaud ordered me to modify your face and body so terribly
that no woman will ever love you!
Forget such things. Close your eyes, like I close mine.
Forget your chains.
Take me to our fountain.
It's so like you to forget your chains, to take refuge in happy memories!
Alas, I am here!
I have no ill intentions.
Memories are lovely, but the past is gone forever!
The present is what counts and right now, some surprising things are happening!
Look how clear the water is, like a cloudless sky.
What silence!
A deathly silence.
A grand tournament. Lovely ladies, fine weather, noble lords. There's your humble servant, seated on Dominique's right.
What a show!
Everyone is enjoying it.
Gilles, they'll fight to the death, I know it.
It's true, one of them must die.
Don't worry.
As a favor, I'll let you decide.
Give me a name.
Don't answer. There's no point. He's already decided.
You see?
A little blood can ruin the clearest water!
You should get some rest.
You're exhausted.
Renaud...
I already considered him as a son.
This is the hand that struck him...
These things happen.
It was just bad luck. He died at my hand.
Bells, always bells!
What an odd custom!
Yes, a man is dead, but why make so much noise?
Those bells are exasperating!
And Baron Hugues!
Poor Baron, isn't he exasperating with his empty words, his suffering, his remorse, his heavy sighs?
Dominique, you should take him away.
Where?
I don't know. Anywhere.
To the Devil, as they say! Out of my sight, out of everyone's sight!
It'd be pleasant to stay here for a while.
And Anne...
What do you think of her?
She's a charming creature, isn't she?
I've never seen anyone like her.
Do you think she really loves Gilles?
If she loves him, she's capable of loving someone else.
Who?
Are you jealous, my dear?
I was a child when you met me.
You know I'm incapable of suffering. I feel no pain, no joy, no pleasure.
Is it really necessary for me to take this old man away?
Yes, his time has come.
He's lived long enough.
He's had his fill.
It's a shame.
I'd have preferred to take the other one.
At least he was young.
You shouldn't take these affairs so seriously. They're as old as the world, and just as worn out.
Yes, it'd be very pleasant indeed.
Anne... may your chains fall.
Appear in the garden, on this bench.
What's going on?
Never happened before...
Finally!
You kept me waiting, dear.
You know I'm not here of my own will.
I'm so terribly sorry, but do me the pleasure of sitting with me.
Please don't cry!
It hurts to see such a pretty face twisted in sorrow.
Leave me alone.
My heart is sad, so sad.
I'm not used to unhappiness and now Gilles is in prison, threatened by the executioner,
Renaud is dead, and my father is in despair.
Could you be the cause of all these troubles?
What do you expect?
No one loves me. I amuse myself as best I can.
If you only knew how sensitive I am, how the slightest thing wounds me!
Whenever there's a new joy in the world, or a new love shines, you can't imagine my suffering!
I'd cry... if only I had tears.
I assure you, if someone loved me, it'd help so much.
Life would be so easy and pleasant if only you tried to understand me.
Truly, the love Gilles offers is derisory!
Whereas I...
But that's quite impossible, for I love Gilles.
Gilles! What use is he?
Do you think he hears you?
Yes, he hears me because I love him.
Anne, have no fear. I love you!
Don't listen to him!
He has no power over you!
Anne, my love! My life!
Alas, I fear my poor brother has lost his wits.
It's possible.
Sometimes I think I'm losing mine.
My guilty love for you made me kill Renaud.
Why are you dressed like that?
I'm leaving.
I feel guilty, too.
And yet, my wrongdoing was involuntary.
Who can blame you for being beautiful and desirable?
You don't know the whole truth.
Renaud fought without chain mail to please me.
That's why your blow killed him.
How horrible!
Why did you do it?
You have to ask? I believed Renaud quicker and stronger than you.
I feared the worst, I feared losing you.
Dominique. Yes, my lord, I did it out of love for you.
You say you love me, yet you are leaving?
I must go.
My life is yours now.
You know I can't allow you to go alone.
Wherever you go, I'll go.
Alas, my lord, how could I ask you to abandon everything for me?
Don't forget your promise, my lord.
"Wherever you go, I'll go."
You'll be mine because you love Gilles and it's the only way to save him.
If I wish, I can make him the most miserable creature in the world!
Impossible!
Surely, you couldn't?
Yes! I can transform him into any horrible thing I choose!
No, I beg you!
I can also make him forget you and send him on his way, carefree, without memories or regrets.
Alive, like everyone else.
He can't forget me.
Everyone forgets! He'll forget immediately.
You'll forget later. But I don't want to! If he forgets me, I'll never love another.
You prefer the company of a monster who remembers you?
At heart, I'm not a bad devil. I can make you happy, believe me.
Your every wish will be my command.
I have only one wish:
to return to Gilles in the prison where he calls me.
- Be quiet! - I want to be with Gilles.
Anne... Can't you hear him calling?
She makes a fool of me! And yet, I love her!
I was too sweet, too obliging.
That's no way to win a woman! All that will change!
Why so sad, Anne?
Look at me, think of me as if it were the last time.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
I don't know.
I love you so much that I fear one day you'll forget me.
Forget you?
But, Anne, I'd rather forget to breathe, forget to live...
I hope I'm not disturbing you!
Excuse me.
I'm waiting for your answer. I don't know the question, but don't answer.
It's a trap.
Nothing keeps you here, dear child, now that your father is gone.
- My father? - Don't worry about him!
He left with Dominique.
All's well that ends well.
There is a slight age difference. But what does it matter? They love one another.
Enough about them. Let's talk about us. And him.
Since he still interests you...
Be quiet! Leave her alone!
I know my fate is in your hands, but what do I care?
I love her and you have no power over her.
How do you know?
Anne, let's talk seriously.
Gilles wrote this himself and signed it in his own hand with his blood.
It was wrong, but he did it.
It's too late now.
Give me your answer.
If I say yes to you, he'll be free forever?
As free as a bird, like a fish in the water. Don't listen to him!
Please, Anne.
Will you accept to follow me, to try to love me?
Yes.
Finally!
What gorgeous sunshine! And what a lovely castle!
What? I'm imprisoned?
No, you're not.
You're free, totally free!
That's much better!
Can you tell me where we are, who this castle belongs to?
Is it yours?
It doesn't matter! I've no wish to know you.
I don't like how you smile at me.
Anyway, none of this matters.
I feel like laughing, for I'm alive!
The sun is shining, what more could I want?
You're so beautiful!
One only sees such creatures in dreams.
You're the prettiest girl in the world.
Why are you so sad?
- This is no place for you.
- Is she your daughter?
No, she's not my daughter.
I understand, and I understand her sorrow.
Life can be unfair. Youth should be spent with other youths.
Perhaps she loves you.
Anyway, it doesn't concern me.
Excuse me.
I kept my promise.
You're mine now. Forever!
No.
What do you mean, "No"?
I can't believe it!
You promised.
You swore.
I lied.
That's impossible.
You don't know how. You couldn't lie!
All the same, I lied.
That's the truth.
It's impossible!
Anne, pure as snow, clearer than spring water,
Anne, the only person in the world I trusted!
Why did you do such a thing?
How dare you!
All's fair in love.
To save Gilles, I'd have done much worse.
I've lost him. I'll never love again. And yet, without recognizing me, he found me beautiful and told me so.
Be quiet!
If you keep talking like that, there's no telling what I'll do!
Do whatever you wish, but please, let me return once more to the fountain where I was happy.
So be it.
Is that you?
What luck has led me here?
Are you alone?
Yes. The old man with you is gone?
Yes.
Now I'm even happier.
Are you thirsty?
The water is so sweet!
Your lips are sweet, too.
My love. I knew I couldn't lose you.
Anne! Get away from him!
No.
Nothing can separate us now.
For the last time, get away from him!
To stone, do you hear me?
I'll turn you to stone!
The silence I adore...
Deathly silence.
What's that?
What's that noise?
It's their hearts!
Their hearts beating! Still beating! Beating!
THE WORD
Father!
- Father!
- Yes, what is it?
- Johannes is out on the dunes again.
- Is he?
Oh, no.
- I'm going to keep an eye on him.
- I'm coming with you.
I'm coming.
- What's going on?
- It's your brother.
- Johannes?
- No, Anders.
- It must be Johannes again.
- Yes.
- I better come along.
- Yes.
- The poor thing.
- Johannes?
Doesn't he need our pity, so incurably insane?
- Maybe he's happy like that.
- You can't mean it.
- Put something warm on.
- Yes.
- Your father's going, too.
- I'm ready now.
I'll have hot coffee waiting.
I expect we'll need it.
Woe unto you, hypocrites!
You... and you!
And you!
Woe unto you for your faithlessness!
Woe unto you, because you do not believe in me, the risen Christ, who has come to you at the bidding of Him who made the heavens and the earth.
Verily, I say unto you,
Judgement Day is near.
God has called me to be his prophet before his face.
Woe unto ye of little faith, for only they who have faith shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
- Is Johannes...
- Yes.
What is that for, Johannes?
I am the light of the world, but the darkness knoweth it not.
I came unto my own, and my own received me not.
Why put the candlesticks there?
That my light shall shine in the darkness.
It's so sad.
He's quite mad
- I mean, thinking he's Jesus.
I wonder if he'll ever recover his wits.
It's all that reading that's turned his head.
Yes.
He should never have been encouraged to study.
I did it because he was gifted.
You wanted a priest in the family.
No, there are priests a-plenty.
What's needed is a man to stir people.
I saw his gifts, I thought he was the spark that could set Christianity ablaze once more.
I prayed with all my heart that he might have the voice of a prophet.
The reformer?
The renewer, yes, that's what I prayed for so earnestly.
See what has come of it.
We'd all better go back to bed.
- Good night, father.
- Good night.
- Good night, father.
- Good night, Anders.
I'll go and take a look at the sow.
Johannes will be his old self again.
How I've hoped he would get better, but he never will.
Why do you say that?
Miracles no longer happen.
Nothing is impossible for God, if we pray to Him.
Inger, I've prayed and prayed.
You must pray once more.
Jesus himself said that He will grant our prayers.
I know, Inger, I know. But what use have all my prayers been?
Can you know what your prayers have set in motion?
Pray and pray again, even if you think your prayers are poor.
Good night, little Grandad.
Good night, Inger.
I'll sit up a little longer.
- Inger...
- You do that.
Good night then.
I'm sorry for your father.
- I'm sorry for Johannes.
- So am I.
- But...
- But what?
Johannes may be nearer to God than we are, but your father...
I can't bear his godliness.
You're unfair to your father.
He's been unfair to me.
He's never reproached you.
No, but I know what he thought when I wouldn't participate in the piousness on this farm.
Mikkel, you do believe in God, don't you?
You know my views, Inger.
- You have no faith?
- Not even faith in faith.
But you have something more important.
What's that?
A heart, and goodness.
Yes, faith is not enough if you are not a good person, too.
And you are.
- But I have no faith.
- It will come.
- Are you so sure?
- Yes.
Just you see how warm you will feel then.
And how happy.
It's nice to be happy, isn't it?
Yes, Inger girl.
Now we must sleep, lass.
Good night, my big lad.
Karen, give that to the hens.
- You two must help me.
- With what?
- Well, Anne and I are thinking...
- Anders!
You haven't fallen in love with the tailor's daughter?
I have.
What's wrong in that, Mikkel?
Nothing, except it's the worst that could happen to you.
- The worst?
- I don't mean her, she's sweet.
- What is it then?
- What will father say?
That's why I need your help, if you're willing.
But what about her father?
What will he say?
You know they don't share father's views on religion.
But if Anne and I love each other... Mikkel and I agree with you.
- But...
- But?
But what... eh, Mikkel?
Damned if I know.
You'll help me, won't you?
Of course we will help you.
Why don't you go and talk to Anne's father?
- He's impossible to talk to.
- Try, at least.
Yes... yes.
I could try, of course.
What do you think, Inger?
Yes. You try. And I'll have a try with your father.
That'll be the hardest, but I'll try anything.
Thanks, Inger. I'm sure you'll manage.
- And you manage the tailor.
- I'll go there now.
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.
If only father doesn't become obstinate.
I'm more afraid of him becoming sad.
- Shouldn't you be cutting the reeds?
- Yes.
- Goodbye, my lass.
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- Anyone would think we're just engaged.
- We are.
We have been married eight years.
- Don't mess it up.
- Do I usually?
No, that was unfair.
Dear God, help me today also.
It's because the rain came in.
Grandfather...
- You made me jump.
- Did I?
- What did you say?
- Rain's getting in through the roof.
It certainly is.
Blasted rheumatism!
Coffee at this time of day?
It's so cold, grandfather.
Yes...
Biscuits, too. Home-made.
- You like my biscuits, don't you?
- Yes.
Are you looking for this?
Yes, thank you.
I did fancy that pipe, but it needs filling.
It's been filled.
You can do that, too?
I can do everything.
Except have a son.
Now, now.
Here you go.
Listen..
- Grandfather...
- Yes?
A corpse in the parlour.
What is he saying?
Be quiet, Johannes.
Shut the door.
So shall my Father in heaven be glorified.
There, there.
There, there, Johannes.
What was that he said?
Who cares about what he says, Inger?
Do you want another coffee?
Yes, please. A small one.
Thank you.
The new pastor just went into the church.
He hasn't called here yet.
He'll come one day.
Are Mikkel and Anders cutting reeds?
Mikkel left just as you came.
He preaches a good sermon.
The pastor?
Yes... but he takes rather too long to get to the "amen".
Yes, perhaps.
Grandfather...
- Yes?
- Will you help me?
Yes, I suppose, if I can.
You can.
You know Anne, the tailor's daughter?
Yes.
What about her?
Wouldn't she be a match for Anders?
So that's why we're having coffee.
Not really.
But... wouldn't she?
I won't discuss it.
- How can you be such a...
- Such a what?
...such a stick-in-the-mud farmer?
Like unto like, I say.
Grandfather, the only thing that matters is that they love each other.
Love comes with the years, Inger.
Dear grandfather, you know all about the world, but nothing about love.
Tell me... Have you ever been in love?
In love?
At least a dozen times.
- Just as I thought!
- What did you think?
You've never been in love.
Well, I've been married, I know that.
Yes... but surely with you and Maren...
- It was only...
- What was it only?
It was a farmer's deal.
Inger...
Maren was a good wife.
Just the right wife for me.
Forgive me.
Grandfather.
If you'll agree to Anders and Anne marrying, I'll promise you something that will make you happy.
And what is that?
Fried eel for dinner on Sunday.
Well, that's a deal, of sorts.
Grandfather.
And I promise you a boy this time. Are you happy now?
You're good at making promises, Inger.
- Do you agree?
- Inger, Inger...
Why go to so much bother?
Anders will get over it, and we'll easily find the right girl for him.
Then I'll tell you that he's not cutting reeds with Mikkel.
- Isn't he?
- No.
Where is he?
So that's it.
That was the reason for the coffee.
Yes, grandfather, it was.
When he gets back we'll say, "Congratulations, Anders", won't we?
So Peter the tailor is getting a son-in-law today.
And you a sweet, capable daughter-in-law.
I haven't asked for one.
Do consent, grandfather.
When he went off without a word to me?
And you knew about it, but never said anything. A conspiracy by my children, behind my back.
I'm damned if I'll consent.
Grandfather, where are you going?
Why ask?
Do any of you tell me where you're going?
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
In his shirt-sleeves, too.
Go and have coffee.
Yes.
And tell Hans to lay straw bedding for the mare.
Yes.
There you are.
What's the matter with you, grandfather?
Borgensgaard is going to the dogs.
- Nothing of the sort.
- Yes.
And Johannes will never be any different.
How do you know?
Mikkel won't be any different.
How can you compare them?
Anyway, what's wrong with Mikkel?
He's betrayed his forefathers' faith.
Mikkel is all right.
He has God in his heart.
And now Anders...
Sometimes I can't make you out.
You seem as if God has abandoned you.
Do I?
You're right, I'm not what I was. And you do know why.
Because God didn't hear you all those nights you prayed by Johannes' bed.
No, you're wrong.
It wasn't God's fault, it was mine.
If I'd prayed with faith, a miracle would have happened.
But I prayed because I thought it was worth trying.
If a father can't pray with faith for his child, miracles do not happen.
But our Lord might manage it.
I don't believe it anymore.
Do you know what I think?
I think that many tiny miracles occur all around us.
Our Lord hears people's prayers, but He does things quietly, without making a fuss.
Maybe.
I'll go and meet Maren and little Inger. School's finished now.
Is it that time?
- You'll come with me?
- I sure will.
Despite your rheumatism?
Damn that, I'm not a cripple yet.
No.
Peter Petersen.
Tailor.
The time is coming for me to go
I hear the voice of winter
For I also am only a bird of passage
My real home is elsewhere
If that isn't the little Anne?
Did you find anyone in?
- Yes.
- You got the money?
Yes, I'll leave it over here.
You do that.
Anne, can you see to the birds?
They must need water.
Listen, Anne.
I think you've been crying.
Did you meet anyone?
I met Anders.
- From Borgensgaard?
- Yes.
Did you talk to him?
Yes. They have fifteen piglets.
I hope you remembered what I told you.
Of course.
- You know you must be on guard?
- Yes, father.
And not let sin prevail.
- Yes, father.
- That's a good girl.
- Anne, bring in firewood.
- Yes, mother.
You know what I've been thinking, Kirstine?
No, Peter.
Being young Borgengaard's father-in-law may have advantages.
Anne would never go wanting.
True, but I was thinking of more than worldly advantages.
Was it not?
What were you thinking then?
What if we humble folk were to win Borgensgaard for God's kingdom?
That would be a great joy.
The idea turned my head, too, but then I came to my senses.
How, Peter?
I found I was thinking of the worldly aspect, rather than the heavenly.
Thank the Lord for opening your eyes.
Thanks be to Him.
Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost.
Come in.
Good morning.
I was just passing.
The Lord be with you.
What?
The Lord be with you.
Thanks.
Are you...
Do you not know me?
Are you the son of the house?
I am a mason.
I build houses, but people refuse to live in them.
Do they?
They want to build for themselves.
They want to, but they cannot.
And so they live, some in unfinished huts, others in ruins, while the greatest number wander homeless.
Are you one who needs a house?
I am the new pastor.
- My name is...
- My name is Jesus of Nazareth.
Jesus...
How can you prove that?
Thou man of faith, who himself lacks faith.
People believe in the dead Christ, but not in the living.
They believe in miracles of two thousand years ago.
But they do not believe in me now.
I am come again to witness for my Father in heaven and to work miracles.
Miracles no longer happen.
The church that has betrayed me, murdered me in my own name.
Here I stand, and again you cast me out.
But if you nail me to the cross a second time, woe unto you.
This is quite dreadful.
Is it you, Anders?
- Hello, Peter.
- What do you want?
Have you some sewing to be done?
- Not that.
- What, then?
Well, Anne and me...
I've come to ask you if I may marry her.
No. Definitely not.
- Couldn't we ask Anne?
- No.
- Why not?
- There's no point.
- Aren't I good enough?
- No, Anders, you're not good enough.
What's wrong with me?
The problem is that you are not a Christian.
- I'm not a Christian?
- No.
Not what we down here understand by a Christian.
I'm as good a believer as you and Kirstine.
But not of our faith, that's what I look for.
You'd better leave, we're holding a meeting.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Regards to the family.
- Hello
- Hello and welcome.
Hello and welcome in the name of the Lord.
Hello.
Hello and welcome. Please come in and have a seat.
Hello, Pastor.
I'm the eldest son, Mikkel Borgen.
- Hello.
- Welcome to Borgensgaard.
Thanks. Many thanks.
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
I expect everyone's out.
- Would you care for a cigar?
- No, thanks.
- Have you met anyone else?
- Yes... your brother, perhaps.
- Johannes?
- Yes...
- I hope he didn't offend you.
- No, no...
But was he born like...
We don't like to talk about it, but I can tell you.
Something happened.
- Was it love?
- No, Kierkegaard.
How?
Well, Johannes was studying theology, and it was going very well, but then he became enmeshed in doubts.
- It was too much for him?
- Yes.
A blow for the family.
Yes, you want to help, but there's nothing you can do.
Father's coming. Let's change the subject.
Good day, pastor. Welcome to Borgensgaard.
Thanks. Many thanks.
Hello and welcome to Borgensgaard.
This is Maren, and this is little Inger.
- Just the two? - At the moment. A cup of coffee?
Another time, perhaps. I must go now.
Goodbye, Pastor. And thanks for your visit.
You're welcome.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Let me...
Go and have lunch.
He seems pleasant enough.
That's what he's paid for.
Is Anders back yet?
- Did you speak to father?
- Yes.
And you might as well know his decision straightaway.
Yes. Anders must find a wife, but a wife of our faith.
- So you're afraid.
- Afraid?
If Anne's faith prevails on Anders, Peter the tailor will triumph.
Inger, you understand me.
When I took over this farm, there was no living Christianity in the parish.
I began on my own.
They railed against me in church.
No one supported me. A battle was fought for years, until the faith of this farm triumphed.
Now I'm to open my door to those sour people down by the marsh who fought against me?
No. I'm damned if I will.
- You understand me, Inger? - Yes.
Yes, grandfather, but...
- I'm thinking of Anders.
- I know Anders.
Anders is a good boy, but he's weak and easily influenced.
That's why he needs a wife of his own faith.
And is bullied into giving up his love.
Watch your tongue, Mikkel.
Don't misunderstand your father.
My God, he's coming now.
Back from cutting the reeds?
No, father, I've come from...
From...?
Congratulations, then.
Are you crying?
He refused me, father.
He refused me.
- What are you saying?
- He refused me.
- Who refused you?
- Peter the tailor.
- Anders...
- Peter the tailor said no?
Definitely "no".
And in the end he pushed me out.
My son was refused Peter the tailor's daughter?
Why, may I ask?
Because...
Because I'm not good enough.
Why aren't you good enough?
I'm not of their faith.
So we up here at Borgensgaard are not good enough for Peter the tailor.
Well, I'm damned!
Are we heathens up here?
I wonder if Peter the tailor is brave enough to say that to my face.
Anders.
Are you serious about Anne?
Would I let him push me out, otherwise?
A sensible answer at last!
Inger, my coat!
You get ready too, Anders.
- Tell Hans to harness the cart.
- It's done. You were going to the mill.
Yes, that's right.
You're the best father I could have.
Off you go...
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
The Lord knows what he's thinking of. A clean handkerchief...
Inger, you think of everything.
- And keep an eye on the sow.
- Yes.
And people say the age of miracles is past.
- I must go and unload.
- And I must do the dishes.
We, who are washed in the blood of the lamb, know that the Lord works His wonders among us from day to day.
Is it not a miracle that you sit there, Jenssigne, assured of salvation?
Is it not a miracle, Kristen, that the Lord guided you from your former ways to submit your will to Him?
Miserable sinner that I am, is it not a miracle that I give witness to you?
Is it not glorious?
Is it not beautiful?
Is it not blessed?
Praise be, glory to such a God.
Come in.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Welcome to our meeting.
I haven't come to your meeting.
I've come for a talk with you.
You are just as welcome.
Here you go.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Have you come alone?
No, Anders is with me.
We were about to hear a testimony by Mette Maren.
We are ready, Mette Maren.
I just want to say that I wish that each of you may find the Lord as I have found Him.
I went in sin, and I was crushed by it. When I was converted, I became the happiest creature on earth, and I praise and thank the Lord.
That's all I wanted to say.
That was a fine testimony.
Sit down, won't you?
Let us sing Number 13.
Sinner, cover not your ears
Listen to the voice of the lamb
Hark!
Its voice is full of grace
Come and rest against my breast
Number 82.
The Lord be with you.
Hello, it's Mikkel Borgen again.
Isn't the doctor back yet?
Have you now?
He said that?
So he'll be here soon.
Who?
The midwife's here, but she dare not do anything until the doctor arrives.
She has asked us to bring in a large table.
Wait. There's a car coming now.
It's him, thank God.
Goodbye.
What's that?
Thank you. Goodbye.
Things aren't going well with Inger, the midwife says.
Let's see how bad it is.
Think all of you
Come all of you
God's judgement will be
Salvation to all
Good night, brothers and sisters.
Our next meeting in Jesus' name will be this day next week, God willing.
Good night, my friend. Good night.
Welcome.
Go and put the kettle on.
Have a seat next to your father.
- Thanks.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Welcome. A cup of coffee?
Don't put yourself out. A fill of your pipe?
Don't put yourself out for that.
- Anders?
- No, thank you. Not now.
Bacon's going up, Peter.
But eggs came down yesterday.
Have you got many hens, Peter?
About as many as you have pigs.
Here's the coffee.
- Isn't Anne coming?
- I think not.
Why not?
I think it will make it easier for her to walk in the path of the Lord.
You hear, father?
You can drink your coffee in the kitchen.
I can if you like.
- If you agree, that is.
- You can do it anyway.
We three will drink our coffee out there, as you seem to be master here.
Peter...
On my way here I tried to see things from your point of view.
What did you conclude?
Our different views on religion shouldn't come between our children.
Anne will marry one of our faith.
We don't intend to take our Lord from her.
There's no point in talking, you never understand me.
And do you understand me?
Perfectly. I was once like you.
And that wasn't enough for you?
Right, Morten, that wasn't enough for me.
I don't wish to speak evil of you, or any of the others, but I'm damned if I can stand you.
What is it about us that you can't stand?
Above all, that stuff about conversion.
And what else have you against us?
I can't stand your undertaker's faces.
So I've heard.
You have a bright, jolly Christianity, while we are undertakers and killjoys.
But if you're so jolly, why do you look so sad whenever we meet you?
I feel light and free, because I know a place is waiting for me in heaven.
And the rest of us go straight to hell and everlasting torment?
Is that right?
Isn't that what you believe?
You've taken the words out of my mouth.
"And the dead rose up and began to speak.
"And He delivered him unto his mother."
Do you want to see the picture?
A beautiful picture.
You will see it better over there, Anders.
- Can we have more coffee?
- Yes, Peter.
You take it in, Anne.
So you're bringing the coffee.
- Should I, Anne?
- Yes.
Maybe just half, then.
Isn't your mother in the kitchen?
Yes, but Anders is there, too.
Thanks, dear.
Well, Peter...
Have you had second thoughts?
- What about?
- About Anne and Anders.
No, not yet, at least.
At least?
Morten, are you still completely satisfied with your God?
- I certainly am.
- Are you sure?
What are you getting at, Peter?
You are not satisfied.
Morten, come over to us.
Have you lost your wits?
- You would gain peace of soul.
- Never!
When you return, dust to dust, it will be too late.
- Come over to us.
- I'm damned if I will.
Morten, the Lord is the God of miracles.
He can lead you from unbelief and delusion.
- Unbelief and...?
- Unbelief and delusion!
You say that about my faith?
Do you know the difference between my faith and yours?
You believe Christianity is being mournful and torturing yourself.
I believe Christianity means the enhancement of life.
My faith makes me rejoice in life.
Your faith merely makes you long for death.
My faith is the warmth of life.
Your faith is the chill of death.
Anders.
One day it will dawn on you that we were seeking the true light.
What are you really seeking?
God, and nothing else.
It sounds good, but we regard you as being neither believers nor converted.
So in my judgement...
- In your judgement?
- You are lost souls.
In Peter the tailor's judgement we are all going to hell.
Anders!
Anders!
- Yes, father?
- We're going home.
- Shan't I have Anne, then?
- No.
And I say yes.
Devil take it if I have to drag her out of this penitentiary.
- Come, Anders.
- Father...
We're going now!
And good night!
Oh, Morten, can't you see you are incurring God's wrath?
I won't listen to your wittering.
It's the Lord you must listen to. You must be tried still further.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
No, not yet.
They're just leaving.
Well...
I see.
Well.
Good night. I hope she feels better soon.
Who did you hope would feel better soon?
Indeed, indeed.
- We live in a world of miracles.
- What do you mean?
Just as I say you must be tried still further,
- Mikkel rings up...
- And what?
...and says that Inger is seriously ill.
Inger?
- It must be the child.
- No.
- Something extraordinary.
- I'd better hurry.
This time I hope the Lord will reach your heart, however hard he smites.
What are you saying?
God help me, you stand there wanting my daughter-in-law to die.
If there is no other way, yes, I wish it in the name of Jesus.
- You do, do you?
- Don't!
- There's only one answer to that!
- No, stop it.
- Calm down, father.
- I have witnesses.
The great Morten!
Do you deny others the right to exist?
- Go to hell!
- No, I won't block your entrance.
You landowner lout!
- Is she having contractions?
- She certainly is.
Inger...
It's time for the anaesthetics.
Borgen, hold the lamp.
What has happened?
It's nothing.
She'll come round soon.
- How's her pulse?
- Not too good.
Remove the mask.
Come and help me.
Take the heartbeat.
It's rapid.
- Is the child still alive?
- Yes, so far.
But we haven't finished yet.
- Will my wife be all right?
- Keep quiet.
Hold the lamp nearer.
Put the lamp down. And get me a tub.
How big? That size?
How is it going?
Karen, fetch the little wooden tub my wife bought last week.
So the doctor's here. What about the midwife?
They're both here.
- Anything wrong with the child?
- It was in the wrong position.
- And Inger?
- If she is saved, we can be thankful.
Here you go.
Is it serious, father?
We two, Anders, are going to have a busy night.
- Are we?
- Yes.
- Praying.
- Yes, father. For Anne and for Inger.
For Inger. Anne, we can manage that ourselves.
Now go and lie down, and put your trust in God.
Won't we pray together, father?
My boy, when it's something really important, I prefer to pray alone.
Though, of course, it's always the Lord's will that is done.
Then came the Lord Himself, with His scythe and His hourglass.
All right, Johannes.
Why art thou afraid, thou man of little faith?
For I am not yet ascended to my Father.
Hold your tongue, Johannes.
And in His own country
He did not many mighty works, because of their unbelief.
Go to your room. Go to bed.
Well, Mikkel?
The child has arrived.
Was it a boy, as Inger promised me?
Yes, it was a boy.
You see, the Lord is...
He's lying in the tub, in four pieces.
Mikkel.
If only you could pray to God.
You can do that, father.
What are you on about now, Johannes?
Did you not see him?
- Who?
- The Lord?
The Lord...
The man with the hourglass and scythe.
He went with the child.
If you had believed in me, this would not have happened.
Now I can do nothing.
Oh God!
Oh God!
Oh God!
How great must thy need be, before thou hearest me?
Dear Johannes, if you want to make your father happy, go to your room.
Look.
Look.
What should I see?
Can you see him?
There he is.
Who?
The man with the scythe.
He's come back, to fetch Inger.
Will you be quiet?
Do you still reject me?
Johannes. Johannes...
No, no...
This is madness.
Yet what is madness and what is sanity?
Now you draw nigh to God.
One word only, it will cost you but one word.
No!
No!
No!
Go away!
They seek to gather grapes of thorns. The vine they pass by.
Go to your room!
You are driving me insane, too.
Grandfather!
Not in bed, Maren?
- Yes, I am.
- But...
- You shouted so loud, grandfather.
- Oh...
- I woke you?
- Yes, because we've been moved.
- You've been moved?
- Our bed is in your room.
- Do you know why?
- No.
Because we're going to have a little brother.
Who told you that?
- Mummy.
- Oh.
And were you glad?
Well, I wanted a little sister, but mummy said she'd promised you a little brother.
She said that?
Yes, and do you know what?
Now she's very ill.
Yes.
That's why our Lord decided the little boy won't come this time.
- Did He?
- Yes.
Now you can go and ask our Lord to make mother better again.
- Yes, but He's not going to.
- Isn't He?
No, because she's going to die tonight.
She's going to do what?
That's what uncle says, and then He's going to raise her from the dead, like the Bible man.
- What's all this nonsense?
- It's what uncle says.
But now you must go and snuggle down in bed, little Maren.
- Yes, grandfather.
- Good night.
- Good night, grandfather.
- My dear.
I can't bear it in there.
Have courage.
- I see how it will end.
- End?
Father, I don't think I can bear to lose her.
You're not going to lose her. God will...
- Father.
- Yes?
- If Inger dies...
- Mikkel. ...promise you'll see Anders and Anne married, so the girls have a home.
Almighty God, it mustn't happen.
Don't take Inger from us.
Let's go in to her.
I'll come with you.
How strong you are, dear old father.
Yes, but I'm holding God's hand, you see.
Come.
Uncle, will mummy die soon?
Do you want her to?
Yes, because you'll raise her from the dead.
I dare say it will come to nothing.
Why?
The others won't let me.
But what about mummy, then?
Your mother will go to heaven.
But I don't want that at all.
Little girl, you don't know what it is to have a mother in heaven.
Better than having her on earth?
You know it is.
Nonsense!
If we get hurt, we'll have no mother to care for us.
Nobody can hurt a child whose mother is in heaven.
When your mother is dead, she will be with you always.
But she is when she's alive.
Yes. But then she is very busy.
Yes.
She must milk the cows and do the housework.
- The dead don't have to do that.
- Yes.
Still, I'd rather you raised her from the dead, uncle.
- You would?
- Yes, because then we can keep her.
Child of man.
Please won't you raise her from the dead?
I will if the others let me.
Never mind about them.
How happy I'd be.
- Would you?
- Yes.
- Will you come and tuck me up?
- Yes.
And I'll get one of my father's angels to watch over you tonight.
And will you bless us, like you always do?
Yes, I will.
And He took them up in His arms and put His hands on them, and blessed them.
God, do not send death to us.
There now, Borgen.
- Don't say it, Doctor.
- It's all over.
What?
No...
She's sleeping soundly.
Let's hope there are no complications.
But. But...
Eternal praise and thanks.
Yes, it was a hard job.
It certainly was, Doctor.
Many thanks.
Now let's have some coffee.
Yes, of course.
Let's...
Karen, Inger's going to be all right.
Make coffee - from beans, understand?
Doctor, may I take a peep at her?
Yes, but quietly.
Good evening.
Good evening, Pastor.
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.
- You know...
- Yes, I know the doctor.
I saw his car so I thought I would look in.
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening.
Thank you.
My son's wife was...
she had to...
- I think she was expecting.
- Yes.
- The child died, but she is all right.
- I see.
Take off your coat, Pastor. Coffee is coming.
- I really must get home.
- The doctor can give you a lift.
Yes, of course.
Sit down. I'll just peep in there.
No, thanks.
She's sleeping like an angel, Doctor.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
It's like a miracle.
My dear Borgen,
I don't wish to hurt your religious feelings, but now I have some right to challenge you.
Which helped most this evening - your prayers, or my skill?
Our Lord's blessing, dear Doctor.
Ora et labora as the old monks used to say.
- You, too, believe in miracles, Pastor?
- Naturally.
Miracles are possible, since God is the creator.
- But...
- But?
Even if God can perform miracles, He doesn't do so.
How come?
They would break the laws of nature. God doesn't break His own laws.
- What about Christ's miracles?
- Those were special circumstances.
Oh, really.
In special circumstances your God allows a little deviation, then.
No, my good Pastor.
It's strange. Doctors always believe what's least worth believing.
Here you go, Doctor.
The Lord make His face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee.
The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee and give thee peace, now and for evermore.
Amen.
What was that?
Johannes, blessing the children.
I see.
I expect you know... you met him?
Forgive me, but don't you think it would be better for him in a home?
My boy is staying with me as long as I'm at Borgensgaard.
Johannes will get better.
- You think so?
- Just give him time.
One day a psychic shock will clear out the rubbish bin of his subconscious.
- He'll be his old self again?
- Exactly the same.
You see, the doctor, too, believes in miracles.
Yes.
I believe in the miracles my science has taught me.
- God grant that it happens.
- Let's hope so.
Well, I'll take another look at the patient, then we'll be off.
Yes.
I'm ready.
My heartiest congratulations.
Thank you.
You must be rejoicing over God's work here tonight.
Indeed I am, Pastor.
It's been a hard time.
Yes, yes.
Yet I wouldn't willingly have missed it.
I understand.
Well, Doctor?
She's sleeping beautifully.
Now you should go to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
On behalf of Borgensgaard, thank you for tonight.
Karen...
Remember, Karen, two geese go to the doctor at Christmas.
I'm not a vet.
They'll die under my treatment.
Are you coming?
Good night.
How is it going with Inger?
Well, Anders.
Much better than we expected.
That's good.
There he is again, the man with the hourglass.
He's come back for Inger.
Johannes, go to bed.
Look.
Now he's going through the wall.
It's the doctor's car headlights.
Johannes, Inger is sleeping.
Her life is no longer in danger.
Listen, it's the scythe.
He cut in error, the wrong swath.
It's the doctor, backing out.
Stop, will you?
Come back, do you hear?
You must.
He won't.
Go then.
In the hour of faith, you will be forced to bring her back.
Johannes, that's enough.
She has died after all.
What?
Suddenly, in her sleep.
Inger dead?
You must be lying.
It's your nerves.
The doctor saw her only a moment ago.
Come and see for yourselves.
She went stiff and cold in my arms.
I saw her lips turn blue, her eyes glaze.
The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
Shall we ring for the doctor?
If you think the doctor can bring back the dead, Anders, then ring.
He left here a few minutes ago.
Will you tell him that she has just died... Inger.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away.
She is not dead.
She sleeps.
You think so?
Do you want to see her sleep?
Show me the place where you have laid her.
If thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God.
The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
From God am I, the Christ, come hither and to God I shall return.
In the clouds of heaven...
Anders!
Anders!
Give me a hand.
Is he dead?
No, father.
He's not the sort that dies.
Even that mercy is denied us.
Mikkel, my boy...
Why should she die?
Why should we be torn apart?
It's all so meaningless.
- Meaningless!
- Mikkel, you know...
What do I know?
Only that all I loved and worshipped is to be smothered in the earth, to rot.
To rot.
CERTIFICATE OF DEATH
YE SHALL SEEK ME, AND SHALL NOT FIND ME.
WHITHER I GO, YE CANNOT COME.

Johannes!
Johannes!
Inger Borgen, faithful wife and dear mother has departed from us.
The funeral will be from Borgensgaard on Friday.
Mikkel Borgen.
Maren.
Lilleinger.
Our beloved daughter-in-law and sister-in-law, Inger Borgen with faith in her divine Saviour Jesus Christ, gone to eternal rest.
Deeply missed by all at Borgensgaard.
Morten Borgen.
Anders Borgen.
"But I say unto you,
"that ye resist not evil,
"but whomsoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek
"turn to him the other also."
We must be off, if we're to get seats in church.
Yes, Kristine.
Do you remember when Morten Borgen was here?
Yes, why?
I offended.
I'd say it was Morten who offended.
Perhaps... but my offence was greater.
Kirstine...
I should have turned the other cheek.
Aren't you being hard on yourself?
No.
Christ said,
"Leave thy gift before the altar, and go away.
"First be reconciled to thy brother."
Now let's be off.
We're going up to Borgensgaard.
- Not to the church?
- No, to Borgensgaard.
- Are you ready, Anne?
- Yes, I am.
Joyful, joyful
Is the soul that's at rest
None knows
Their day of sunset blest
Good morning
Good morning
Sings many a wild bird
Which by sunset is caged
And no song is heard
In the bright morning
Flowers dance, buds burst
By dusk a hailstorm
Lays them in the dust
Many a babe smiled
In the bright morning light
That lay still and dead
That very night
It will be a big gathering.
The priest will be here soon.
We'd better let them finish their coffee first.
Yes.
Well, Inger...
I suppose we'd better fasten the lid on you.
Mikkel!
Father!
Mikkel, let the pastor say a prayer first.
Of course, she must be seen off with bands playing.
That must be the priest.
Shall I admit the public?
Mikkel, you are breaking my heart.
All right, we'll wait.
Hello, Poul.
There she is.
There must be some purpose in it, or it would never have happened.
Spoken like a true believer.
Remember, Mikkel Borgen, even pain can be beautiful.
Yes, all that about beauty is very important, of course.
No news of Johannes?
We've searched everywhere, but no one's seen a sign of him.
It seems you'd better prepare for the worst.
Pray God he's been granted his release.
Shall I let them in?
First let me just...
Death is the gateway to eternity.
Through that gate this young woman has gone ahead of her dear ones.
If we grieve, it is only because we are thinking of ourselves, our loss, as we have no reason to sorrow for her.
So you must be thankful for the bright and wonderful memories you have of her, for the bright and wonderful hope you have for her in the life to come.
And to you, Mikkel Borgen,
I would like to say this.
If you can live your life with the memories you have of her, if you can raise your children in a way that would gladden her, then the two of you who loved each other will meet again and be united, never to part.
Shall we say the Lord's Prayer in silence?
Amen.
Thank you for those heartfelt words.
There is nothing to thank me for.
Father, look.
Peter, is it you coming here?
Forgive me for intruding, Morten Borgen, but will you take my hand?
It was I that struck you.
I forgot my Saviour's words.
I have asked His forgiveness.
So must you.
It's all in the past now.
No, because I must say something in front of this coffin, something you must all know before Inger is borne out.
I know you mean well, Peter, but enough's been said.
I want to say that Inger's place shall not remain empty.
Anne, come here.
- Have you brought Anne?
- Here she is.
Only our Lord can repay you.
Now she is yours.
Anne...
Now I have only my Saviour.
I shall never be parted from Him.
Oh, Peter.
This does the heart good.
Be gentle with her here.
Anne, now you must be the sun that shines on us all.
Thanks, Anders.
Peter!
Thank God!
Tears at last.
Karen, come now.
Because now it's all over.
Goodbye, Inger.
Thank you for everything.
It was all good.
We shall meet again soon.
Yes, Mikkel, we do meet again.
Goodbye for the present, Inger.
God gladden your soul.
Maren, say goodbye to mummy.
Goodbye, mummy.
She doesn't understand.
She's too young.
And the rest of us, Pastor, we don't understand, either.
That is true, Borgen.
Goodbye, Inger, and thank you.
Anders, the lid.
No!
No, you mustn't take her from me.
- You mustn't part us.
- No, Mikkel.
Come, Mikkel.
Her soul is with God.
You can see it is not here.
But her body, I loved her body, too.
Be strong and say your farewell.
Remember you are a son of Borgensgaard.
Goodbye, little darling.
Goodbye, Inger lass.
Johannes.
Yes, father.
Father!
Did you say "father"?
Is your vision restored, Johannes?
Has your reason returned?
Yes, my reason has returned.
None of you has thought of asking God to return Inger to you.
Johannes, now you mock God.
No.
It is you who mock God with your half-heartedness.
If you had prayed to God, he would have heard your prayers.
What's this, over my dead wife's body?
Mikkel, my brother.
Why, among all the believers is there no one who believes?
Inger...
You must rot, because the times are rotten.
Put the lid on, then.
Do hurry up, uncle.
The child.
The child.
The greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Do hurry up.
Do you believe I can do it?
Yes, uncle.
Thy faith is great.
It shall be done according to thy will.
Look at your mother.
When I speak the name of Jesus... she will rise.
Hear me, thou dead one.
He's insane.
Is it insane to want to save lives?
Johannes!
Trust in God.
Jesus Christ.
If it is possible, let her return to life.
Give me the word.
The word that can return the dead to life.
Inger...
In the name of Jesus Christ I say unto thee:
Arise!
Inger!
Inger.
He is still the God of old, the God of Elijah, eternal and the same.
Eternal and the same.
The child?
Is it alive?
Yes, Inger.
It is alive.
It lives with God.
With God?
With God?
Yes.
I have found your faith.
Now life is beginning for us.
Life...
Yes.
Life.
Life.
Good morning, Your Royal Highness.
Good morning to you.
Good...
Oh, I've caught one!
And what a fine one it is!
That's a fine catch!
Children, come here!
I've got a bite!
Papa's caught a fish!
- What is it?
- What happened?
Come down to the lake!
Papa caught a fish!
Children, come quickly!
What's taking you so long?
Come quick!
Have a look at it!
Isn't that a fine one?
It's got to weigh at least 10 pounds!
Mama, Papa caught a fish!
- Yes, this big!
- Happy fishing!
Someone has to hold the pole.
No, quiet, be still.
Let Gackl hold it. I have to go get the net.
Gackl!
Papa, Gackl fell in the water!
Just what I needed!
No need to be scared.
I've got the boy.
Do you have the pole?
Yes, but the fish got away.
Bravo!
Let's have breakfast.
Children, not so loud, not so fast.
Don't shout so loud.
Stop climbing on the table.
Max, take your hat off at the table.
- Are there enough left for me?
- I guess so. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...
That'll do.
Gackl!
You look like a wet poodle.
You too.
Thomas, change the princes' clothes.
Yes, they've wet their pants.
- I want to eat sausage, too!
- Me too!
Behave yourselves.
Max, you're eating like a lumberjack again.
Because it tastes great.
But you should be a role model for the children.
- They eat like me anyway.
- Yes, unfortunately.
- Where's Sissi anyway?
- She went for a ride.
And Nene?
She never eats white sausages.
That's smart, it means enough for us.
- Can we go play ninepins?
- Yes, off with you.
My poor head's pounding.
There you are. Just look at that.
Not a single one of them used silverware.
And Why?
Because you always eat with your fingers.
Sweetheart, you've been trying to train me for 25 years.
I'm trying to make sure our home doesn't go completely to the dogs.
After all, I have to think about the future. Five daughters, Helene is of marriageable age, and who visits us?
Mr. Johann Petzmacher.
Have him come in.
You fraternize with innkeepers' sons from Vienna.
Top of the morning, Your Royal Highness.
Good morning.
Hello, Maxl.
- Hi. When did you get in?
- Last night.
And you didn't tell me?
- Where have you been?
- At the new post office.
I spent the whole morning watching the mail clerk tele...
What do they call that new invention?
Oh, yes, telegraphing.
Quite interesting, indeed.
We've gone to watch ourselves.
Just think, he taps something out on his desk and you hear it in Munich.
I'm not the least bit impressed. I know how to telegraph myself.
Thomas.
Very well, Your Royal Highness.
- What did you telegraph him?
- To bring us the mild red wine.
What's new in Vienna?
Oh, just that assassination attempt on our Emperor.
All the Emperor's men are still quite shaken.
Trembling in their boots, night and day.
The only man at the Hofburg is Soferl.
When you say Soferl,
I assume you mean the Emperor's mother,
Her Imperial Highness, the Archduchess Sophie?
Yes, her.
And now Soferl...
Pardon me, Your Imperial Sister wants her Franzl, pardon me, Her Emperor, that is to say, Our Emperor...
She wants him to get married.
Is there any mention of to whom?
No, there's been no mention of that yet.
Ah, '49.
Excellent.
If you don't like this one, you won't like any.
I like them all.
There.
And now let's drink to your Soferl.
I can't say I like her, but if she gives me reason to raise my glass, then three cheers to her.
And to the future Empress of Austria as well.
Cheers, Max.
Wasn't that Sissi?
I bet she's riding that wild horse again.
Sissi!
Good morning!
Jump over the roses!
No!
Stop in
Use your spurs!
This is all too much excitement for me. A wonderful girl.
Mittermeier.
Here I am, Princess.
Did Gretl jump well?
- Great.
You should have seen her.
- Like a deer in flight.
- She'll have extra oats today.
- Yes, she deserves them.
- Where's the bird feed?
- I put it over there.
Come on, Gretl.
Here's the milk for Xaverl.
- How is he doing?
- Chipper.
But he won't let anyone feed him except Your Highness.
After all, I did find him.
Xaverl, come on, breakfast.
Barri!
Bella!
Bad dogs!
In the corner!
Let Xaverl have breakfast.
Xaverl, chase him off, push him away.
That's right.
Good boy. Don't put up with that brute.
That's right, Xaverl. Defend yourself.
Chase him away.
Get in the corner, you naughty dogs.
Come, Xaverl.
Come here.
You weren't expecting that.
Isn't that good, Xaverl?
Good morning, Princess.
Good morning, Mrs. Stoeckl.
How is your gout?
Well, I dare say I feel the rain in my fingers.
I'll bring you some rubbing alcohol.
But for external use only. She's always drinking it.
That's not true. I've never done that.
Good morning, Papa.
- Look.
- Cute.
See him keep an eye on those three.
Quiet.
Get on out of here.
You rode like a dream and jumped magnificently.
As a reward, I'll take you hunting with me.
Really?
What is it, Baroness?
This letter just arrived, Your Royal Highness.
From Vienna?
From the Hofburg?
This is magnificent.
Have Princess Nene come here immediately.
This is wonderful.
- You sent for me, Mama?
- Yes, my child.
Nene, I just received a letter from Aunt Sophie.
She writes about you.
About me?
But you mustn't speak a word of this to anyone. Especially not to Papa.
Aunt Sophie has expressly asked me not to.
This letter is for you and me alone.
But what does Aunt Sophie write?
She writes...
Mama!
- Mama?
- Yes?
Papa's taking me hunting with him.
That's no reason to go around shouting.
Well, what did Aunt Sophie write?
That she's expecting us on August 17th, in Bad Ischl and...
My God, I hardly dare to think of it.
What?
That you're to become the Empress of Austria.
- Me?
- Yes.
Imagine your luck.
Franz Joseph is young, handsome, powerful, rich.
Immensely rich.
The whole world will envy you.
What's wrong?
- Mama?
- Yes?
- Is Nene with you?
- Yes.
I wanted to ask her if she wants to join us.
No, Nene has no time for hunting.
Go alone.
All right, I'll go alone.
- Kisses!
- Yes, kisses.
Mama, Papa will get suspicious if we go to lschl alone.
That occurred to me, too.
What shall we do?
Maybe we should take Sissi along to make it seem like a perfectly innocent trip.
- Nene, darling, I'm so very happy.
- Me too.
But I don't understand any of this.
Franz Joseph hardly spoke ten words to me when we met in Innsbruck.
He had other things on his mind.
The revolution, flight from Vienna, the struggle for power.
But never mind now.
The important thing is that Aunt Sophie wants this marriage.
Because what she wants, she gets.
His Majesty.
Good morning, dear Mother.
Good morning, my dear Franz.
I'd like to be left alone with His Majesty.
Do you have a moment for me?
For you always, my dear Mother.
- Later.
You may go now.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
All right, Mother. What can I do for you?
Not here at your desk.
What I have to tell you is more of a private nature.
Come, let us have a seat there.
With pleasure, Mama.
You know, dear Franz, that I've always had your best interests in mind.
Yes, of course, Mama.
I didn't even lay claim to the throne myself so Austria could once again have an Emperor.
Now I want to ensure that the Emperor has a worthy partner.
- You want me to marry?
- Yes, Franz.
There are marriageable princesses in almost every country.
Too many nations have already sent out their feelers to me.
Rejections could easily lead to political disgruntlement.
I don't have any idea whom I would marry.
That is why I've made your decision for you. A choice that doesn't offend any country, nor does it privilege any.
My dear Mother, I have always been grateful to you for your advice and initiative. But don't you think that on this one point
Naturally, my son. Although you can trust me completely.
The girl who is to become your wife and the Empress of Austria has all the virtues you could wish for.
She is young, pretty, was raised in a strictly Catholic family...
- But I don't know her.
- Yes, you do!
You met in Innsbruck.
It's your cousin Helene.
The daughter of Aunt Ludovika and... And this is the only disadvantage:
Duke Max in Bavaria.
He's part of the package, unfortunately.
Interesting. Of the whole family, he's the only one who sticks out in my mind. And in a positive way at that.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Wonderful.
Always remember, my child, if you're ever worried or upset, go through the woods with open eyes. And in every tree, in every shrub, in every creature and every flower, the Almighty God will reveal Himself to you and give you solace and strength.
Did you know that I'm so very happy to have a father like you?
How happy I am to have you...
I can't even begin to describe.
But now we've got to keep mum or we'll scare off our buck.
My heart is beating so fast.
But quiet, quiet.
What have you got, Your Excellence?
The death sentences for the eight rebels in the Prague Uprising.
What sort of people are they?
High school and university students and artists.
Are their crimes so grave that they warrant such strict punishment?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Rebellion, sedition, and lese, Majesty.
Your Majesty, I must ask you to sign immediately.
Execution is scheduled for tomorrow morning.
But I can't decide the fates of eight young people just like that. Your Majesty, the highest military tribunal has decided their sentences.
Nevertheless, I'll have to study the files first.
Even Her Imperial Highness, the Archduchess Sophie, is of the opinion...
I believe I have made myself clear.
- Your Majesty?
- Thank you, Your Excellence.
Now we make the bed and tuck Gretel in.
It's her bedtime.
This is a jar. Right?
This is a doll, this is a cup, this is a small...
Seppl, give that back to me!
Fetch another doll.
Present arms!
What are you doing with my plumed hat?
That's not a toy.
Put it back in the cabinet this instant.
I can never find it when I need it.
What's that supposed to be?
Nymphenburg Castle.
The poor Royal Family. Oh well, it should do for their summer residence.
Watch closely. I'll show you something.
Now we wrap up little Hans nice and snug.
Watch closely. Like this.
Make sure we cover his tummy, or he'll catch cold.
Then we put him in the baby bunting, fold the covers over, and wrap him up tight.
- A new baby in the family?
- Oh, Max.
Tie it tight, or he'll fall out.
Now you try it by yourselves, and then Mama will come and have a look.
Go on.
What did Sophie have to say?
She invited me to lschl, for Franz Joseph's birthday celebration.
And I'd like to take Nene along and Sissi if it's fine with you.
I get to go, too?
Yes, you may come, too.
Will Carl-Ludwig will be there?
Yes, I'm sure he'll be at his brother's birthday party.
You're still thinking about that Carl-Ludwig.
You mustn't forget the ring he gave you.
Where did I put it?
In the sewing basket.
No, in my pencil case.
Oh, holy chaos.
If anything important happens, I can send you a wire.
But not to me, or the postmaster will tear me from my sleep again, the darn rascal.
Send it to Petzmacher.
He lives next door to the postmaster.
He can tell me the details.
All right. Then I'll wire that darn Petzi-rascal.
- When do we leave?
- In the morning.
So soon?
Wonderful!
Therefore, during His Majesty's sojourn in lschl all persons shall be subject to close inspection.
Close inspection!
A second attempt to assassinate His Majesty must be prevented at all costs.
Must be prevented at all costs!
Your Majesty, I realize what a tremendous responsibility is at this moment, upon my...
Pardon me.
Upon my shoulders.
But Your Majesty can count on me.
Guarding monarchs is my specialty.
- Have you done this before?
- Not yet.
But theoretically, I know every trick a bodyguard needs to know.
- Then I can rest assured?
- Absolutely, Your Imperial Highness.
I wish you a good night.
- You can go now.
- Where?
Oh, Your Majesty, Major Boeckl leaving as ordered.
For Heaven's sake, Sissi. What in the world are you doing?
Watering the horses.
That's the coachman's job.
Just look at you.
It'll dry in no time in the sun.
If I could, I'd send you back home.
And here comes Aunt Sophie.
Ludovika!
Sophie!
How happy I am.
And so am I.
- Good morning, dear Aunt.
- Hello, Carl-Ludwig.
Nene.
Why she's even more lovely than before.
- Hello, Carl-Ludwig.
- Hello, Nene.
I'm quite pleased, my child.
Why, it's Sissi!
You brought Sissi along?
I'll explain later.
- Good morning, Aunt Sophie.
- Hello, child.
Your hands are all wet.
Yes, I watered the horses.
Watered the horses?
So it wouldn't take so long.
Hey there, Carl-Ludwig!
Sissi, what kind of a greeting is that?
I learned it from him.
In Innsbruck we always said, "Hey there," didn't we?
Of course.
- I'm glad you came.
- So am I.
It's nice here in Austria.
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much.
I don't see why you brought that child.
Well, because...
Your mother will explain.
But she won't be invited to any receptions.
She'll stay with her governess far away from my guests.
Of course, she's still a child.
- Did you think of me sometimes?
- Are you kidding?
See.
You're wearing my ring?
You have no idea how glad that makes me.
Are you wearing mine, too?
- I never took it from my finger.
- That's sweet of you.
Sissi, if you hadn't come to lschl,
I would have gone to Possenhofen soon, right after the engagement.
What engagement?
It's still a big secret.
But why didn't Uncle Max join you?
We've got a magnificent hunting reserve here.
Chamois, stags, ibex.
Really?
I'll write him to come immediately.
Telegraph him. It's much faster.
Okay, but don't tell anyone.
I want to surprise Mother.
I see Mama getting ready to go. We should get going, too.
We're coming!
- But we'll see each other soon?
- Of course.
That's why all roads, walkways, paths, bridges, rivers, and so on, leading to lschl are to be guarded closely.
- Do you understand, gentlemen?
- Yes, Sir!
And any suspicious or refractory characters are to be cuffed.
- I mean, put in cuffs immediately.
- Yes, Sir!
Better to arrest one too many rebels than to let an innocent man get away.
- Yes, Sir!
- Dismissed.
What are you...?
Baroness, where is my basket?
It was in this chest.
- In this chest?
- Yes. It should be in here.
Heavens, Princess, all the beautiful dresses...
This is it. Look, darling.
That's beautiful.
Don't forget we should save the best for the ball.
We're going to a ball?
Not you.
But why not?
I know how to dance.
You're still a child.
Where is my Venetian shawl?
Sissi, do you like my hairdo?
It's lovely.
But it needs to be a little higher. Like this.
Sissi, what are you doing?
Aunt Sophie is expecting us for tea at 5:00.
- What am I going to wear?
- Nothing.
Nothing?
I mean, you're not invited.
Good. Then I'll go fishing.
My God, her beautiful hairdo.
Make it look nice again, please.
Here it is.
Sissi, why are you always making such a mess?
I was looking for my basket.
Go to your room before you drive me crazy.
Wait, Mama!
My fishing rod!
Go on, get in there.
Mama, don't lock me in here.
I want to go fishing.
You're staying right where you are.
My poor pounding head.
Why did I ever bring that child?
Excuse me, where's the next telegraph office?
- The next telegraph office.
- Straight ahead, straight ahead.
Straight ahead, thanks.
Stop.
What were you saying to that young lady?
What were you saying to that young lady?
- I didn't say anything.
- But I saw you motion something.
Yes, I motioned to her.
What did you motion?
Why did you motion?
The lady asked me a question.
What did she ask you?
What she asked you!
Where the next telegraph office is.
The telegraph office.
Why didn't you say so?
Move along.
Get going, I said!
All right.
Here.
Well, let's see now.
- May I watch while you telegraph?
- But of course.
Mr. Johann Petzmacher,
Possenhofen.
That's in Bavaria, isn't it?
Yes, by Lake Starnberg.
Post office.
Was locked up.
Yes.
Climbed out the window.
Send immediately.
- Can Petzmacher read that?
- No, they'll write it out for him.
Papili with rifles.
Emperor arrives today 4:00.
Sissi.
- This says "Sissi"?
- Yes.
Did you invent this machine?
No, it was invented by a Mr. Morse and built by a Mr. Carl von Siemens.
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.
Good-bye.
Wait, you have to pay.
Oh.
But I don't have any money.
And you had me send a telegram?
Look, I'll bring the money by later.
In the meantime take my ring.
Is it real gold?
I don't know. I think so.
Don't chew it up.
I'll be needing it again.
Twenty words. That makes 60 kreuzer. 60 kreuzer?
I think it's worth that.
You think?
All right, then bring the money by later.
Good day.
Good day to you, too.
Why, hello, Boeckl.
No informalities. I'm here on duty.
What did that person telegraph?
Where does this start?
- You can't read that.
- Why not?
It's just dots and dashes.
Here, you can read this.
"Was locked up."
An escapee, I thought so.
What are you telegraphing?
- Who's telegraphing?
- You.
Then move that thing.
"Climbed out the window."
Did she do something?
Quiet!
I ask the questions, not you. Got that?
"Climbed out the window."
Who's telegraphing now?
From Gmunden, he wants to know who just telegraphed.
I have to answer him.
Well, did you answer him about who telegraphed?
Yes, a klutz.
- I'm on duty.
- So am I.
Oh, I apologize.
"Immediately send Papili." Who's this Papili?
A Croatian name.
"With rifles."
That's an outright assault upon the Emperor!
An assault upon the Emperor.
An assault!
Of course!
She's headed in the Emperor's direction.
- My helmet. - A private matter.
No time for private matters.
But how will I get my money?
The girl had no money. All she left me was this ring.
What?
And you accepted it?
You're a fencer.
You're a fencer!
- I'm a what?
- A fencer!
This ring is certainly stolen.
- Give me the ring.
- It will remain in police custody.
When you're on duty, you're the biggest imbecile.
You've gone too far. Insulting an officer.
Stand up.
Postmaster, you're under arrest.
I'll come back for you later.
Where's the klutz?
I'm taking that with me, as corpus delicti!
What is it?
What frightened the horses?
- A rucksack on the road.
- Then get rid of it.
What's this?
Who's fishing there?
Me.
Oh, Your Majesty.
Don't tear it off. I'm coming.
Please, don't tear it off. Your Majesty, I'll have you free in a moment.
In Heaven's name, Your Majesty.
Give me that knife.
Your Majesty, I'm on the trail of a nihilist band.
I've been following this girl a long time.
Here's the rucksack.
Careful, there could be an infernal machine inside.
Then take it.
But, Your Majesty, he's crazy, I'm not a nihilist.
I believe her.
- But Miss isn't from Austria either.
- No, I'm from Bavaria.
From Bavaria.
- Earl Gruenne. - Your Majesty.
Drive on and tell my mother that I walked part of the way.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
And Miss can accompany me, if she has time.
Oh, yes, I've got time.
I suggest we take a little detour and have a look around lschl.
I'll just fetch my rod. Your Majesty, I beg you humbly to be ever so cautious.
- May I?
- Yes, please.
Did Miss at least catch something?
Yes. You, Your Majesty.
I must say, Miss is the first nice surprise I've met in lschl. A pleasure, Your Majesty.
How long will Miss be visiting?
I'd like to see you again.
Unfortunately only two or three days.
That's a pity, because in the next two or three days I will hardly have a free moment.
Or, on second thought I did reserve a bit of time alone.
Would Miss like to go hunting with me this evening?
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.
I've gone with my Papili many times before.
- Papili?
- Papili is my father.
And this Papili is a hunter?
A great hunter. The best I've ever met.
That's nice.
Tell me, is this the first time you've been to Austria, Nene?
Oh, no. We were together in Tyrol.
Of course. In Innsbruck three years ago.
In Innsbruck?
Ah, yes, the time we all simply took off.
Those were the good days.
- Would you like more tea?
- No, thank you.
I'd prefer schnapps actually.
His Imperial Highness would like a liqueur.
Your Imperial Highness.
His Majesty's carriage has just entered the grounds.
Let's go out on the balcony to greet Franz Joseph.
- Ludwig, come.
- Yes, Mama.
What's wrong?
Where's everyone running off to?
His Majesty's carriage just entered the grounds.
I see. Let's have another shot then.
Your Grace.
His Majesty's Adjutant General reporting.
Where is His Majesty?
His Majesty sent me ahead, as it was his wish to walk part of the way.
Alone?
Yes, that is... Actually, no.
His Majesty wasn't alone.
- Accompanied by whom?
- By a lady I didn't recognize. A lady you didn't recognize?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Thank you.
Come, my darlings.
- Look, there's Dachstein.
- Marvelous.
- Over there is my hunting reserve.
- It is?
The Hohe Schrott.
That's the Hoellen Ridge.
And over there, that's Jainsen Peak.
- It's beautiful here, Your Majesty.
- Right?
Then it's settled.
5:00 at Deer Bridge?
Yes, Your Majesty.
- And Miss will find her way?
- Absolutely, Your Majesty.
I hope Miss won't get lost in the woods.
Me?
Oh, no.
No matter how unfamiliar the woods are.
I'd like to ask His Majesty a favor.
Could you engage the Major in conversation to keep him from following me?
Certainly.
- Well, then?
5:00
- Good-bye, Your Majesty.
I'd like my rucksack, please.
And I'd like some urgent information.
Wait, Miss, I have a few questions.
Major?
Your Majesty?
First I'd like some urgent information from you.
Tell me, Major, how has the weather in lschl been?
Weather's been splendid, Your Majesty.
Excuse me, I must follow the lady.
She's waving.
- Oh, let her wave.
- Yes, Sir.
I noticed her immediately.
Yes, I noticed her immediately, too.
But tell me, Major, what I've been meaning to ask you.
How will the weather be the next few days?
Horrible, Your Majesty. It will rain without stopping.
- Do you have a weather frog?
- No, rheumatism.
I always feel the weather change in advance.
She's gone.
Gone. Vanished.
Tell me, what did you want from the lady?
I wanted to ask her for her name and address.
Why didn't you say so?
Run after her, quickly.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- And report back to me immediately.
Yes, Your Majesty!
Did you have a nice nap, Princess?
What makes you think I took a nap?
Because it was so quiet in your room.
I didn't want to disturb you.
No, I wasn't sleeping.
Just dreaming.
I can't wait to hear what Mama and Nene have to tell when they get back from the reception. Whether there were a lot of people there, and what the Emperor is like.
Charming.
Pardon?
I mean, he certainly looks charming in the pictures.
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm just wondering if he's changed much since Innsbruck.
Completely.
We were all children back then.
Yes, you're right.
Baroness, at 5:00 it will be quiet in my room again.
Maybe you could not disturb me then, too.
Good afternoon, Mama.
Hello, Franz.
- Good afternoon, Papa.
- Afternoon, Franzl.
It's good to see you again.
It's good to see you again, too. You look rested and well.
- What happened?
- You look rested and well.
Yes, I'm feeling better.
Like I always say, anything beats governing.
Franzl, Aunt Ludovika and your dear cousin Nene have come from Possenhofen to celebrate your birthday with us tomorrow.
My dear aunt, I'm so glad you could come.
The pleasure is ours, dear Franz.
Good morning, Nene.
I wouldn't have recognized you.
It's been a few years since we saw each other last in Innsbruck.
Yes.
You've grown quite lovely.
Thank you.
- Did Uncle Max come, too?
- No, unfortunately not.
But he sends his most cordial birthday greetings.
What a pity.
He wanted to deliver them himself, but he had to attend to urgent business.
All nine!
Right on the money!
Max, I just received a telegram from lschl.
- It's from Sissi.
- From Sissi?
What does she write?
She was locked up, climbed out the window.
She wants you to go there with your rifles.
Calm down!
You see I've got my hands full here.
Boys, set up the pins.
Ask Thomas where the beer is.
You write down that I knocked down all nine.
And you stay here and join in.
Please, Papa, let's go!
Scram!
I'm staying right here.
For once I can do what I want in this house.
Me leave now?
Out of the question.
You don't have any idea who the girl was?
No, Mama. I only know she was very beautiful.
The Emperor of Austria gets out of his carriage for a girl he doesn't know and strolls around like a love-struck student. And no less on the day his future wife sits here waiting for him.
L.m s or r Y , M a m a , that you've gotten so upset about this incident.
Nothing grieves me more than to know that I've caused you vexation.
Please forgive me.
All right, then. Let's forget this unpleasant incident and not speak of it again.
How do you like Nene?
I think she's very, very pretty.
Pretty?
I find her absolutely fetching.
Well, my child?
How do you like him?
I think he's very, very nice.
Nice?
I find him absolutely charming.
I just find Nene reserved.
My God, she's bound to be a bit self-conscious because she knows what's at stake here.
Does she know that we're to be engaged?
Of course.
But don't let that influence your decision in the least.
I've talked to Nene.
She's intelligent, devout, well-mannered, well-educated, and in her outward appearance she's positively predestined to be the wife of a monarch.
Yes, that's true, but...
Don't say anything yet, Franz.
Once you get to know her better, you will agree with me completely.
Come, go and talk to her a bit.
Not now, Mama. I want to go hunting.
You're going hunting now?
It's my only chance, Mama. I'm just here for two days.
Then at least spend an hour with your guests.
I can't, Mama. It's almost 5:00, and at 5:00 I'm meeting the hunters. And I don't like to be late.
But at dinner this evening and at the ball I will have ample time to get to know Helene.
As you please.
I'll go on alone.
Won't His Majesty be taking the loader along?
Nobody. Even the dog stays behind.
Good hunting, Your Majesty.
Good hunting.
Hunter's thanks.
Good afternoon, Your Majesty.
Oh, pardon me.
Am I on time?
I'm glad you came.
I'm glad to be able to walk in the woods again.
- It will get very steep.
- It doesn't matter.
All right, then.
His Majesty has gone hunting?
That wasn't part of the plan.
Not so loud.
That wasn't part of the plan.
How am I supposed to take precautions?
One has to expect the unexpected.
The woman His Majesty met on his way to lschl wasn't part of the plan either.
That's who I wanted to talk about.
Does the good man know her?
Certainly. His Majesty walked with her for quite some time.
Do you know her?
Oh, you mean me?
Yes, Your Highness.
Well, I don't know her exactly, but I do know that she's a thief.
- A thief?
- Yes.
Now the only question is whether she's just an ordinary thief. A lot of political criminals commit an ordinary crime to throw off the authorities.
Major, I didn't ask for a lecture on criminology. I want to know if this person has been arrested.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
And why not?
She just slipped through my fingers.
How did she just slip through?
Funny question.
Pardon me, Your Imperial Highness. That just slipped out.
Slipped through my fingers while His Majesty had me twisted around his...
That is to say, His Majesty engaged me in gracious conversation.
And the good man told me I could rest assured.
Excuse me, who did?
The good man.
Oh, you mean me again?
I'm glad Your Majesty loves the woods as much as I do.
A pity I hardly get the chance to walk through them.
Most of the time I'm behind my desk or reviewing the troops.
Then I pity Your Majesty, indeed.
Yes, yes.
If you're ever worried or upset in life, go through the woods like this with open eyes. And in every tree, in every shrub, in every flower, and in every creature the Almighty God will reveal Himself to you and give you solace and strength.
Did Miss read that somewhere?
No, it's advice from my Papili.
Ah, Papili.
He must be a wonderful man, that Papili.
Indeed he is.
- Your Majesty, mum's the word.
- What?
I mean, we have to keep quiet, or we'll scare off the stag.
The sure sign of a huntress par excellence.
- Quiet, then.
- Yes.
- Your Majesty?
- Yes.
Will His Majesty really shoot it?
Why else would I bring along my rifle?
Doesn't Papili shoot?
Sure, but I prefer to just look at the animals.
So do I, but today I want to shoot a stag.
- There he is.
- Where?
There.
He's gone.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
How could such a thing happen to a hunter?
I can't explain it. Please don't be cross.
No, no. I'll get him yet.
Yes, but not today.
No, not today.
But we can talk loudly again.
We can even sing our hearts out.
What?
Miss even brought a zither along?
Yes, Papa even took it all the way to Egypt, up the Cheops Pyramid.
Papili has been to Egypt?
Suddenly something inside makes him get up and go.
I think I'll be just like him one day.
A pity Miss will only be in lschl one or two days. I would have extended my vacation.
On account of me?
That's very nice, Your Majesty.
I'd like to hear about Miss now.
About me?
There's not much to tell.
My favorite pastime is riding.
Really?
Mine too.
My favorite flowers are red roses.
Mine too!
My favorite desert is apple strudel.
But that's incredible!
So is mine!
Really?
What's Miss's name?
At home they call me Liesl of Possenhofen.
Possenhofen?
Isn't that on Lake Starnberg, where Duke Max lives?
Yes.
Then you must know my cousins, the princesses Helene, Elisabeth, Mathilde...
Marie, Sophie, I know them all.
The boys, too.
I mean the Princes.
Gackl, Carl-Theodor.
As far as I know, Duchess Ludovika, Princess Helene, and Princess Sissi are in lschl, aren't they?
Yes, they came to wish me happy birthday.
But Princess Sissi isn't here.
- Oh, yes, she is.
- Really?
Don't you know her?
Only in passing.
And what do you think of her?
Nondescript, plain. But I like Liesl very much.
I never thought I'd envy anyone.
Who?
The man who'll have Miss as his wife.
What makes Your Majesty think of such a thing?
It's an imminent topic for me at the moment.
Is Your Majesty thinking of marrying already?
Unfortunately I must think of it.
Oh, is Your Majesty engaged?
Not yet.
But in love?
Not that either.
But I'm to be engaged today.
How can one be engaged to someone he doesn't love?
It's not so uncommon in our class.
For national interests, for dynastic reasons, for...
She must look like this. Have eyes like these.
This mouth. This hair.
She must be as beautiful as Miss.
But isn't your bride beautiful?
Yes, she is very beautiful. But Miss... Miss is much more beautiful.
I think Miss has more heart, too.
Who is she?
I'm sure she's a Princess.
Maybe I know her.
- Of course Miss knows her.
- Really?
Princess Helene in Bavaria.
Nene?
But let's not always talk about me.
- Nene?
- I'm so glad I met you.
I think, one could adore Miss.
No, a man would be mad not to adore Miss.
- Liesl.
- No, Your Majesty, please.
But, Liesl, what's wrong?
Miss is suddenly changed.
Liesl, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Liesl!
Liesl!
Stop, Liesl!
Do you know what Aunt Sophie said?
What?
She said you've raised Nene to be an Empress.
Sissi, where have you been?
I thought you were sleeping. I didn't want to disturb you.
I was walking in the woods.
I see.
Mama, now we can tell Sissi why we're here.
Yes, of course.
Sissi, a big surprise!
I'm being engaged to Franz Joseph today, and I can't tell you how happy I am.
He looks fantastic. Not at all like the pictures.
You can't imagine how charming he is.
I'm glad you're so happy, Nene.
Sissi!
Sissi, dear, what's wrong with you?
You seem upset.
Don't you feel well?
What's wrong?
Nothing, Mama.
Or are you sad because you weren't invited?
I've got wonderful news for you.
Prince Khevenhueller arrived unexpectedly, we're short a lady, so Aunt Sophie has invited you to dine with us tonight.
No, Mama, I don't want to go. I want to stay home.
But, Sissi, for Heaven's sake, you can't.
You'd insult Aunt Sophie if you didn't accept her invitation.
Yes.
I don't care.
I'm not going.
But, Sissi, please.
You're being moody. Don't annoy me.
Any other princess would be happy to be able to come to this dinner.
But I'm staying home.
What's wrong with her?
I have no idea.
But she's coming.
- We can't afford to upset Aunt Sophie.
- That's right.
And of all nights on one that very well may decide the future of our dynasty.
Good evening, Your Excellence.
His Grace, Field Marshal Count Radetzky.
I am pleased, Count Radetzky, that you made the arduous journey to visit me in lschl.
It is a great honor and distinction for me to be here to celebrate Your Majesty's birthday this evening.
Her Majesty, the Queen of Prussia.
Welcome, dear Aunt.
I'm so glad you could make it.
And I'm so happy to be able to wish you a happy birthday in person.
Her Majesty, the Queen of Saxony.
Welcome, dear Aunt. I'm so glad you could make it.
And I'm so happy, dear Franz, to be able to wish you a happy birthday in person.
Her Royal Highness, Duchess Ludovika in Bavaria.
Her Royal Highness, Princess Helene in Bavaria.
Her Royal Highness, Princess Elisabeth in Bavaria.
Welcome, dear Aunt.
Welcome, Nene.
Welcome, Elisabeth.
- You've already met.
- How?
In Innsbruck.
Of course.
I'm glad to see you again.
Liesl of Possenhofen.
Hello!
Come, my darling.
Good evening, my child.
- Franz.
- Yes.
Lead Nene to the table.
Yes, Mama.
I must say, I wouldn't have recognized Sissi.
In Innsbruck she was such a plain child.
Now she's the most enchanting girl I've ever seen.
Forgive me, Nene. Don't be upset.
Why should I be upset?
Because it isn't very gallant to rave to a lady about another lady.
But Sissi is my sister. I think she's charming, too.
She gets more beautiful every day.
She really is quite charming.
A pity that Max isn't here. I do like that man.
I'll let him know.
What did you say?
I'll let him know.
His big toe?
Oh, dear...
What happened?
Max has an inflamed big toe.
Just like mine.
What did you say?
I said just like mine.
Oh, otherwise he's fine?
Yes, bravo.
Sissi, may I reserve space on your dance card?
My pleasure.
How many dances can I have?
As many as you want.
- Even the cotillion?
- Yes.
And what's your favorite flower?
My favorite flower?
What is it?
Your favorite flower?
For the cotillion.
Oh.
Red roses.
Red roses.
I gave you an exact description of the girl.
- We haven't found her, Major.
- Why not?
All paths, trails, roads and bridges to lschl have been closed off.
All houses searched. Where is she?
Maybe she'll be at the parade tonight.
Sure, she'll march right into your arms.
Or maybe tomorrow at church. An assassin doesn't go to church.
She'll show up when it's too late. At the next assassination, this will cost me my head.
He laughs.
Why, you...
Dismissed!
Outrageous, this...
How dare you?
Get out of here!
Unbelievable!
In position!
Please, Duchess.
Thank you, Your Excellence.
So, Nene will be the future Empress of Austria.
Why do you think that?
If Franz Joseph leads a Princess to the table despite two Queens present, there must be a reason.
It's just odd for you to keep your plans a secret from your sisters.
But my Dear!
- Isn't Nene lovely?
- Yes, but hands off.
Why?
One ought not encroach on an Emperor's territory.
Oh, really?
Chamomile tea, Your Imperial Highness.
Did you put in some cognac?
Yes, Your Imperial Highness.
Thank you.
Why are you smelling your tea?
I was just making sure it's not too strong. But it's more on the weak side.
I just wanted to let you know.
Franz Josef is going to get engaged to Nene today.
- Please speak up.
- I can't shout.
Franz Josef is going to get engaged to Nene today.
Bravo!
Have the two fallen in love with each other?
No, not yet, but that will come.
Bravo!
Then why are they getting engaged already?
We got engaged without being in love.
Yes, that was a decision of the Congress.
Yes, and today it's my decision.
Bravo.
Stop saying "bravo" all the time. You're not at the circus.
- Pardon, what's wrong?
- You're not...
Everything is just fine.
Bravo.
Carl-Ludwig, I can't dance anymore.
- Why not, Sissi?
- I don't feel well.
Let's get some fresh air in the garden.
No, please. Just let me be.
- Don't you want me to join you?
- No, please don't.
What's wrong, Sissi?
Why did you run away this afternoon?
Do you really need an explanation?
I think that fate has other plans for us than the ones our mothers have made.
It can't be just a coincidence that we ran into each other today, far away from all courtly constraints.
Why, everything is perfect.
What's perfect?
Mama wanted me to get engaged to Aunt Ludovika's daughter.
I've never before been so happy to fulfill a wish.
Sissi...
I love you. Will you be my wife?
No, never.
Why not?
I won't interfere with Nene's happiness. And I'd never steal a man away from her.
But, Sissi, be reasonable.
You're not stealing me away from her because I'm not hers.
And as far as interfering with her happiness goes, I don't know if being my wife means happiness.
It's true, I'm the Emperor of Austria, the leader of a powerful country, but danger lurks everywhere.
The rebels in Milan, the unrest in Hungary.
I take my obligations very seriously, Sissi.
I won't have a lot of time for my wife.
Nevertheless, Sissi,
I would be happy to have beside me a woman like you.
Don't you remember what I told you today?
Before I knew who you were.
She must look like this. Must have these eyes. This mouth.
Please, don't say another word, or I'll forget my manners and run away.
But, Sissi.
By the way, don't you think Franz is neglecting Nene a bit too much?
I thought he'd at least open the ball with her.
Franz never dances until the cotillion, and he'll definitely dance with Nene.
And incidentally, don't worry. Everything will go as I please.
I trust you completely.
Won't you help me bear this heavy burden?
What if Nene didn't exist?
But she does. And I love Nene.
I'd never have the heart to hurt her.
And she loves you.
She told me.
Franz.
Yes, Mama?
I'd like to have a few words with you.
But of course, Mama.
Excuse me, Sissi.
- You looked wonderful, darling.
- Really?
All eyes were on you. Of course everyone already knows.
Yes, I noticed.
- Aunt Sophie said--
- What did she say?
She said Franz Joseph will dance the cotillion with you.
That's what I thought.
And, at that point, announce your engagement.
I'm so happy.
My dear Franz, it's time you announced your engagement. And I wanted to ask you if you've made a decision.
Yes, Mama, I've made my decision.
I'm glad. Then I can announce your engagement.
Everyone already suspects you're getting engaged to Nene.
Mama!
I won't be marrying Nene.
I've chosen Sissi.
What?
Sissi?
Do you know what you're saying?
I know exactly, Mama.
But, Franz!
You can't marry that impudent girl. A child, barely 16, ill-mannered.
Sissi will be an Empress like no other before her.
In the worst sense!
In the best sense, Mama.
She's charm personified.
And her sweetness is so sincere. I've never seen anything like it.
Sissi is precious, and I'll let no one take this treasure away from me.
My decision is final.
I'm marrying Sissi or no one.
And I ask you, dear Mama, to ask Aunt Ludovika in my name for Sissi's hand.
I'll ask Uncle Max myself.
You leave me no choice.
Unfortunately, I must do the same to Sissi.
I am sincerely sorry, Mama, that for the first time you and I do not agree.
Messieurs, please choose your corsages for the cotillion.
Sissi, what's wrong?
You were already so troubled this afternoon, and now...
I don't like this one bit.
- What is the matter?
- Nothing, Mama.
Then laugh a little, and dance.
You're young.
I don't feel like dancing.
At least cheer up a little, for my sake.
Who did you promise the cotillion to?
- Carl-Ludwig.
- Then dance with him.
Please?
As you wish.
Sorry, Your Highness, I'm out of red roses.
His Majesty reserved them all for himself.
Who do you need red roses for?
For Sissi.
- Isn't she lovely?
- Yes, but hands off.
Oh, and why?
One ought not encroach on an Emperor's territory.
What are you saying?
That I have keener eyes than you.
Excuse me. I'm looking for Carl-Ludwig.
I promised to dance the cotillion with him.
That doesn't matter now.
Come here.
Let me have a look at you.
Yes, Aunt?
Well.
You're not very tall, are you?
No, unfortunately not.
But it runs in the family.
Mama isn't tall either. And neither are you.
Above all, I'll ask you to address me with more formality.
But, you're my Aunt.
Franz Joseph is my son, yet he uses formal etiquette with me.
All right, as you wish.
Pardon.
As Your Majesty wishes.
It just seems so silly.
So unusual.
You'll have to become accustomed to many things.
The Austrian court adheres to a strict ceremonial:
The Spanish court ceremonial, which must be upheld under all circumstances.
That is my wish, and the wish of the Emperor.
Which languages do you speak besides German?
English and French.
You see.
Hungarian, Bohemian, Croatian.
You must speak them, too.
Why?
Because Franz Joseph told me he loves you.
And...
Because he wants to make you his wife.
But I told him--
Don't interrupt me. Just answer my questions.
I want to know if you love him, too.
Please, don't ask me that.
I'd like an answer to my question.
Yes, I love him.
I love him very much, in fact.
- But I told him--
- I hear, you ride several hours a day.
I have nothing against riding, because it's good for the figure. But don't overdo it.
You have to think of your health now.
Your teeth are yellow.
You have to brush more.
I brush my teeth. My teeth are white.
Your unmannerly nature will have to go, too.
You'll have to change your life altogether if you want to be Empress of Austria.
But I don't want to be Empress!
Be happy if it comes to pass.
I was happy at home until now, too. Perhaps happier than all of you here.
I refuse to change my ways and live any differently than now. I want to be free without constraints.
What kind of language is that?
The language my father taught me, who holds freedom and truth above all else.
I think for the time being we have nothing more to say.
- Sissi, where are you going?
- Home.
Now, when it's time for the long-awaited cotillion?
Forgive me, but I'm not dancing.
But I won't let you leave. I insist on my dance.
And if I beg you to let me go?
Your Majesty, here are your roses.
Thank you.
Sophie, our wish is about to come true.
I'm afraid you're mistaken, dear Sister.
Why?
He's going over to Nene with the roses.
Dear Sissi, allow me to present you with your favorite flowers.
He's giving Sissi the flowers?
What's the meaning of this?
That he won't be asking Nene to marry him.
Dear Nene, I asked you for the cotillion, but now I ask you to let me dance with Sissi,
with my future bride.
He wants to marry Sissi?
Yes.
Long live the future Empress of Austria!
Allow me, Your Majesty, in the name of all the distinguished guests here tonight and as the eldest of them all, to wish Your Majesty the very best for Your Majesty's engagement to Her Royal Highness,
Princess Elisabeth in Bavaria.
Congratulations.
I thank you, Field Marshal.
Your Majesty.
In honor of His Majesty's birthday the people have arranged a fireworks display.
That's nice.
My poor child, I feel so sorry for you!
Oh, Mama, why did we ever come to lschl?
The humiliation.
Nene, you have to be strong and show poise.
And believe me, Sissi's not to blame.
I know.
You mustn't be angry at her.
Nene, please, pull yourself together and don't show that you've been chagrined.
Please, I beg of you.
I can't, Mama.
I can't.
Why have you done this?
Why have you forced this fait accompli upon me?
Because I knew you would never have said "yes."
Well, Ludovika, come toast with your sisters.
You've brought a monarch into the family, too.
Why are you crying?
You have no reason to cry.
I'm the one who deserves pity.
I must hew an Empress out of a country girl.
But I'll take her in hand.
You won't need to, Sophie. Sissi will be a good Empress.
Perhaps, thanks to me.
In one year, you won't recognize her.
I'd say you won't recognize her in a year.
Well, bravo!
Now you said it.
Why, that's... His Majesty's future wife.
Mayor, where is my hat?
- Why do you need your hat?
- So I can eat it.
Long live the Emperor!
Whose turn is it?
This liver isn't from a pike
It's from rhinoceri
Enjoy this wine And thanks be to the father Of the bride
Enjoy this wine And thanks be to the father Of the bride
This liver isn't from a pike
This liver's from a deer
I'm tired of wine I'd like instead A frothy mug of beer
I'm tired of wine I'd like instead A frothy mug of beer
Sissi, what's wrong?
Why are you all alone and so sad?
Not like a happy bride at all.
- Have you heard from Nene?
- Of course.
She's still at Aunt Elisabeth's in Potsdam.
She's having a wonderful time.
She met a Prince Thurn und Taxis whom she is quite fond of and who's courting her.
But she isn't coming back because she hasn't forgiven me for ruining her life.
But, Sissi!
You listen to me.
You didn't ruin her life.
Look, things happen the way they're meant to happen.
Aunt Sophie wanted to decide fate, but no one can do that.
Franz Joseph liked you better than Nene.
You ought to be happy, for he loves you with all his heart.
And you do, too, don't you?
And that's what's important.
But I can't be happy as long as Nene is angry at me and won't come home on account of me.
What?
At this hour?
What's going on?
A royal messenger for me.
- What's he want?
- I don't know.
But don't stop. I'll be right back. A hearty toast to me.
Long live our host
Three cheers to him Good old Duke Max
Count Arco, what a surprise.
Please forgive me for disturbing you so late, but I was unable to get here earlier.
You got caught in the storm?
It was heavy, wasn't it!
I've been sent by His Majesty the King, to wish you, Duke Max in Bavaria, and your family all the best on behalf of His Majesty.
How nice of His Majesty to congratulate us by special messenger.
- Yes, charming.
- Good evening.
I have another special message to deliver.
- Oh, really?
- Unfortunately a bit unpleasant.
His Majesty wishes to remind Your Royal Highness that Your Royal Highness is no longer a private subject, but has become a public figure.
In other words?
His Majesty asks that Your Royal Highness from now on... Lead a more moderate life.
Then tell His Majesty
I want my husband to stay exactly the way he is.
But Your Royal Highness!
We've always been happy.
And no one bothered about us, not even the King.
So let Him leave us in peace now, too.
Yes, but...
Vickerl, you're a sport.
Hold this, Count.
If I hadn't married you long ago, I'd marry you this instant.
Sorry.
Inform His Majesty of our idyllic family life.
Our best regards, and we'll leave things as they are.
If he doesn't like it, let us know, and I'll become an Austrian.
But Your Royal Highness...
Franz will arrange it for me in a snap.
Yes, Sir!
Come, Xaverl.
Into the woods with you.
Go on.
And take care, will you?
And when you're grown up, don't cross paths with Papi.
Who shouldn't cross paths with me?
Xaverl.
But, Sissi, what are you doing?
At least my animals should have their freedom if I have to give up mine.
What's this nonsense?
Every Princess would consider herself lucky in your place, and here you are, making a face as long as a wet week.
Listen to me.
I just got a letter.
The wedding is scheduled for April 24.
On the 20th you'll take a ship down the Danube to Austria.
My, what a wonderful surprise!
Hello, my Dear!
Prince Thurn und Taxis brought me here.
He wanted to pay his respects.
Dear Prince, it's my pleasure to welcome you.
The pleasure is mine, Countess.
Oh, thank you.
What's wrong?
Aren't you listening?
You act as if none of this interests you one bit.
Don't you like Franz after all?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I like him very much, indeed.
I'm just so scared of Aunt Sophie and the court ceremonial.
I understand.
I always abided from a distance.
But you know what?
If they give you a hard time in Vienna with their fussing, you come visit me, and we'll go to the woods again.
No, now it's up to Franz to take you.
Won't Sissi be surprised!
Where is she?
Down there with her animals.
Sissi, Nene is here!
Come.
What?
Nene is here!
I just wanted to tell you that we'll always stay the way we were, and that I wish you all the best. I hope you'll be as happy as I am.
I'm so glad you're telling me this.
Indescribably glad!
Otherwise, I could never have been happy.
Long live Elisabeth!
Your new home is a beautiful country, Sissi.
Yes, it's as if I'm dreaming.
The ship!
She's coming!
Could you please tell me what you're looking for?
Good morning, Aunt.
I've been following you through several rooms.
You've gone from one window to the next.
Is something wrong?
- Can't you sleep?
- Oh, no.
I was looking for the animals.
Which animals?
Franz Joseph told me that Schönbrunn has a big park full of animals.
So you're out here in your nightgown and robe?
With your hair down?
Barefoot?
No one saw me.
- Franz Joseph could have seen you.
- He's asleep.
You're mistaken.
The Emperor is usually at his desk at this time.
Oh, forgive me. I didn't know.
Stay here.
You'll get lost with all these rooms.
Countess Auersperg.
Very well, Your Imperial Highness.
Why did you send for the Countess?
So she can show you to your room.
But that's not necessary.
I'll decide what's necessary.
Once you're in your room, you can prepare for confession.
It was unnecessary for you to remind me. I've already prepared myself.
And I speak the languages you deem so important:
Croatian, Bohemian, and Hungarian.
And my teeth are whiter than ever.
Just the tone you use to speak to me is unchanged, I notice.
What happened?
You see, was it necessary for your groom to see you in this get-up?
- Good morning, Franz.
- Good morning, Sissi.
- Did something happen?
- No.
I was just looking for the animals you told me about.
But, child, you can't see them from here.
I'll show them to you later.
Good morning, Mama.
That's certainly no reason to get in a huff.
Thank you for the lecture.
I'm sorry that on your wedding day we've had to get in this argument, but... I called for the Countess.
Good morning, Countess.
No, please don't.
More insolence!
Thank you. I won't be needing you.
Why do you insult my lady in waiting?
I don't feel comfortable having an older lady kiss my hand.
- Then let me explain--
- Excuse me, Mama.
May I?
This gesture has nothing to do with an age difference.
This evening, once we have been officially wed, you will be the First Lady of my empire.
In other words, you will have the position my mother has held until now.
You will be the First Lady of our country, and the other ladies will show with this hand kiss that you, as their Empress, are above them.
Only one woman in Austria may kiss your forehead instead of your hand.
My mother.
Right, Mama?
That's what you wanted to say, isn't it?
Yes, Franz.
Come, my child.
I'll bring you to your room.
Yes.
Everything would be wonderful if you weren't the Emperor.
With open arms we greet our dear bride,
Her Royal Highness, Princess Elisabeth in Bavaria, here in Austria once again.
And from the bottom of our hearts we welcome her to her new family.
May Austria be to her a new home and a second fatherland.
And may you, dear Elisabeth, always be happy in your new home.
What I can do, I shall.
Everything else is in the hands of the Almighty.
Long live the Royal couple!
Long live the Royal couple!
Long live-- Oh, pardon me!
- Long live Elisabeth!
- Well, Baron...
- Your Majesty?
Are you happy with the end of the wedding?
Sure.
The work have been accumulated... and I have little time for the Empress.
The ministers are already here.
Send them in.
Please, gentlemen.
Excellency, make your report.
The fact that created some problems in the Congress... was the amnesty that Your Majesty gave to the Hungarians. And I do not hesitate to say that... All the ministers were against this amnesty.
Why?
We all have the same opinion that the amnesty represents... a new and great danger to the Austrian nation.
It will be worst if we consider them our enemies.
I will give the amnesty, even against the ministers will.
I could...
The amnesty will be given immediately.
The countess Sofia!
I need to speak in private with the baroness Esterhazy!
Baroness Esterhazy, I nominated you master of the Empress... because of the great confidence I have in yours.
Everything the Empress does, it must be informed to me. This way, I'll have conditions to conduct better the life of this young lady!
Concerning to the mutual confidence... I'll report myself the best way is possible.
What do you have to report?
One more time, they brought a new parrot. I ask your permission to lock it in the backyard... because the scream is terrible.
If the Empress likes animals so much... you must keep them where she wants!
And if the noise bothers you... I suggest you to put cotton in your ears!
Open this drawer.
- What book is that?
- The Empress' diary.
Give me it.
Do you have anything else to report me?
The Empress complains of our installations for the bath.
Maria Teresa lived and took bath here. For someone that is empress by accident, it's very good!
- What else?
- She asked if... colonel Böckl from Ischl did not show up for an audience. Böckl?
From Ischl?
I do not know him!
So, mister, look at me!
Don't you remember me, mister?
- Have you a hair cut?
- Try to concentrate.
- Yes, the mustache's gone! - More concentration!
Böckl!
You turned to a colonel!
And I was transferred to Vienna! Really?
Congratulations!
And how did you get it?
Remember the ring the Empress, that was a princess, pledged? Yes, to send a telegram.
I gave this ring back to the Empress in an audience... and she ordered me to be transferred... to stay at the entire disposition of the Empress!
- My dear Elisabeth. - Our Elisabeth!
No, my Elisabeth!
My friend, something awful happened to me.
What was it?
Imagine it, I fell in love with the Empress! - What?
- When she looks at me... my heart blows up... I start trembling.
When she smiles, I feel I could faint!
- Böckl!
- The smile!
That lovely smile!
That's love.
I'll never learn to speak Croatia.
- What will we do now?
- Hungarian class.
Well, I like everything that's Hungarian!
- You too, isn't it?
- I hate everything that's Hungarian.
Ah, yes, you lost your husband in Hungary.
I'm sorry to wake up this so bad recollection.
What are you bringing, baroness?
The Royal Highness Sofia asked me to give this to Your Majesty... the instructions for the ceremonial procedures from the Spain Court... the ones that Your Majesty must study completely.
Nineteen pages?
What does it mean:
The noble women and the ladies are the ones that receive... authorization to come into the Empress facilities. And it's pre notified that these people belong to... twenty-three most traditional families... and two hundred and twenty nine ladies of high level.
Well, I'll see if I can understand this silly thing.
Baroness Bellegarde?
Send Doctor Falk in... just for me to relax my mind.
Were you in session with the Emperor?
Yes, Your Highness!
I can see on your face that is not nice what you have to tell me.
I am afraid that Your Highness will be chocked as much as I am.
No more grammar for today. If Your Majesty allow me... I wanted to tell you about the beauty of Hungary.
It is a pleasure!
Did you bring anymore pictures?
Sure!
Some of Putza... Some of the Hungary plans. with their sheet flock and bull-calf.
This is the Real Palace... that is not used for 354 years.
When will we have a king again... a king that respects the freedom of the Hungary people?
I will do everything I can to help your country.
It is strange... but I feel myself more related to the Hungary land... than to any other country, even I do not know it.
I can see it!
But also the Hungarians that also know you... only through what I write... have for Your Majesty a great respect... because they know that you are their guard angel!
Did you really take the state of siege off and gave amnesty to the Hungarians?
Yes, mother.
The amnesty is for the commander of the rebels, the Baron Andrassy, as well?
Of course it is.
In my country where I am so happy... I do not want to see anybody sad!
But Franz, you can not conduct a nation with your feelings.
We had set that any rebel act... would be punished very hard.
But the peace we conquer through the love.
I can already imagine who put this idea on your mind.
You are right
Sissy!
And I am so grateful to her for that!
I am curious to know if you will be grateful for this.
What is that?
Her diary.
How did you get her diary?
It does not matter!
Listen to this!
I do not want to read it without her permission.
So I will read this poem for you.
"The fresh spring is coming"
"And bring to the trees a green freshing"
"The birds learn the new songs... "
"and the flowers see a gorgeous splendor"
It is very beautiful, mother!
"But is here the home of spring?"
"This so weird and rich?"
"I am in search for my sunny land"
"I am in search for my rest at the beach!"
Must I go on?
I would like you to leave me alone.
I can notice that new habits grew between us.
- Who is next?
- Our representative in Paris.
- Get him in two minutes.
- Yes, Your Majesty!
Hi, Franz!
I'm leaving, but I was missing you.
Do you still love me?
- Neither a little bit!
- Why?
Because you don't care about me during the day.
Come on, me?
You are the one who does that!
You are always behind that desk.
Sometimes I don't remember the way you are. Yes, it's true!
Yes, I am jealous...
Jealous?
Of who?
Of this desk!
My diary?
Yes, my mother brought it.
So she took it off my drawer.
I don't know, but I even touched it.
It would be weird if you had touched it.
My mother just read a very beautiful poem.
Do you miss Bavaria?
- yes, when I am alone.
- Sissy... but now your country is Austria.
But I cannot avoid remind the mountains. My parents and my sisters. Do you understand me?
Yes and no. I do everything to make you happy here.
I thought that you were happy here!
I am, but only when you are with me!
But, you are almost never here.
The correspondent in Paris, Baron Von Hubenr!
Let him in.
We will see each other in dinner. What will you do till there?
I'm going to wait for you!
Maybe I will ride... But before dinner, I need to show you a thing.
So, colonel, this way... do you want to speak with the Empress?
- I think it is not right, what about you?
- Please, I'm here to work.
Do you think I am here for pleasure?
Colonel, so far, you have been a rude military... but here, in the Court, where the good manners prevail... and you should learn them. You will ask for one audience with the Empress... to speak with Her Majesty!
And if she wants to. Or else you should wait till Her Majesty...
Get up. Get up.
Turn yourself...
Your face is not strange for me!
We already saw each other before, Highness!
In Ischl...
I had the pleasure... the honor...
Yes, I remember!
You were the idiot that told the greatest imbecilities!
Me?
Mr. Master of ceremonies, tell the Colonel... that he should not do questions here in the Court.
Of course, Your Highness!
- And you are stepping in my dress.
- Sorry, Your Highness!
So the Royal Highness doesn't keep any bitterness!
Neither me for her!
Here in the Court you should not criticize noble people.
It was not a criticize, it was an affirmation.
In the Court you should not even to affirm... or neither do anything.
For what I see, the things will be difficult.
Where were we?
- There. - No...
- What were we talking about?
- About good manners!
Well, first you should ask for an audience with the Empress...
Second, you should wait for the authorization of the Empress... for the audience.
And third, you should wait to know when the audience with the...
Empress...
- Calm down, it won't happen again.
- No, no, it is the Empress.
I'm glad to know that the Emperor made my wish to have you here.
I would like to say that...
Yes?
I...
So?
What would you like to say?
I forgot.
I know, I want that Your Majesty knows... that I will be your most faithful servant...
That impresses me!
- For God sake!
- What happened, Colonel?
Hurry up, a glass of water!
- Are you all right?
- That smile!
The smile.
What smile?
- The smile!
- My smile?
Yes...
No!
The Empress' smile!
My kitty, did you wake up in a bad mood?
First of all, I am not your kitty... and second, I feel excellent!
- What did you say?
- I feel excellent!
Good!
Good morning, Countess.
I want to know if the Empress have already studied the ceremonial.
Not yet, Your Highness!
She went to ride.
I already knew it!
The horses are more important than everything!
If you want to know, for me they are too!
Now I am going for a walk.
- Good-bye, Sofia.
- See you!
- What is going on?
- Oh, Jesus!
- Good morning, my dear father in law!
- Good morning, Your Majesty!
I knew you were here and I came to see you.
I am glad!
What is up?
Fine!
But you don't need to speak so loud...
- I can hear very well!
- Since when?
Well, I always heard well. But I only hear what I want to hear.
If it is something that I don't want, I turn to a deaf. And then people have to ask several times... and then they give up and I save an answer!
Ouch, you are original!
But Majesty, keep this between us.
- I promise you!
- Great.
- See you!
- See you, Your Majesty!
What are you telling me?
Did the Empress go shopping?
Yes, the Empress have been to street market!
- Who told you that?
- The coachman.
He said that she badly could leave the coach... and the crowd almost tore her dress.
Inadmissible!
Are you already ready?
I am curious to know what you have to show me.
Well... Do you know that we have a new parrot?
- The red one?
- Yes.
- Who gave it?
- Aunt Maria!
I want to know also...
- if you know what day is it today.
- Today?
Thursday.
Well, you must have forgot, after all you have a lot of work to do.
- It's a month that we got married!
- Really?
- One month?
- Yes. A wedding present, I hope you like it.
What nice of you!
I am glad you remembered it.
I found it in a stand in the street market.
Have you been in the street market?
And I almost don't get back home. The people are so nice. They were so happy seeing me that they almost tore my dress.
See!
It is a Wigand paintings!
The castle door, the village entrance.
- Fabulous!
- Everything is so well done.
Like the trees, he painted them so beautifully.
And what is that?
It is the Weil village, in Baden.
And the one what is that?
My wedding present!
So, you didn't forget it?
I could never forget... the way you make me happy each minute!
I am very happy too!
Well... now we should go, we have visitors...
I will come to take this later.
But, what is that?
A beer of Munich... and a pig foot!
This is my surprise, mother.
You are so special, Franz!
I miss that.
Do you want a little beer?
No, I prefer liqueur!
- What about you, my dear father in law?
- What?
- Do you want some beer?
- Of course!
- Franz?
- I'm going to give it a try.
- Your Eminence too?
- My pleasure, Majesty.
Here it is, the majority wants beer!
I am curious to know its taste!
Excellent!
The pig foot is great...
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
It is good!
Not bad!
Franz Karl!
Bravo!
I hope, Franz, this is the unique surprise... and that you don't turn our Viennese Court... into a brewery!
Of course not, mom!
A letter from Sissy.
- What did she write?
- I don't know. I still didn't read it, wait...
"Dear mom and dad... after a long time, I drank beer and I ate pig foot! - "I immediately thought about dad... my missing raises each day!
- That I believe!
Here I have everything, but at the same time, anything".
As she had said, she is arrested in a gold cage!
Was it a luck?
The important thing is that she loves Franz!
And he loves her!
She says...
"Franz turns any wish I have, he carries me in his arms".
Don't drink so much!
You never carry me and you are always complaining.
I think everything is about the destiny. Mine is to drink beer.
Our Sissy destiny is to become the Empress.
But anything happens for nothing... probably she has a mission to accomplish!
What is the next audience?
Count Andrassy!
Get him in.
- Count Julius Andrassy!
- Count Andrassy!
I am glad to receive you.
Get close.
Majesty... my goal after been amnestied... was to come before Your Majesty... to thank what Your Majesty have done for Hungary.
Get up, Count Andrassy.
Who gave you the amnesty was the Emperor. You must thank him.
It is not about the amnesty that I am talking. It is not it that brings the happiness and the life to the ruined families.
I'm talking about a heart that beats for a nation. And I want to thank this love.
I will do everything I can to make Hungary and Austria very close. And give the country back to those that have the right.
But these can be only empty words. To prove my good will... I want to invite you with the Hungarian cortege to the ball.
We will celebrate with our hearts... the union between our countries.
- I am outraged!
- What did you say?
- I am outraged!
- Why?
That Elisabeth has invited our enemy... that traitor, Andrassy!
Come on...
It is not easy to forget that it was a Hungarian... who lifted a dagger against my Franz. And now we can find him unpunished among us!
Highness, count Andrassy requests the honor of being presented to you.
Congratulations.
I won't give my hand to a rebel, even if he has been amnestied.
Royal highness... how can I tell him that?
In German or in Hungarian, whatever!
It's a pity the waltz is gonna be over. I'll have to change you for another one.
The Highness, Franz's mother, offended us in public...
She doesn't recognize our amnesty and she considers us her enemies!
Inadmissible.
I think we must leave the ball!
I agree.
You are the imperial couple guests and not the Emperor's mother guests!
It is all the same!
We don't accept this insult!
- Let us put our ladies together!
- Sure.
I'm sorry.
Majesty, are you going to shake hands with the guests?
Majesty, excuse me, but do you allow me to speak to you?
- What happened?
- The Hungarian guests... got offended with the Royal Highness Sofia... and they want to leave the ball!
The Royal Highness Sofia offended us and...
Andrassy wants us to leave the ball!
Majesty, the abandon of the ball will mean... - a break in the peaceful relationships!
- But how can we avoid it?
- Leave me alone.
- Majesty.
What is going on, Sissy?
You look so pale.
Franz, forgive me, but I will break the ceremonial procedures... but I will do that for you and for your country.
What are you going to do?
This is impossible, Countess!
But it is the expressed wish of the Empress!
Well...
Gentlemen, the royal orders:
"the ladies choose".
"The ladies choose"?
- Was it you that ordered, Franz?
- No, I was me!
Colonel? Tell to Count Andrassy to dance with me.
I am astonished!
Is everybody here?
Yes, but must we have to say good-bye?
No. We must not.
Count Andrassy, the Empress asks your honor in the next dance.
I think this Empress' choice... it more important than her mother-in-law's offense.
We should stay.
Ask the Emperor to dance with you.
It's my pleasure.
May I take you to the Empress?
Please.
Will you be there without saying nothing?
Mother, I don't know reasons that made Sissy... to take this attitude, but I agree with everything that she did!
Majesty, may I have the honor of this dance?
It' my pleasure...
- The ball is over for me! - But why?
My God!
What was it? An attack?
The Empress fainted!
- What does the doctor say?
- We don't know yet.
- He is with her.
- Which would the reason?
For sure one she fell of the horse.
I have been with her all the time. When she went to Prater, you weren't!
It can be appendicitis. She already complained of pains.
The reason of the indisposition... was the irritation with her mother-in-law Sofia.
Will We say to the Emperor that the doctor is still with her?
The Emperor should not be disturbed.
He meets with the correspondent of Russia... and he is taking some serious decisions that should lead us to a war.
- Is the counselor still there? - Yes, Your Highness.
Am I very sick, counselor?
I don't think so, Majesty.
But Your Majesty should quit riding for a while.
It is too bad... but it has to be this way.
- Am I so bad?
- Bad, no, no...
- But what is it?
- Good news!
- No, it cannot be!
- Yes, Majesty!
Mr. Doctor!
Doctor!
It's very good, Doctor!
What does it mean?
Franz, I need to talk to you now.
Just a moment, Excellency.
What is going on, Sissy?
- Franz...
- Yes?
We are going to have a baby!
Sissy!
Is it true?
Is it really true?
- Yes, get me down. - Sissy.
Don't press me!
Don't press me. We should be careful!
- News!
- What is that?
- Something very good!
- What happened?
From Vienna, from Sissy...
- Is she gonna have a baby? !
- Exactly!
Congratulations, grandpa.
Mom!
Mom!
Is it true what Thomas told us?
That Sissy will have a baby in Spring?
He doesn't know to keep a secret!
It is true, soon you will be uncles and aunties.
Bravo!
I will be an uncle!
- And me an aunt!
- Me too?
Everybody will be!
Highness, I want to express my happiness.
I thank you very much, but now bring a champagne, hurry up.
Sure.
It's enough for today. Go to bed!
Thomas!
Please, Thomas, take the the aunts and uncles with you.
Come, children!
Good night.
It will be very good it is a small heir boy!
I would rather a girl like Sissy.
But I think Franz would not!
- I am so happy.
- So do I.
The happiest days of the life are like this... we are happy to see that we are getting old.
I still remember, as if it was yesterday, that wonderful night... when which I got the biggest present that the life gave me:
Sissy.
She was so pretty!
- I was proud of her.
- Me too.
And soon she will be a proud mother!
Is it a boy?
It is a princess!
I am very happy.
You would be happier if it had been a little prince.
- I can't wait to see the baby!
- And I...
Did I hear anything?
My dear, here it is, the little princess.
She is like Sissy. The eyes, the hair...
Max, show her to me too. Max, let me see her.
Wait!
The ears are also like Sissy's ears! The two of them!
Come on, don't drive me crazy!
Show me! Let me take her!
Just a minute!
I need everything again very close!
She is so cute!
Isn't she pretty?
Like Sissy!
- The forehead!
- Forehead?
- What will be name?
- Sissy, of course!
No!
Franz and I already agreed, if it were a boy it would be...
Rudolph and if it were a girl, what I was afraid of, the name would be Sofia!
I hope everybody agree because we didn't choose Ludovika.
Of course not, Ludovika is a bad name!
- Sofia is bad too!
- He is right about that!
- Since when you listen so well?
- Well, it was the labial reading.
Fantastic!
"You niece was baptized with the name of Sofia, Anastacia...
Amalia, Elizabeth, Francisca, Stephanie, Carolina, Maria... "
- All of that?
- Yes!
- Do I need to remind all of them?
- No, just Sofia.
The stork held little Sofia so hard?
- Yes, but she didn't feel anything!
- When the stork brought me...
- I didn't feel either. - I felt.
"In a few days, dad and me will be back.
And I am happy since now because we will be all together".
Great! Till there we are going to play Indian!
Countess?
- Isn't she sweet?
- Charming!
Majesty, the visit to the The children's Home!
I am coming!
The Empress!
- Nurse. Nurse. Nurse.
- Majesty.
- What noisy reception.
- Yes, it's really noisy.
- How old are they?
- It varies a lot, from 2 to 7 months. A girl?
- How much does she weigh?
- Two pounds and a half.
She weights more than mine. But mine is younger.
Is he hungry?
I think he wants milk.
He already had milk, Majesty.
- Yes?
- Already!
- Please, Majesty!
- He is screaming for screaming!
Are you a baby girl?
Yes, no?
But what a blondie.
What about you?
What a nice sleepy.
Is that a nice thumb?
One more baby girl?
- What about you?
What is her name?
- Eva.
She is tired.
It's to bad the Emperor didn't come. He loves kids like me!
Where are you? At your desk for sure.
- How are you here now?
- I went to the Children's Home.
- Did you like it?
- It was great!
So many kids, one more beautiful than the other one!
- Well, well, well!
- That's right!
But anyone was so beautiful like ours!
Of course!
How was the place?
Clean and beautiful. It could be a a little more pleasant!
A little dark, the place needs sun.
- I will do what is necessary for it!
- What about seeing our treasure?
Lets go.
Without noise, maybe she is sleeping!
What happened?
Where is the cradle?
What is going on?
I didn't know that mom was going to make the change today...
I was going to tell you tonight. Mom decided to take care of the... education and formation of our daughter. And to have her in a... bedroom next to her.
And how can she decide a thing like that?
I can take care of my daughter!
I learned with my mom!
- She raised eight children!
- She didn't want to offend you... and I was wrong not telling you before, but with all those... receptions and trips, you won't have time to take care of her.
I will always have time for her!
I don't want anybody to take her from me.
- Nobody will do that!
- No? She already did it!
- Where are you going?
- To take my daughter!
- Where is my daughter?
- In her bedroom. The next door.
You cannot come in, she is already sleeping.
I want that my daughter's bedroom to be changed again... where it was before.
I already told you, you cannot come in. She is sleeping.
I won't wake up her. Get out.
She is under my custody.
- But I am the mother!
- You are still a child... and you should relegate her education to me.
I will never let another person to raise my daughter!
I will educate my daughter my way.
For the last time, let me go.
Be reasonable. Mom just wants the best.
So are you on your mother's side? Against me?
I am seeing the things from a neutral side.
Are you against me to educate the child?
I already explained to you the reasons.
So I already know what I should do.
Sissy, wait!
- Colonel.
- Yes, Majesty.
I'm going to travel. Only you and the Countess Bellegard will go with me.
To your orders, Majesty!
- What is going on?
- Your Highness, I am shocked.
The Empress left.
- To where?
- We don't know.
- Did she say goodbye to the Emperor?
- No, Royal Highness.
Should I inform the Emperor about what happened?
No, I will inform him myself.
I think we didn't acted right. We should have leave the little baby with Sissy.
With a human being that abandons us?
She seems a disqualified bourgeois wife.
I let you know the risks of this marriage.
I ask you to stop with these observations.
Now are you against me too?
It seems that you have forgot that... since I married to Sissy, I am happy.
- Hurry up, a telegram.
- Did you come to Ischl?
Yes, but only very fast. Is there anybody here?
- There is nobody.
- Who is inside three?
Nobody.
Every time you come here, you make a mess!
Mess?
I am here on a state business.
How can we telegraph to an Emperor?
To who?
Don't make so many questions. Telegraph...
"To Your Majesty, Emperor of Austria.
Sir... "
No, no... stop it!
Stop it!
"To the office of the Emperor of Austria".
This way is good.
- You can telegraph.
- You drive me crazy!
Well...
"This has the intention to inform Your Majesty"...
No, no!
It's terrible.
Stop, cut it.
Come on, telegraph once since for all.
What do you want me to telegraph?
The Empress is on the way to... "
"Possenhofen".
Not so loud!
My Sissy!
I am so happy!
It is a pleasure to have you here.
Come, hurry up, the Empress.
But tell me, why didn't you bring the baby?
Well, it is a very long trip.
I see. And Franz, why didn't he come?
He had a lot of work. I almost don't see him.
But I am happy to be here. I feel full of life.
- Where is Papa?
- He went to the forest with the children.
I can't believe you are here.
Let's go in and make yourself comfortable.
Seppl, look who is here.
It's good to be here. And Nene, where is she?
With aunt Maria, in Potsdam.
I can sleep in her bedroom?
- Sleep in yours.
- Do I still have my bedroom?
Well, anything has changed in here. Come on.
It was like this that I imagined the Empress's castle would be.
You are right, everything is the same.
- We even have flowers.
- I always leave them there.
There it is, the last book I read.
I still remember it very well...
- And here are your clothes.
- My dress!
Even the same mess is still here.
You know, my treasure, I left the things the way they were... because when I come into you bedroom, what I do everyday...
I have the feeling that you are still with us.
You have no idea how it's good to feel that somebody loves me.
But, Sissy, everybody loves you, and the most important is Franz!
Doesn't he carry you on his arms?
Yes, he satisfies all my wishes.
Are you living well with the Aunt Sofia?
I asked her to be nice with you.
- We are understanding each other.
- Thank God!
It makes me happy.
It would be terrible for me if it was different.
Now put on your dress...
I want to see you like you were before being an Empress.
The suitcases are already in your bedroom.
Blow it, so they will that we are hungry!
It's Max and the children.
Her father!
I think I heard your father's voice. But where is he?
There he is!
- Dad!
- Sissy!
- Slow down. - Where is the Emperor?
- And what about our niece?
- Did you bring her with you?
- What a nice surprise.
- I'm glad because you are here.
She is with us again!
Did you see how the dress fit her yet?
She doesn't look the Empress of Austria... she looks my little Sissy!
Come with, I will show you something.
Why didn't Sissy bring our niece?
I want to meet her.
She is very small, she can't even can walk.
I would carry her.
Yes, but before you needs to have a good soup. Come on!
All my little birds.
But I free them before I go to Vienna.
They came back. Here they feel good.
- Who feeds them?
- Me, of course.
Do you think I would let anybody else to do that?
Do you know who came back too?
Your deer.
Xavier?
But you weren't here and he ran away again.
What is wrong, Sissy?
You are so different.
It is just your imagination.
I know what you missed... the mountains, the forest, isn't it?
Maybe...
So it was good to come.
Do you want to come with me go the hunt field?
We have eight partridges. But don't sneeze when I shoot. Like you did with Franz.
Did he tell you that?
Yes, then he didn't see the prey anymore.
- I swear I won't do anything.
- That's Ok.
I knew it, she went to Possenhofen!
She will come back soon.
No, I know her. I will have to take her back.
You should not leave in a such critical moment... with so many important decisions to make!
Nothing is more important than Sissy!
I'm going to take her and to give her a scolding.
- Do you know how to catch a partridge?
- Of course.
When it coos, you must approach yourself... get stopped like a statue...
And close your eyes for not scaring it.
I did nothing, I just did like this.
I'll never hunt with you anymore.
Don't get mad, it was so beautiful.
- Let it coo.
- Perfect. Let it go.
Ah, dad, it's very nice to walk with you.
I always remember what you said once...
"When you have problems, go to walk through the forest".
What is wrong?
Dad!
What is that, Sissy?
come on, my daughter. Tell me!
I didn't come here to visit you, actually, I ran away from Vienna.
My God, Sissy!
But why?
I couldn't make it anymore. Aunt Sofia didn't stop to bother me... she even took my daughter away me.
Sissy, you know that I am always on your side... but you could not do such a thing... after all, you are the Empress of Austria.
You should not leave your country.
What did you say to mom about that?
She still doesn't know. She was so happy... that I didn't want to hurt her.
Don't tell her anything, maybe things get better.
Well, if you want this way...
Which is the favorite dish of the princess...
Princess?
! I say, of the Empress?
- Ham-meatballs.
- Meatballs.
I will make them. Nobody makes meatballs better than Your Highness.
Ask to Walpurga to prepare everything.
- Hello, Max!
- Hello.
What's wrong with you?
With me?
Nothing...
There is something. What bug did bite you?
Any bug bit me.
Forget it, be not with that face. Sissy told me.
- What did she tell you?
- What happened to the partridge!
Well, Max, forget it...
Is it another thing?
I know you and I know that there is something else.
There is nothing, only the meatballs that I will eat.
Come on, the meatballs?
Highness, His Majesty, the Emperor of Austria.
The Emperor?
Please, receive him, I need to change myself.
- You were never like that.
- I'll tell you later.
You are very strange today.
Greetings, dear aunt.
I'm so happy!
First Sissy and now you!
I could not come before, but for sure you were waiting for my visit.
No, Sissy said that you were too busy.
Yes, but to solve this situation is much more important.
- What situation?
- Sissy has run away from me.
- She what? - Didn't she tell you?
Not a word.
Why did she run away?
The old same story, she doesn't feel comfortable with my mother. And my mother doesn't treat her the way she should.
But this wasn't the reason for the runaway.
You are right... I see. But tell me, what was the reason that made Sissy to runaway from you?
I agreed that mom should raise the child.
- What?
- It seemed to be the best solution.
- Did you take Sissy's daughter off?
- Yes, we changed the bedroom...
And you think it is weird that she has run away?
She should have cared for the image of the Empire.
It is the last important, when it means to assure that... a mother keeps her daughter.
Any woman would act like this.
Franz, you will never understand that... but believe me, every mother would agree with Sissy.
How did he know? Was it you.
No, it was colonel Böckl. He telegraphed to Vienna.
- So it was that.
- Very well. If he didn't know where you are, he could not follow you.
He recognized the mistake he made.
- You should be kind with him.
- Me? Never! I will put everything that I held so far out.
You will reconquer Sissy if you do not reprehend her.
I'm sorry, but I will tell her everything that...
There she comes.
I am so happy to have you again.
- What about our little one?
- She is doing fine.
- Did she gain weight?
- A half pound.
- Is she liking milk?
I know that I hurt your feeling, I'm very sorry.
Me to.
I was such a fool.
But now everything is gonna be Ok.
- Everything will be the way you want.
Was it you who telegraphed to Vienna?
Because you did it very well.
Because it was almost a heroic action.
A... a... heroic action?
- We will not go back right now.
- What do you mean? You need to know your country...
Karnten, Steiermark!
And for not missing your mountains...
I'm going to show you ours!
- Great.
Do you know where we're going to start from?
- From Tirol! - That's fantastic.
This is too beautiful!
I have never seen something like that before.
So? Is it not too beautiful?
There below, it is the city of Innsbruck!
That big mountain is Habicht!
Will I have to climb the mountain riding this animal?
- It's very tiresome for you.
Any mountain is too high and any way is too narrow!
Do you see that cross?
Pay attention. I'm going to show you something!
- Sissy, no!
You are not wearing boots.
- I don't need boots!
Look out, Majesty!
Look out, Majesty.
She is killing me... pardon me!
That Empress is of killing!
- Franz!
See, deer!
Hell! He going to go up too!
You climb as well as I do!
- Where are the deer?
- There!
Look, so many!
Do you see that?
Amazing!
But now it is winding a lot. That means that...
- there is an Alps flower.
- Where? - On the scarps!
I'm going to take it.
- It's dangerous! Franz!
Look out.
- What is he doing? - He's going to pick the Alps flower.
- Is he still there?
I caught it.
I'm going!
I was afraid for you!
Thank you.
- I think it's coming a storm.
- But the sky is so blue! The weather here changes fast.
See how the clouds are moving. Guide, is there an inn close to here?
Yes, the only problem is that the innkeeper will be sad. If he knew... that Your Majesty would come, he would make a better dinner.
- We won't say who we are.
- We will eat what it has. That's it, Majesty!
We used to stay in places like that when we did long trips.
I used to played the zither.
But not like that.
Thank you. Watch out, he can make a mistake again!
- Did you hear that?
- No. Hey hunter, look at that.
- It smells good!
Is there any ham?
- It is inside.
- What about the dishes? - Eat it in the bowl.
What do you drink?
- A glass of milk. - We don't have it.
The goat didn't come. The idiot is hiding!
The goat didn't come. It went up the hill! That idiot!
And it disappeared. - What else do you have to drink?
- "Red" and "Burned"!
I would like to drink "red", but I don't know what it is!
Don't you understand the language of your people?
What a ashamed. "Red" is red wine, "burned" is dry wine.
- Please, a "red" one.
- And a "burned" one.
- Do you have a gentian?
- I can handle it! Bring it, please.
You will already be assisted.
- So? Are you satisfied?
- Not totally.
- Could we stay here a few days?
- To stay here?
- It would be good.
- There is a hut over there. - You only need to clean it up.
- It's Ok.
We will clean it up. When I was going to with my father we used to stay in huts like that.
- I used to make the breakfast myself.
- I heard that you are a great housekeeper.
That too!
Majesty?
The storm is over.
- Is it over?
- Yes.
- That was so fast. - Look, the rainbow!
- Where?
- There!
Ah, I saw it! Sorry, Majesty, but the guide says we have to go back right now...
- before it gets dark.
- You will go back with him.
We'll stay...
- here for a few days.
- What?
In the middle of nowhere? Get us everything what is necessary. And guarantee that nobody disturb us.
- But here there is no water!
- But here there is the "red" one.
Drink a lot to tolerate the way back.
Cheers, Majesty.
Majesty.
What? Are you crazy?
We are incognito! - No formalities.
- Right.
- So, are you going?
- Yes.
Then good-bye!
Did you hear?
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
I am so happy to stay here, to live like ordinary people!
I'm so happy! And tomorrow we'll wake up very early. It's when the weather gets more beatiful.
I know.
- Come here outside, it snowed!
- Ouch, in the middle of the summer!
- I never saw anything like that!
- I believe you. - Let's make a snow battle.
- The agitate of the clouds.
- It's amazing!
Magnificent.
I always wanted it was like that, far away from the occupations of the... Empire, of the politics! And we do not be the emperor and the empress.
Just a simple housekeeper?
My God, I still have so much work!
- For what is this spit?
- You do like this. It was Thomas... who taught me, the more you spit, the more the boots shine.
- I think we must not tell it to my mom.
- Sure!
It will be our secret.
What happened in our absence?
The news about your departure left agitated all the population of Vienna.
- They are talking about a total... misunderstanding between you and the Royal Highness Sofia. What did you do stop these rumors?
Such rumors will only stop if you present yourself in public... with the two supreme ladies.
You are right.
I think that the things are not doing fine.
We will know it tomorrow in the reception of the Hungarian cortege.
I swore that the Empress would come by herself.
Shut up!
Everything was not but mean rumors and groundless.
- Did you talk to your mother?
- Yes, but without success.
I knew that nothing was gonna change.
She threatened to leave the castle... if she had to abdicate the child's education.
- And what did you say?
- I didn1 t know what to say.
So I will tell you:
she is, but I go, and forever.
Did you forget how we were happy these days?
No, I didn't forget, but I think that our destiny... it is be unhappy... forever.
Is the suitcase already ready?
- Not yet.
- So, hurry up.
- These too? - Yes, and the pink too.
Did you came to Vienna... to give me a lesson?
No, Sofia. I came to talk to you. I came to talk from mother to mother!
Look, Sofia, I didn't forget about our childhood. And nobody knows as well as I do... that you are human being and it was the life and the politics... that turned you in a cold person.
You spent your life fighting for a goal, for a son.
You did everything did for your son to be happy, you even refused the throne.
That's why you should not refuse to give him the biggest thing... a true love of a wife!
Sissy loves your Franz!
And you should be grateful for that.
Am I not right? Ludovika...
Don't think that I don't like Sissy, that I don't know her tastes. And I didn't assume the child's education to harm Sissy.
I assumed it for thinking Sissy is still a child... and the women of our age can educate better.
But a son belongs to the mother! And an empress belongs to the emperor!
Franz will travel for the whole Empire and Sissy needs to follow him... she can't stay here taking care of a child.
But it is possible to conciliate both of them.
Sofia, I ask you...
Be conscious and do not make mistakes!
Sissy, you cannot do it to me. Now I need to put all my forces together and concentrate myself.
Nicolau wants to force me to make a war and I don't want it.
France wants to involve me in a war. I need you, Sissy.
I need your help!
Your advices!
See the Hungarians case!
Your understanding, your affection... were more powerful than all my generals!
Without you, there is no a reconciliation. I won't be crowned the king of Hungary.
You only talk about coronations and wars, but never about our daughter!
You only see me as an empress and never as a mother!
No, Sissy!
You need to know what is more important to your country.
- What is it?
- The General-attached asked to... remind you about the reception of the Hungarian cortege within half hour.
Say that I am already going.
Sissy, get ready soon.
I am not in conditions to receive nobody.
There is no chance!
You know what this reception means?
For me it means nothing.
You are the empress from Austria!
Don't forget it!
Sorry, but it is time.
See you later.
Farewell.
Majesty... the suitcases are ready. When do you intend to leave?
In a little while. Now leave me alone.
I just get knowing that the Empress... won't participate of the reception and she will leave.
It's impossible!
It must be a rumor!
Her ordinance informed me. It seems that there was another... argument between her and the Royal Highness for the child's protection.
I should speak with the empress!
- And how will you do that?
- I'll go to her facilities.
Take me to her facilities.
- But just like that?
- I should take a risk, there are a lot... of things involved.
Sorry to bother you, the count Andrassy is here.
- Is the count here? - Yes.
He asked you for an audience.
Have you informed him that I do not want to receive anybody?
- Yes, but he insists. - Let him in.
The Empress will receive you.
Sorry to disturb you so abruptly. But I just was informed that you won't go to the reception.
- I have my reasons.
- I am sure that your... reasons are plausible. But I ask you to leave them aside.
It's impossible.
Since the generation of Maria Teresa, the Hungarian people are waiting... for a member of the Imperial House, who is trustful... someone the people could live and could die for!
And we are here to speak with that member, our future queen!
Although it is a very hard bale, we ask you to go to the reception.
Count Andrassy, do not insist. I can not go.
- Mother!
- My Sissy.
What should I do?
What should I do?
You should not let your husband down, especially... knowing that he loves you.
You have a duty... be strong and surpass to yourself.
- Is she coming?
- No.
- Baron, is everybody ready?
- Only the Empress is not.
It seems that she won't take part of the reception.
- Any other orders, Majesty? - No.
I'm happy you are here. And I am happy to give you some news that will make you happy.
Mom accepted the idea that the child belongs to the mother.
- Franz!
Is that true?
- Yes, it is!
She even already provided the changing of the child's room.
- Who ordered it?
- The Royal Highness!
Sofia, I don't believe that you did it.
His Majesty, the Emperor!
Her Majesty, the Empress!
I salute the Hungarian people representatives... and I welcome you to Vienna!
Majesty.
The Hungarian people... that I have the honor to speak in their name... express the wish... that Your Majesty attend the coronation.
And at the same date Her Majesty will be crowned the queen of Hungary.
I will correspond to this wish... because it happens to be my wish too.
And I thank God... that gave me a woman... with the sacred gift to... conquer everybody's heart.
Now I ask the Empress, that before the Hungarian people... to answer to your question.
It is with lots of happiness that I accept your wishes and that you take to... the Hungarian people my sincere thanks and my greetings.
I wait anxious for a trip to Hungary!
Friends, from Hungarian regions came... representatives bringing a little bit of ground... to create a hill as a symbol of confidence... in the new queen and that God protects her... and protects our land, the beloved Hungary.
How big is this country!
Big enough to get to the sky.
Till our beloved God.
And you have conquered this huge country! Only with the heart.
What huge flocks of oxen. It's like the Dr. Falk's portraits.
Franz, look at that!
So many geese!
Here comes the Empress! Come on!
Hurry up!
I swear before God Almighty... to protect Hungary from its enemies... if they come from north, south, east or west.
I promise as queen of Hungary... to respect the laws and the duties... that unite me to this people... in name of this union...
I will do my best to make the people happy.
Are you still there, Count Andrassy? Yes, Your Majesty.
- Which way do we go now? - I think this way.
No, I think that way.
I think that we're lost. I'm afraid you're right.
We have to turn around. No, I don't like to be the last one.
Let's rest for a while. As you wish, Your Majesty.
Here you are, Your Majesty.
Thank you.
They'll wonder where we have been. They'll be happy that we've lost our way.
We're usually the first ones.
Count Andrassy, I can't tell you how happy I am in Hungary.
I'm glad, Your Majesty.
Here I finally feel as free as I did in Possenhofen.
In Austria, it would be impossible for me to ride unattended. There would be at least 20 secret police officers hiding behind the trees and bushes, making sure nothing bad happened.
Here, Your Majesty is under my personal protection.
Yes, but it's not only this feeling of freedom that makes the stay in Hungary so nice.
Here I have my child all to myself.
The little one already speaks a few words of Hungarian.
I noticed.
Let's go for a walk.
Your horse jumped magnificently.
Excellent!
Very good!
Did Count Batthyani excuse his absence of the hunt?
- Yes, Your Royal Highness. - And how?
With a polite excuse.
Your Majesty knows the real reason.
No, I don't know.
The father of Count Batthyani was executed with 13 other generals after the suppression of the rebellion.
That is why Countess Batthyani made her son take an oath never to speak to the emperor and to refuse to show him any kind of respect.
Did he also take an oath to stay away from his queen?
Certainly not.
But he is hardheaded and disloyal.
Moreover, he symbolizes a very strong power.
He is the head of the strongest party of resistance in the country.
That's why I want to speak with him. There must be a way to come to an understanding.
Your Royal Highness already sees that he even disregards the invitation of his queen.
Then invite him to your castle, Count Andrassy.
I will meet him on neutral ground.
Your Majesty would honor me by being a guest in my castle?
I am looking forward to it, but please keep it informal.
I had my fill of rigid festivities in Austria.
I have heard that the Hungarians can celebrate better than any other nation.
Yes, but when Hungarians celebrate, it mostly ends up in a so-called "Mulatschak."
- How do you say it?
- Mulatschak.
But that is nothing for Your Majesty.
I beg you, Sir, let me read your hand.
Please, Sir.
- Aren't you curious?
- Very much so.
But I fear it could be unpleasant news and, as a result, destroy all of my hope.
Then she shall tell me the future.
What do you read in my hand?
You will have two more children, Madam.
Girls?
First a boy and then a girl.
And you will always be healthy and happy.
Give her a gold coin for the good news. I don't have any money with me.
And give the children something, too.
Poor lady.
I would not want to trade places with her.
Do you believe in the prophecies of gypsies?
I would not be Hungarian if I did not believe in them.
Gypsies have a sixth sense.
Sometimes they know more than we do.
Yes, that's what I have heard, as well.
That woman is crying for help!
I wouldn't take it too seriously.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
But we need to do something!
But it doesn't mean anything.
Why are you hitting that woman?
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty!
What have you done?
Don't you see? It's the queen!
Your Majesty, I am inconsolable.
Your Majesty.
Don't worry. I'm not going back.
Exactly, let's let the gypsies have their domestic peace.
Yes, if she loves her husband so much that she defends him after such a beating, he might as well keep beating her.
But Your Majesty is still warm from the hunt.
I am afraid Your Majesty might catch a cold.
Hopefully not.
I am lucky that the emperor doesn't see me in these clothes.
You are so serious, Mama. Are you worried?
Yes, Franz.
I am very unhappy.
Obviously I am doomed by fate to always play the role of the mean mother-in-law and tell the people I love only unpleasant things.
What is it this time, Mama? You see?
You also ask, "What is it this time?"
And it's true. I have to tell you something unpleasant again.
I do not think that it is right that the Empress of Austria is passing weeks alone in Hungary and does not bother with her husband or her country.
But, Mama, Sissi is also Queen of Hungary. Do you also consider it appropriate that she surrounds herself with a circle of revolutionaries and even tries to start a friendship with Count Batthyani?
A man who offended you publicly.
I think it is mean to talk about obedience when Count Batthyani took an oath for his mother.
You always find excuses for everything that Elisabeth does.
I am left with no choice but to tell you what I would have preferred not to voice. I have come upon letters from people of absolute integrity, which all report that Count Andrassy is in love with Elisabeth.
But, Mama!
The two of them go riding together for hours without any company.
He is allowed to appear at the castle without prior announcement, and he sends Elisabeth flowers every day, just as the gentlemen at the theatres usually do when they are having their affairs.
Mother, I beg you to hold off comparisons of this kind.
I love Sissi, and she has my complete trust.
Of course, she is very beautiful and everyone is fascinated with her charm, especially the men. But she is still no Catherine of Russia.
She is the purest being that I know and a person of character.
I beg you, Mama, not to surround the Empress with spies in the future.
So you are not planning on calling her back to Vienna?
By no means, even though I long for her day and night.
Their Majesties the Duchess Ludovika and Princess Helena in Bavaria. Aunt Ludovika?
Ask them in.
She was visiting the Queen of the Saxony with Nene and has written to me that they are going to visit us for a few days.
That's a pleasure.
Dear Aunt Ludovika.
I am especially pleased to welcome you here to Vienna.
The pleasure is all ours, Franz.
Sophie!
Nene.
Welcome, my dear.
How nice that you made a detour through Vienna.
But of course! We haven't seen each other in a long time.
Since your wedding.
Where is Sissi?
She is not in Vienna.
Not in Vienna?
Oh, that's a pity!
Well, my dear, if you want to visit the Empress of Austria, you have to go to Hungary.
There it is!
Take the doll with you, but come quickly.
Sweetheart!
Mama!
- How are you doing, my sweetheart? - Good.
And you look so pretty!
And Mama hasn't seen you for so long.
Hello, Baroness.
- What have you played with? - With the doll.
- With which one?
- This one.
With the big one?
Come, let's go play with her. The big one, yes?
- Nene has become very pretty. - Yes.
Why hasn't she found a husband yet?
That's something that I, her mother, don't even know.
She passes out only rejections.
When one was once so close to becoming the Empress of Austria, it is not really difficult to understand.
Did she not have any inhibitions about seeing Franz Joseph again? Yes, certainly.
But I had to pass by Vienna. I have something very important to discuss with you.
I hope nothing unpleasant.
Well, it is not exactly pleasant.
That's what I thought.
So, what has happened?
Well, it is terrible!
Ludwig, our oldest, has set his mind on marrying the actress Henriette Mendel.
Has he lost his mind?
The Emperor of Austria is to become the brother-in-law of an actress?
That is unimaginable!
He has completely distanced himself from us and lives in his college apartment in Munich.
Something must be done!
That's why I am here to counsel with you, Sophie.
Moreover, I have told Max that he needs to go over there and talk sense into him.
Ludwig.
I will not leave here until you have promised me that you will not marry Henriette Mendel.
If that is all, then it is easy for me to do. Namely, I cannot marry her anymore.
No?
Because we are already married to each other.
Ludwig, don't make any jokes.
I am completely serious.
We were married secretly two years ago.
And you didn't tell us a word!
- Nene knew about it.
- Nene knew about it?
One is absolutely betrayed and lost with one's own children!
Papa.
- Oh, pardon me.
- No, no, stay here.
May I present to you, my dear Father, my wife and my daughter?
I am speechless.
I can imagine, Your Majesty. You see?
This is your grandfather, whom I've told you so much about.
Look at him.
Well, there he is with a child and a wife, for God's sake!
- Well, what is her name?
- Mariechen.
Well, come here, all of you.
- Mariechen, yes?
- Papa.
Cute little thing.
But how are we going to explain this to your mother?
That's on you, Papa!
Of course, I have to do it.
I don't care if you marry a Mendel, Mondel, or Mandel.
Excuse me. Marry a "bourgeois." That's what I wanted to say. But you know the relatives.
You should have at least thought about Sissi, since she is the Empress of Austria.
But Sissi is just like you.
Well...
My dear Sissi!
I hope that you are having a nice time in Hungary, but considering how long you've been gone, could you return to Vienna for a few weeks?
The Viennese can be very jealous!
And me, too!
I bought this one in Vienna.
Charming, Your Majesty.
The Duke Max in Bavaria.
That's impossible! Why?
With me, everything is possible.
Papa, what a surprise!
In our family one should be used to surprises.
- Gretchen, please inform Mama.
- Gladly, Your Majesty.
Now tell me, Papa, what are you doing in Vienna?
That's my secret.
- You keep secrets from me, as well.
- Me?
You did not tell me that Ludwig is married and has a child.
Because I gave him my word not to say anything.
Yes, and now I must figure out a way to tell Mother.
If I only...
Well, Max!
Hello, Vicki.
Has something happened? No.
What should have happened?
Because you are suddenly in Vienna.
That doesn't mean that something has happened.
I just missed you.
But you didn't even know that we're here.
I didn't know, but I thought that you were here.
So I said, "You know what? Let's meet them halfway."
To whom did you say that?
To myself. I always like to talk to myself.
Max, I know you're up to something.
But, no. What should I be up to?
What do you want? Aren't you happy that I'm here?
Of course, we are very happy!
Listen, Papi, today is a ball in my honor.
That means I have to put on my tight uniform.
Please do it for me.
It will still fit.
Now tell me, did you speak with Ludwig?
- Of course, I have spoken to him.
- And? Did you get through to him?
No. That means, yes. Actually, that means, no.
- Which one is it?
- Well, actually, yes.
He told me, "I promise I won't marry Miss Mendel because I cannot marry her anymore."
- That's what he said? - Yes.
Well, then everything is fine!
Yes, I think so.
That is marvelous!
Where is Sissi?
I haven't said hello to her yet.
Then you must go to Hungary.
- What? - Yes.
- Sissi isn't in Vienna?
- Unfortunately not.
Well, does Mami get a coffee now?
Please.
There. Pour some for Mami.
Thank you. A little milk.
There's the milk.
Good. Thank you.
And now some sugar, as well.
Yes, thank you very much.
That's good coffee!
Wonderful!
The coffee is wonderful.
It was very good coffee.
May I remind Your Majesty...
Thank you... Yes?
...that today is the party at Count Andrassy's castle?
Yes, I'll be right there.
Sweetheart, now give me a nice kiss.
That was nothing!
One more!
One more time!
A real big one!
Thank you very much.
- Tomorrow we'll play again, yes? - Yes.
Say good-bye.
Good-bye.
I am really looking forward to this evening.
I've asked Count Andrassy to organize a real Hungarian evening.
But he says it's not the right thing for me.
He has told me that Hungarian parties always end with a...
How do you call it?
With a...
Mulatschak. Do you know what a Mulatschak is?
No, Your Majesty.
But maybe Major Böckl does.
- Why Major Böckl?
- He studies Hungarian day and night.
He is in love with the daughter of the caretaker, the little Margit.
He is always in love.
- Tell him to come. - Yes, Your Majesty.
Speak German.
They don't all need to know what we are talking about.
What exactly is happening here?
- Why?
- It's a surprise for you.
- A surprise for me?
- Yes, today is your birthenday.
- What is today?
- Your birthenday, isn't it?
"Birthday." It's called "birthday." How do you call it?
"Birthenday."
"Birthenday..."
That is sweet of you. Was this your idea?
Well, yes. But you don't really deserve it.
- Why don't I deserve it?
- No, no, no.
Say, do you still love me?
Sure, Margit, I love you very much.
Then you swear that you don't love other woman.
No, unfortunately I cannot swear to that.
- I see.
- No, you don't.
The woman I love, I mean, the other woman, is no threat to you.
I only love her in my fantasies.
- So I was right.
- What do you mean, you were right?
- I know who this other woman is.
- You know which woman?
- Illunka told me.
- Illunka told you that?
Yes, she heard it from the chambermaid.
What does a chambermaid know?
- You are in love with the queen!
- Are you crazy?
What if somebody hears you?
Yes, but it's true.
Of course!
Well, nothing is true!
I admire the queen. I adore her.
- But you love me!
- Good God!
Please, stop.
- Major.
- Yes, Countess. Her Majesty wants to see you right away.
- To Her Majesty?
- Yes, but quickly.
- Margit.
- Go away, you double-faced man!
Excuse me. Where did I put my helmet?
My sword?
- Well, where did you put them?
- You came without your sword.
Oh, I think I know!
I left them outside!
At your command, Your Majesty.
Major Böckl to the fore.
Major, do you know what a "Mulatschak" is?
- At your command, Majesty.
- So what does it mean?
Well, it is difficult to explain, Your Majesty.
Mulatschak...
Mulatschak is the name for a period of time, for a couple of hours, when every Hungarian thinks he is in heaven and all angels are gypsies.
Have you ever participated in a Mulatschak?
At your command, Your Majesty. I have attended several.
And?
Your Majesty, in these hours I was Hungarian myself, and in heaven.
And the Count wants to deprive me of such a thing.
Thank you, Major. You may leave now.
Yes, Your Majesty.
- What is wrong?
- Nothing with me.
He has my parrot.
I mean, my glove, the parrot.
Her Majesty's carriage has just arrived in the park.
Good, thank you.
Dear friends.
I have promised you a big surprise for this evening.
But I don't want to take you unaware.
That's thoughtful of you.
I have the great honor to inform you that I am expecting a very important guest.
Who?
Her Majesty the Queen will be here.
Thanks for telling us. Just enough time left for us to leave your house.
You can't do that.
That would be an affront impossible to explain.
Under no circumstances will I remain here.
And I think Czaky and Paralfi will agree with me.
We're leaving.
But I'm begging you!
Her Majesty, the Queen.
I am very pleased to be invited to your beautiful castle, Count Andrassy.
I am happy to welcome Your Majesty in my modest home.
May I introduce a few of my guests to Your Majesty, who did not yet get the honor to be introduced to Your Majesty?
Count Czaky.
Count Paralfi.
Count Batthyani.
Count Batthyani, I am pleased to finally make your acquaintance.
And now that we shook hands with each other, I hope that we can become friends.
May I ask Your Majesty to the table?
Yes, gladly.
What should we do?
Naturally, we have to stay now.
Franz-Karl, I urgently have to talk to you.
What is it?
Has something happened?
What happened?
Nothing happened.
If only we could still dance with them.
That would be great.
- A little break from dancing?
- We are going to the park.
The moonlight is so magnificent.
- The moonlight.
- Yes, yes.
My hearing gets better every day.
Yes, I've noticed.
- I need to catch some fresh air.
- Yes.
Franz Joseph is in an especially good mood today.
Nene too. I haven't seen her this happy in a long time.
What is it?
- Will we be undisturbed here?
- Yes, yes, I think so.
- I have a big favor to ask you.
- Yes, go ahead.
It's the reason why I came to Vienna.
I was wondering if you could talk to Franz Josef and ask him to ennoble a young actress.
Well, bravo!
Your girlfriend.
You are a rogue.
But no. What are you thinking?
It's regarding the young lady that my Ludwig secretly married.
- He secretly!
- Hush.
- What is her name?
- Mendel.
Meindl, like the Julius?
Mendel, Mendel!
I see.
Maybe he can at least make her a Baroness or something like that.
Yes, I'll take care of it.
- Yes?
- Yes.
What kind of name shall we give her?
Anything that sounds nice.
In return you may shoot a deer in my forest.
I don't care much for shooting.
I prefer to go fishing.
I recently caught...
- A fish. - A fish, yes. A Waller.
This big, in Wallersee.
Wallersee.
That would be a nice name for Mendel.
Yes, all right, let's name her Wallersee.
This big was the... Was the...
- Fish. - Fish.
It's beautiful here, Franz.
The ball is magnificent, too.
And you are its queen. Everyone admires you. I do, too.
Tell me, Nene, how come you're not married yet?
Why do you, of all people, ask me that question?
Because I wonder.
You look enchanting, and I'm sure you had lots of opportunities to get married.
Nene.
What's wrong?
Did I hurt your feelings?
Not today.
I apologize. It was clumsy of me to ask this question.
But I didn't know it affected you so much back then.
I thought it was a combination of our mothers who wanted to marry us without asking us.
Well, it was.
When I came with Mama to Ischl to be engaged to you, I did not know more about you than that you were handsome and that you were the Emperor of Austria.
But then I saw you and got to know you better, and I felt that I could be happy with you. Nene.
You have no idea how unhappy I was when I realized that you loved Sissi and not me.
I thought that I would not be able to live anymore.
The only thing I knew was that everything fell apart inside of me.
I know that I'm not really supposed to tell you all this.
I didn't want to tell you, either. Never.
I will never love another man the way I have loved you.
Farewell, Franz.
Batthyani is completely enchanted by Her Majesty.
Who isn't charmed by her?
My dear Count Batthyani, I don't want to discuss politics with you. I don't know anything about it.
No, Your Majesty.
The differences dividing our countries cannot be bridged.
In my opinion, insurmountable differences do not exist.
I simply love my country.
So do I.
And the Emperor wants to and will do everything to give your beautiful country true peace.
True peace!
What is that?
Order, peace, happiness, contentment.
Exactly what you and your supporters strive for.
Have a little bit of faith in your King and your Queen.
Or do you think you're unable to do so?
Since I have come to know Your Majesty, I almost believe that I could have faith.
That's nice, Count Batthyani.
And now I know that everything is going to be all right. Where there is a will, there is also a way.
Excuse me, please.
May I ask Your Majesty to open the Palledance with me and thereby crown my ball?
Yes, my pleasure.
Finally there's a genuine human being in this lmperial House.
Your Majesty!
Is Your Majesty feeling dizzy?
No, no. It's only this...
This stupid feeling.
Is Your Majesty in pain?
Yes, since the last hunt.
Your Majesty did catch a cold.
Maybe.
It's already...
There she is!
Let's get some fresh air, yes?
Yes, Your Majesty.
- Where is Her Majesty?
- I don't know. She was just here.
I am glad that you Majesty recovered so quickly.
It's already much better.
Maybe it was the Duhgeier that got to my head.
Yes, that is possible.
It is too fiery.
A very old vintage.
What will you think of your Queen now?
The same thing I always think.
That she is the most beautiful and charming woman I know. And that's...
Why don't you continue?
I am not allowed to, Your Majesty.
You wanted to say, "And she is a little tipsy."
Isn't that right?
No, Your Majesty.
Then I wish that you speak. What did you want to say?
That I am undyingly in love with My Queen.
But, Count Andrassy!
I have loved Your Majesty from the first moment I faced Your Majesty.
I would never have said it but Your Majesty ordered me to.
Count Andrassy.
You know how much I appreciate you and how grateful I am. You have brought Hungary to the Emperor.
Through your strengths and your wisdom, you have turned the hatred of a nation that lasted for decades into love.
You were my only friend.
The only one I counted on.
I would be unhappy if I lost you as a friend and adviser.
Promise me that it won't be the case.
I promise, Your Majesty.
Promise me that you will forget everything you have just told me.
Everything.
I can't do that.
I can't do that, Your Majesty.
I am helpless.
I don't know a way out.
Then I will have to find one.
Please, stand up, Count Andrassy and take me back to the party.
Major. - Major.
- Yes?
Gretchen will be happy that you came to my birthday party, too.
May I ask for a dance?
I don't have time.
I just came to tell you that we are leaving tomorrow morning. - Where are we going?
- To Vienna.
For a long time?
I don't know.
I have to go back to prepare for departure.
What a disaster!
Why are you so sad?
Because I have sad news. Come sit down.
- We are leaving. - When?
Tomorrow morning.
When are you coming back?
I have no idea.
Don't cry.
Otherwise, I'll cry, too.
- You are going to forget me.
- Never.
As soon as you're gone, you will forget me.
And he's playing such a sad melody on top of everything.
Please stop.
Tell me, Countess, do you like Gödöllo, as well?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I never would have thought that it would be so difficult to say good-bye.
It is not good-bye forever, Your Majesty.
No.
But for a very long time.
Mami.
Make sure that the horses are exchanged as quickly as possible. Yes, Your Majesty.
Will Your Majesty use the opportunity to have a little snack?
- Yes, just a glass of milk.
- At your command, Your Majesty.
Come, my child. Come on.
You will get something to drink, too.
- Are you the innkeeper? - Yes. - Where is your guestroom?
- Over there. - Is it empty?
- No, one guest is in there.
He has to leave immediately.
Bring a glass of milk. A glass of milk, as you please.
Your Majesty, one guest is still present, but I will make sure that he'll disappear right away.
Sir, will you please leave the room as soon as possible? Aren't you listening?
You have to leave.
Your Majesty!
- Franz! - Sissi!
How did you get here? I was on my way to Gödöllo to pick you up.
Why? Did something happen?
No.
I wanted to see you.
And I wanted to see you.
My angel!
She looks magnificent. Yes, she has recovered well.
Major?
Your Majesty?
Please take the little one outside to get some sun.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, may I carry you in my arms?
- Well, the milk.
Out of the way!
Out of the way, please.
Did you work a lot?
Yes, the political situation is not very pleasant at the moment. You look very tired.
Most likely because I didn't sleep last night.
We had a grand ball for Nene. Nene is in Vienna?
Yes.
I left right after the ball.
Is Mama there, too? Yes, and Papi, too.
Papili, too.
I'm looking forward to seeing them. I don't think you will be able to see them.
They left this morning. Oh, that's a pity.
But now tell me about you.
You look exhausted, too.
Yes, I didn't sleep last night either.
I left right after Andrassy's ball. You were at Andrassy's?
- At his house?
I wanted to meet Batthyani.
We have spoken to each other, and I think that we have found a new friend.
- How does Nene look? - Very pretty.
Is she finally going to marry this...
I don't know. They've been engaged for nearly two years.
Please don't leave me alone anymore.
Stay with me.
Please don't go back to Gödöllo right away.
No, I said good-bye to Gödöllo for quite a long time.
But I also have a favor to ask of you.
Make a little bit more time for me.
I promise you I will.
Now you do, yes, but when we are back in Vienna, everything will be forgotten.
We are not going back to Vienna. Nor are we going to Gödöllo. We are going to Ischl.
Just the two of us?
We are going to hide out for a few weeks.
- And they're ours, exclusively. - How nice.
They smell great.
Of course they smell great.
- Whose child is that? - I don't know, Mama.
That's odd.
How does a strange child get in here?
Mama has seen the child already. Little one!
You, little girl!
Who do you belong to?
What are you doing here?
Where is your Mami?
Where is she?
Well, where?
Now go and get the two.
Come, we're going to look for your Mama. We're going to look for her.
Max, look.
There is a strange child walking alone in the garden.
- Do you know whose it is?
- Well, it must belong to somebody.
Yes, well... But I don't see anybody.
Let's go.
- Did Mama see the child already?
- Of course. Papa and I have planned it very well.
My heart is pounding.
Don't be afraid. Everything will be all right.
Who do you belong to?
What's your name?
Well, she can't speak yet.
- But she is cute.
- Yes, very. A dear little girl.
What would you like?
A glass of milk?
Maybe rather a beer?
Oh, come now, Max.
You're crazy.
A beer for such a little child.
Look, this is something for you. There you go.
She's hungry.
Do you like it?
Oh, she is such a sweetheart.
Max, a child of this age is truly missing here. Yes, all our own are already too grown up. A mother has nothing left to do.
You probably just want to keep it.
Yes, I would.
But I don't think that the parents would give her away.
I don't think so, either.
Ludwig!
Papa gave us permission to visit you.
My wife, Henriette, me, and Mariechen.
Your wife? You're married? And this is your child?
Our child.
And you knew all about it?
Calm down. Franz knows about it, too.
That's why I was in Vienna. He has ennobled her. She is now Baroness Attersee.
What am I saying, Attersee?
Wallersee. There are no Waller in Attersee.
I did it all by myself.
Well, I am speechless. You mustn't be, because it's your turn to talk now.
Well... If God has given two people something as dear as this child, then He wants to say through it that they belong together.
Welcome, Henriette.
Vickerl, I didn't expect anything less of you.
Sissi.
Do you already have more than I do?
No.
Then I have won!
I surrender.
Catch me!
Sissi!
Sissi, for Heaven's sake, what is wrong with you?
I don't know.
I had it...
I had it several times in Hungary.
But maybe I just ran down the hill too fast.
I'll take you home, all right?
No. It's already better.
I will send for Dr. Seeburger in Vienna right away.
Or better yet, we'll travel as fast as possible to Vienna.
Come.
Are the doctors still with Her Majesty?
No, Your Majesty, but the council is not over yet.
Then please tell Dr. Seeburger that I expect his report right after the council.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
The relations between Austria and Italy are momentarily not the best, Your Majesty.
That is why everything that could make matters worse must be avoided, especially since Austria has been completely isolated since the last war.
I believe this is also the opinion of Your Majesty.
Yes, certainly, Excellency.
Please ask again about the well-being of Her Majesty.
Certainly, Your Majesty.
I'm sorry, Excellency, that I couldn't follow your report as well as I would have liked to.
I certainly agree with you that everything has to be done to avoid another war.
Why doesn't anybody want to tell me what is wrong with me?
Because the doctors are not sure yet, but I'm sure it's nothing serious, Your Majesty.
Why, then, has Dr. Seeburger summoned a council of four professors?
Your Majesty should not worry too much about that.
I can feel it myself, something is wrong with me.
Always this strange pain in the same spot?
Her Majesty's condition is very bad.
The heart?
The lungs.
For Heaven's sake!
But it's only an acute affection, or...?
Is it contagious?
It is my duty to tell Your Imperial Highness the truth.
The professors demand an immediate change of climate but even then there's very little hope for a full recovery.
Her Majesty, of course, knows nothing about this.
How shall I give the Emperor these dreadful news?
He must know the truth.
And the parents of the Empress must be informed, too.
For the first time in my life I am helpless.
Come, go to Mathilde. Get the ball, Mariechen.
Get the ball!
Get it!
Get the ball! - Good evening, Your Majesty.
- Good evening.
- I have a letter from Vienna.
- A letter from Vienna?
That's great!
Thank you. A letter from Aunt Sophie!
- Yes?
- Yes.
Mariechen, throw it here!
Throw it to me, Mariechen!
- Mariechen!
Get it.
- But that's impossible!
Max!
Max!
- What is it?
- Max!
What's wrong with Mama? I think she's got bad news.
What a terrible misfortune!
Sissi is very sick.
Sissi?
Oh, my God!
Isn't that horrible, Max?
Where is the little one?
I have informed the chambermaid that Your Majesty wants to see the princess.
- Pardon me, Doctor.
- Yes? Pardon me.
How is Majesty doing? - Unfortunately, not well.
- Horrible.
Hello, Doctor.
I am on my way to the Emperor to tell him the truth. A difficult task, Your Majesty.
God knows it is.
I will allow Her Majesty to get out of bed today for at least an hour.
I am afraid that a terrible depression could come on top of everything, which would make the condition of the poor patient worse.
Do what you think is best, Doctor.
Poor thing.
Where are you going?
Her Majesty wanted to see Her Royal Highness.
Bring the princess back to her room and wait for further instructions.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- I want to see Mami.
Another time, my child. Mami is sleeping now.
Mami.
I am really allowed to get up, Doctor?
Yes, Your Majesty.
But only for an hour. I'd like to surprise the Emperor.
He will be very happy to see that I am healthy again.
I am sure, Your Majesty.
Countess, can you please bring me my dressing gown?
And tell Major Böckl to let the guards tread off.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Major, Her Majesty wishes that the guards in the corridor tread off.
Certainly. Guards, tread off.
March!
I still feel a little weak, but I think that's from lying down for so long.
Are you bringing news from Sissi, Mama?
Yes. We will speak later.
Is she feeling better?
My dear Franz, I have been fighting with myself for several days now because I have to tell you something very sad, and I don't know how to tell you best.
What's going on, Mama?
Come, sit down beside me.
You may leave me alone now, Countess. Nothing is going to happen to me.
Sissi is very, very sick.
And the doctors are afraid...
What are they afraid of?
They are afraid...
Well, you have to finally know the truth.
The doctors are afraid that Sissi can't be saved.
That's impossible.
What is wrong with her, for Heaven's sake?
Sissi has a lung disease.
And the doctors think that she should immediately be moved to another climate, because it would be dangerous to leave her close to you and the child.
I know it is difficult, Franz.
Very difficult. But, as the Emperor, you owe it to your country and your child.
You need to avoid any kind of intimacy with Sissi.
Do you know what you are asking of me, Mama?
I love Sissi more than my life.
I know, Franz.
But nevertheless, you have to consider that every one of her kisses is contagious, and that the child must be protected from her kisses, too.
You also have to consider other things, Franz, even though it appears heartless to talk about it.
The country demands a healthy Empress and healthy children.
And most of all, a healthy heir.
And...
If what the doctors are afraid of should become true that Sissi won't survive this winter, we already have to consider right now who will come into question to become your wife.
I bar you from talking so cruelly, Mama.
Sissi is alive, and with God's help she will become healthy again.
And if the Almighty wants to take the dearest thing I have in this world away from me, then I will never, never ever get married again!
Even if the country does not get a heir.
You have no right to think of yourself, but only of the dynasty and your house.
Don't forget the sacrifices I made to keep the dynasty of Habsburg. I have renounced the throne for you.
You have told me that 100 times already, and I wish you would not have renounced.
I would have saved myself a lot of trouble.
I sure would have been much happier.
So this is how you thank me for everything I've done for you.
I have never longed for becoming Emperor.
I have only done my duty since I became Emperor.
The only happiness in my life was Sissi.
And if she is no more, everything will be meaningless.
Now you have spoken like a good bourgeois, but not like an Emperor.
Sissi.
The doctor has given me permission to get up for an hour.
I wanted to cheer you up and come and visit you.
I didn't even hear you coming in.
I stood in the doorway.
Since?
I mean, how long have you been standing there?
Just long enough to hear everything that I probably had to hear.
But don't worry, Franz.
I will get healthy again.
And if it's God's will, I will also give birth to a healthy heir.
I will go where the doctors send me and do everything they ask me to do. And always remember that I don't want to make you unhappy, because you love me.
Here, please.
Flowers from His Majesty again?
Yes, His Majesty instructed the gardener here to bring Your Majesty the most beautiful flowers every day.
If I only knew what I could do to bring the Emperor joy.
By getting healthy as soon as you can, Your Majesty.
Yes.
If only that was in my power.
We've been here several weeks, and my condition has not become any better.
It takes time, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty must first adapt to the climate.
I think I must rather adapt to the thought to never get healthy again.
But, Your Majesty!
Yes, I am aware of my condition. I know it very well.
What's wrong, Mama?
Oh, Nene. I can get no peace.
I need to see Sissi.
The poor thing is sitting in Madeira and probably thinks about her sickness all day.
Yes, the worst thing in such a condition.
Exactly.
She needs somebody to build her up, to encourage her, to give her a new will to live.
I know for sure that I could help her very much now.
Hello, Doctor. Are you bringing good news?
Is the Empress feeling better?
I am sorry having to disappoint Your Majesty, but the health condition of Her Majesty is unchanged.
It is despairing.
I've heard that Dr. Seeburger has arrived.
I wanted to find out what kind of news he brings.
Bad news.
Still no improvement?
Unfortunately not, Your Majesty.
And to make things worse, a heavy depression has set in, leading to the worst of concerns.
Terrible.
Your Majesty, here is another gift from His Majesty.
It is so sweet how His Majesty spoils me.
Every day, a new gift.
Every day, flowers.
Everything could be so wonderful.
It will be wonderful again, Your Majesty.
I do not believe in prophecies anymore, Countess. A gypsy once told me that I will always be healthy and happy.
Was I ever really happy?
One must not be ungrateful. One must not sin.
I was happy very often in my life.
And sometimes, shadows must come; otherwise, one would not appreciate the sun anymore.
That's right!
Mama?
- Sissilein!
My child!
My sweetheart, my darling.
How are you doing? Mami, how did you get here?
King Ludwig has given me his yacht so that I could visit you.
How nice that you are here! I have missed you so much!
I just didn't want to write you to come because of the long journey.
But, my child, I would have come to you even if you would have been 10 times as far away, because I know that you need me now.
How is Papili?
And Nene?
And the children? Oh, they all would have loved to come, too.
Countess, could you please prepare a room for Her Majesty?
Yes, Your Majesty. Can you please take my things with you?
- Of course, Your Majesty.
- Thank you very much.
You have it very nice here.
A beautiful piece of land, this Madeira. Yes, but I do not really know anything of Madeira yet. I spend the entire day lying here, and all I know is the view out on the ocean.
Yes, that is what I have thought, and that's why I'm here.
I will cheer you up a little now, all right?
You need to distract yourself.
You cannot always meditate.
You need to move a little. Yes, you know, I am always so tired.
Weariness passes, sweetheart.
You'll see.
The first day, we'll only walk a little. The second day, a little more.
And then you won't think about your sickness at all anymore.
That is very important.
For example, look at the bourgeois women. They are often sick, too, and meanwhile have to work, and sometimes so much that they completely forget about their sickness.
And all of a sudden, they are healthy again.
Well, maybe you're right. Maybe I have really let myself go a little.
I'm sure. So, from tomorrow on, we will start walking.
First we'll look at the town, and then the entire island.
Over there is France, Portugal, and Spain, far, far away.
See?
Over there. How far Vienna must be.
You see, sweetheart?
Now you can already climb a mountain.
- Yes, with difficulty, but I can.
- Then take a little break.
There are bananas!
I need to get myself one!
Stop, stop!
Slowly, slowly!
We agreed to everything at its due pace.
Excuse me, please.
I have a German-Hungarian dictionary.
No, I mean, I have a German-Hungarian dictionary, and I would like a...
What do you want?
You speak German?
That's wonderful!
- Please, help me. - Gladly.
The man says that he does not want to buy.
But I don't want to sell!
On the contrary!
I have here a German-Hungarian dictionary, and I want to exchange it for a German-Portuguese dictionary.
Oh, I see.
He says that he doesn't have any dictionaries.
Oh, what a pity.
Excuse me, but do you know a language teacher who could teach me Portuguese?
Yes, with me.
With you?
I'm a student. I teach German classes.
- When could we start?
- Whenever you want to.
Right away. In that case, right away, please.
Yes, but where?
Shall I come to you, or do you want to come to me?
We can alternate.
For a start, I would suggest a lesson by the sea.
- What does that mean in German?
- I agree. I knew that.
I understand it. May I, please?
Well, Sissi, what are you dreaming about?
You know, it's is so strange. Everything suddenly seems so beautiful to me.
- Yes? - The garden, the flowers, the ocean.
You see?
Earlier, you didn't notice any of it.
I could stand here for hours and look at the ocean.
I would love to take a long, long trip across the ocean.
You got that from your Papi. He dragged me all over the oceans.
The stronger the waves, the more he enjoyed it.
I was always very sick, but he was reveling in it.
I don't think there is anything more beautiful and exciting than the ocean. I have read so much about Greece now. About Corfu and Athens.
I would love to see it all one day.
Let's go there. Yes, Mami.
We will do that.
My child, I am so happy.
I barely recognize you. Do you know that you haven't spoken about your sickness for weeks now?
Yes, and now you are already making traveling plans.
- You're the best doctor for me.
- Hopefully. Thank you.
No...
- Yes, and now let's get to work.
- Great! - No, no.
Not like this.
- No? How do you say, "I want a drink"?
Good.
And how do you say, "I am going for a walk by the sea today"?
Great!
And how do you say...?
Now it's my turn to ask.
How do you say, "I love you"?
- This is not important.
- Yes, this is very important.
- Yes, it is.
How do you know that?
Ah, that is the sentence that I learn first in each language.
- Major.
- Hold on.
Oh, excuse me, please.
Yes, please?
Excuse me, Major, if I'm disturbing you.
But I was told that I could find you here.
Yes, please. What is it?
You have to come immediately. We are leaving.
- Again?
But where?
- To Greece.
To Greece?
Countess, please, you know that I adore our Empress, but she is driving me insane with her endless fondness of traveling.
But, Major!
As soon as I knew Hungarian, we went to Madeira.
Now that I speak Portuguese, I have to learn Greek.
I am convinced that you will find an equally beautiful teacher in Athens as you found here and in Hungary.
- Do you think so? - I am sure of it.
And now hurry and say good-bye.
Don't be sad.
- That's easy for you to say.
- Good-bye.
How do you say "a pity"?
But I have to leave.
I know.
- Don't be sad.
- No, no.
Isn't this impressive?
Indescribable!
I have such respect for this country and its culture.
Look at these columns!
Wonderful!
The purity of the architecture.
And this wonderful view!
Major, are you as excited as I am?
I am amazed, Your Majesty.
If one considers that all this was built 500 years before Christ's birth...
What kind of artists, what kind of builders must they have been?
Yes, you're right about that.
Another letter from Sissi.
- She writes almost every day now.
- Bravo. What did she write?
I can't believe it!
Do you know where Sissi is?
In Corfu. In Corfu?
What is she doing in Corfu?
"...haven't written before because..."
Read a little louder, please. I want to hear, too.
"I hadn't written to you about my plans to travel to Greece, because I was afraid that you would have not approved out of concern about my health. But the journey did me very well, and I am happy to be here.
But you and the little one should be here as well, of course.
I have found a charming house that I want to buy and decorate with antique Greek art."
- She's already shopping again.
- Bravo! Please write to her that she should decorate a room for me, too.
But not Greek. Comfortable.
Going by the letter, Sissi must feel much better.
It is full of optimism and joy of life.
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, no. But we have to hurry, otherwise we'll miss the boat.
Yes, I know.
I just don't understand where Countess Bellegarde is.
Countess Bellegarde, one moment please.
I have no time. Her Majesty is expecting me.
- I am in a big hurry.
- But it is very important. Dr. Seeburger just arrived. He absolutely wants to examine Her Majesty today.
But that's impossible!
Her Majesty wants to go to Athens. I know. But if you could please inform Her Majesty?
- Yes, yes. I will do that.
- Thank you.
Oh, Major.
"Oh, Major, Major."
It could happen to anyone.
Well, who is that?
Well, who are you, my pretty child?
If I only knew what you're saying.
What is your name?
Alexandra?
Andromache?
Iphigenie?
- Helena. - Helena!
Beautiful Helena!
Ouch!
Oh, that's better. Thank you.
Yes, yes.
You...
Helena. She already understood me. I know Greek.
I'm a genius.
Countess, where have you been?
We've been waiting.
Your Majesty, I apologize for the delay, but Major Böckl just told me that Dr. Seeburger has arrived to examine Your Majesty.
Didn't you tell him that I don't have any time?
We'll miss the boat.
But, Sissi, Dr. Seeburger most likely has the order to report to Vienna. Franz will be worried if he doesn't get any news.
Well, all right, then.
We can take the next boat.
Let's go, Countess.
- I'll wait on the patio.
- Yes, Mama.
Hello, Dr. Seeburger. Did you have a good journey?
Thank you, Your Majesty.
His Majesty has told me to send his best wishes and immediately send report on Your Majesty's condition.
But please keep it short, Doctor. I want to travel to Athens with Mama.
Yes. Your Majesty only has to uncover her back.
Countess, can you open my dress, please?
May I ask Your Majesty to cough?
Strange.
How long has Your Majesty been in Corfu?
Three months. Why?
Incomprehensible.
Has my condition become worse?
On the contrary, Your Majesty.
It is a miracle!
Your Majesty is completely healthy!
No.
Healthy?
Yes. Doctor, could you please listen one more time?
- I want to breathe in one more time.
- Most certainly.
Do you hear anything?
- Nothing.
- Nothing? - Nothing.
- Really?
Nothing?
Doctor!
Doctor! One moment, please!
Mami!
Mama!
Mama!
Mami!
Mami!
Oh, my God, Sissi!
What's wrong with you?
Mami!
My child. For Heaven's sake, what is it?
Are you not feeling well? - Mami.
- What is it?
I am healthy.
- What?
- Yes, I am healthy.
- I am happy. - Oh, my God.
Franz, excuse me, but I need to be the first one to tell you this.
What is it?
A miracle has happened.
Sissi is healthy.
Sissi!
This is the most beautiful day of my life.
I will definitely go and meet her halfway.
I would love to come, too.
May I take the opportunity to express my best wishes for the recovery of Her Majesty?
I thank you, Excellence.
Your Majesty, may I also express my heartfelt wishes for the recovery of Her Majesty?
I cannot tell you how happy I am.
The plan of Your Majesty to travel toward Her Royal Highness is of great political importance.
I wanted to say the same. For example, if the reunion is combined with an official visit to Milan and Vienna, that would be a great move concerning the relations between Austria and Italy.
Even Your Majesty once chose to say that the charm of Her Majesty is of more use to the country than the army with all its generals.
Yes, but Excellence seems to forget that Her Majesty has just recovered from a very grave sickness, and therefore might not be able to cope with the stress of a representative journey.
Certainly, Your Majesty. But the relations between Austria and Italy are at the moment so bad that one must make every sacrifice to better them.
Yes, I must agree with the Minister, my dear Franz.
If you travel towards Elisabeth, the journey must have an official character.
But, Mama!
I know what you want to say, Franz.
Sissi certainly needs time to recover.
But she is also an Empress, and the first duty of an Empress is to do everything possible for the good of the country.
Gentlemen, I am more than shocked.
The Italian population is so anti-Austrian that I believe a visit by the Emperor and the Empress gives reason for serious doubt, and I have invited you to Trieste to discuss which precautions to take as a result of this situation.
Please take a seat.
I believe Your Majesty is looking at it too negatively.
Besides, there is nothing we can do about it now. The visit is announced; therefore, it must happen.
Furthermore, I trust in our beautiful Empress.
She also won over the Hungarians with her charm.
My dear Count Zettor, the Italians are no Hungarians.
Please tell us, Your Majesty, which city shall be the first for the Emperor and the Empress to visit?
Milan will be the first city.
There you go. Nothing can go wrong there, Your Majesty.
We will have a beautiful presentation in the Scala of Milan.
Afterwards, a reception with a good meal, and everything will be just fine.
- Good evening, Mayor.
- Good evening, Excellence.
Tell me, who are these people?
I was just about to announce it to you. They're all servants, maids, cooks, stable boys and butlers.
How is that possible?
The Italian noblemen that were invited by the Governor General have given all of their invitations away.
What an insult! I sent the wife of my doorkeeper.
And I, my cook.
And I, my coachman.
- Carlo will tell us everything.
- Why Carlo? I have told him he has to go to the opera and give us all the details.
That's great!
Do you know, Carlo, that today you are the only Italian nobleman in the Scala?
- I knew that before I came.
- You knew that?
Excellence, I am absolutely shocked!
- What is it now? - The people have something planned.
They want to use the presence of the Emperor and the Empress, and the orchestra's supposed to take part in it.
- Well, what is their plan?
- I could not find out. - Send for the conductor immediately.
- Certainly. - The conductor.
- Right away.
The man is to be immediately arrested and replaced by a reliable person.
Excellence, I would not do that. The musicians might not play at all, then.
What could they have planned?
Maybe they will refuse to play the Austrian anthem when the Emperor and the Empress enter.
But that would be... The people had to promise their masters and mistresses to refuse any kind of respect to the Emperor and Empress.
That's impossible!
Oh, you will see how possible it is.
Excellence, Their Majesties have just arrived.
Thank you.
What is this?
From Verdi, from the opera Nabucco.
That is infamous!
That is treason!
- Arrest the conductor at once!
- At your command.
Stop playing at once!
On the contrary!
We've just started!
- You're under arrest!
- One moment, please.
- Come with me.
- Yes, but first I have to conduct.
This is the Italian aristocracy?
My wonderful husband has sent my maid, my cook and all of our servants to the opera. Now I must do all the work myself.
I've already been to the cellar three times.
Oh, I would have enjoyed going to the opera so much!
But, Beatrice!
Yes, yes. The one time an Emperor comes to Milan, a young Emperor, and I have to sit here.
But you're Italian!
No, I'm not Italian. I am a mixture.
Yes, I was born in Hungary. My mother was Polish. My father was Russian.
Oh, now I broke my nail.
The Empress is applauding?
The Emperor, too.
I did not expect this.
- Should I come with you now?
- Begin the opera.
Certainly.
- Excellence.
- But what is it now?
By command of Her Majesty, the reception is to take place.
What?
With these people?
With these people.
The Empress is of the opinion that only those people that have been officially invited are also present.
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand, either.
Principessa Corinne!
It is a pleasure, my dear Princess, to get to know you. I have heard a lot about you.
Prince de Colona!
Contessa Celine!
I am pleased to see you here, dear Contessa. I have heard a lot about you.
His Excellence, Minister retired, Orlando!
Marquesa de la Forre!
Principe Aldo Bandini!
Good evening, everybody!
- Good evening, Carlo.
- Finally! There he is!
- So, how was it?
- Fantastic!
Don't eat now!
Tell us, what was fantastic?
Well, Mariari sang!
It was splendid!
And the Tuscan!
We are not interested in how the opera was.
- No, what about the Empress?
- Yes. The Empress!
She looked like a dream!
And the dress she wore!
I have never seen anything like it!
And the Emperor?
What did he wear? A uniform, of course.
- And what did he look like?
- Magnificent!
You see? We don't want to know what they were wearing. We want to know whether the Emperor and the Empress left the opera right away when they saw our people.
On the contrary!
They stayed until the end.
- Oh, no!
- They stayed?
What?
The Emperor, too? Of course!
And the reception...
The reception was phenomenal.
- The reception took place?
- Yes. Have our people attended the reception?
- Yes, all of them.
- It's only us who weren't!
And in the end, your servants were as enchanted by the Empress as I was.
Moreover, you will all be mentioned in the paper tomorrow.
What does that mean?
Of course, only those of you who were introduced to the Empress.
Us?
Introduced? But we were all here!
Yes!
Yes, that was a curious story. I don't know whether it was a misunderstanding or a mistake, but all of your people were introduced under your name.
Oh, no!
What? My cook was introduced under my name?
And my doorman's wife was introduced under mine?
Correct!
The Empress was especially gracious.
For example, to your cook she said:
"My dear Princess, I have heard so much about you. I am very happy to finally meet you."
Excuse me?
Now the Empress believes that I look like my cook!
- Darling, it's all the same.
- No, it's not all the same!
Why should she tell the relatives that I grew so big?
I have always had such a slim waist!
But the Emperor was a little surprised by the appearance of the coach driver, who was introduced as Principe Orlando.
That leaves us with only one solution.
We will all go to the next reception and clear up this confusion.
Unfortunately, you won't have the opportunity to do that.
The Emperor and the Empress are leaving Milan tomorrow to go to...
Where?
To Venice.
This ostentatious silence is more crushing than an assault.
You shouldn't be surprised by the attitude of these people.
They know your name only from death penalties that others have passed for you.
Yes, you are right. So many mistakes have been made.
Radetzky was too strict. My brother was too permissive.
That's why I told you not to take this trip.
I wanted to spare you this humiliation.
But the worst is yet to come.
The passage from the Piazetta to St. Marcus' Church.
I wish I could spare you that.
Don't worry about it, Franz.
The journey to Madeira was much more difficult, and I gladly made it for you.
What a wife Heaven has sent me!
That's our child!
That's my surprise for you.
I've got you back!
My sweetheart!
You've grown so much!
Mami will never ever go away again.
Never!
Sissi.
Forgive me, Your Eminence, that I did not greet you first, but I did not know whether I would see my child again in this lifetime, and I was so happy about it.
Blessed are the people whose hearts overflow with joy, because this joy comes from God.
On this morning in 1701, like every morning for nearly 20 years, the Sun King, upon awakening, receives his most favoured courtiers, including Prince Philippe of Gonzague, who was granted the supreme favour of taking part in these morning rituals.
Sir, how did you find the King this morning?
Ever more domineering.
Led by Madame de Maintenon, and like all who are aging, he thinks only about marriage-broking.
And who is to be his next victim?
He wishes my cousin, Philippe de Nevers, to marry one of his nieces.
His Majesty has charged me with informing him of these glad tidings.
Dear Philippe, the King knows what he is doing in giving you his niece's hand.
Are you not one of the most fortunate men in the kingdom?
The most unfortunate.
I don't understand you. Mademoiselle de Savoie is certainly no Venus, but to become the nephew of the King of France...
What an honour!
His Majesty charged me with informing you of this. This has been done.
Do not forget: "What the King desires, God desires."
But what God has brought together, the King cannot separate.
What are you trying to say?
For almost two years, I have been married to Isabelle de Qélus.
You know the enmity that exists between the families of Nevers and Qélus.
We have been forced to keep our love hidden.
We took advantage of her father's absence to be secretly married before God by one of my family's chaplains.
- You married... in secret?
- Yes.
We had hoped His Majesty would help us to declare this fact to the old Marquis, and thus obtain from him his belated consent, a most urgent necessity since a daughter has been born. She is now almost one year old.
Knowing his current disposition, I fear the King will be highly displeased that you married without having consulted him.
Could I have foreseen His Majesty's sudden decision regarding me?
Poor Philippe, for you this decision is as good as an order of exile.
I know.
I promise to help you overcome this difficulty. You can count on me.
Thank you. But what will you tell the King?
That illness requires you to travel to a region more conducive to your health.
The King cares not for the sick, having been unwell himself too often recently.
In a year or two, matters may well have changed. You must leave as soon as possible.
I will remain only long enough to embrace my wife and daughter.
- How to tell Isabelle? - I go tomorrow to Qélus.
You know that the old Marquis trusts me.
I will facilitate the meeting.
Thank you, my faithful friend.
- Your wallet, sir!
- Get back, churl!
The "Nevers strike"!
To remain here would be unwise!
- What are you doing, thief?
- Monsieur Lagardère! - Ah!
It's you, Passepoil! - Yes.
- You're trying to borrow my horse? - No, sir.
I saw ten scoundrels set upon a gentleman down the street...
- So you tried to flee... with my horse.
- Yes, but... only to find help faster. - What's done is done.
Let's go.
- But there are ten, at least... Exactly.
That makes things even. Show me the way.
Jump to it!
- This way...
- To me, you two!
- Thank you, sir! - You jest, my Lord!
You will defeat them single-handedly.
I am merely lessening your work.
If I knew your strike, my Lord, I would dispatch them even quicker.
- I will teach you.
- You are generous, sir.
My Lord, this one was mine!
Go and find my horse.
My Lord, at your service.
As you please, sir.
- Well parried, sir!
- Hold, sirs! Armed men are coming! And with all these gentlemen here...
- We will continue later. - Quickly!
- When it suits you, my Lord.
- Until the next time, sir.
- Look at all this! - What a massacre!
Congratulations, Pérol!
Your hired killers performed wonders.
- I don't understand what happened.
- It seems that someone assisted him.
Whoever he may be, we shall find him.
At Qélus, it will be simple to make both father and child disappear.
I can't believe that you accepted such a job. One has to live.
And the guards are so overworked at the moment...
Those with the means have their own guards.
I am acting honestly when I attack dishonest men. We were told that this lord is involved in a conspiracy. - A conspiracy?
According to what we were told, he would try to assassinate the Prince of Gonzague unless we killed him.
Who was to pay you for this fine work?
Pérol, the Prince of Gonzague's Captain of the Guard.
I want to know who wishes ill towards Nevers.
Tomorrow, see this Pérol and find out.
Don't you realise what will happen to me?
If they discover I've spoken to you...
Fellows like that don't forgive...
If I had some advice for you, Passepoil, it would be to serve me faithfully. - Yes. - If not...
Sir, you have nothing to fear, since you use such convincing arguments...
In short, my Lord, no one knows of the existence of this child. If child and father disappear...
Nevers' inheritance comes to me by law.
You will be the most powerful nobleman in the kingdom.
- After the King.
- For the time being, my Lord.
- Welcome, Monsieur de Gonzague.
- Thank you, my Lord.
It pleases me to see you again, Isabelle.
I have important news to give you.
Do not be so unhappy. I will take care of everything.
Have courage, Isabelle.
Your husband, my cousin, the Duke of Nevers, will arrive tonight.
He will come through the back gate that leads to the moat.
- May God protect us!
- Have courage!
How can we thank you?
You can count on me. I am ready to sacrifice my life for your happiness.
Go to the meeting place and find out what your accomplices are planning. Listen to yourself!
They are no longer my accomplices. I am your servant! - True.
Do as I say!
- And you, my Lord, be careful.
I finally have a good master, so I don't want to lose him!
Father, it is late.
Will you give me permission to retire? Good night, Isabelle.
What most surprised me about Versailles, Monsieur de Pérol, is the immorality which reigns there.
Our principles and traditions are being lost. A Qélus would prefer to kill his daughter by his own hand rather than to let her be dishonoured.
Leave me.
Lady Marthe!
You do not believe that we will be exposing little Aurore to grave danger?
She will never be truly safe except under her father's protection.
But why not confess all to your family?
You are the wife of Philippe de Nevers before God, and Aurore is your child.
My father is the enemy of Nevers.
You know how proud he is. His heart is impervious to all human feeling.
If he were to learn of my secret marriage to Philippe and the birth of Aurore, he would be capable of wreaking the cruellest vengeance upon us both.
Perhaps, with time, matters will change...
Poor child.
Madame, it is late. It will be midnight soon.
Be brave, Isabelle.
Fate cannot be against us forever.
Have courage. We will find happiness when this ordeal is over.
My Lord, you must leave immediately!
Twelve men are heading to the castle to assassinate the Duke of Nevers.
Take her away from the dangers which threaten her in this castle.
There is a piece of paper pinned to her blanket.
It is the page I tore from the chapel register. It is evidence of our union before God, and proves our child's identity.
I shall pray for you.
Farewell, my love.
May God protect you.
My Lord, do you really think a duel is appropriate with the child present?
- You again, sir.
- My Lord. If I may advise you, entrust the child to this nursemaid here.
- You are mad!
- I have followed you from Paris.
You are marked for death. Twelve men are preparing to attack at any moment.
I beseech you.
Go and wait near the horses. And don't move!
Do you hear them?
- Can you hear it, Pérol?
- There is fighting by the moat. Look, my Lord!
Someone is fighting by his side!
Did Nevers suspect something?
Could one of your men have warned him?
Truly, one cannot trust anyone in this day and age.
Come, Pérol. Let us go and observe what happens.
And another!
Come closer! I need a halberd to reach you from here!
Come, Pérol!
My Lord, beware!
Coward!
Ignoble coward!
My Lord...
Assassin! Turn and face me, or I shall strike you in the back!
Hurry, my Lord, this way!
Coward! Whoever you may be, I will recognise you.
I have marked your hand! And when the time comes, if you don't come to Lagardère, Lagardère will come to you!
- My Lord...
What misfortune! - Passepoil, let us carry him.
No use. It is too late.
My Lord, I will avenge you.
My child. Take care of my child.
Take her away from here.
I will watch over her. I swear this to you.
Let me pass!
Madame, great misfortune has overcome us.
Your husband, my dear cousin and best friend Philippe de Nevers, is no more.
He succumbed to a band of ruffians led by a scoundrel called Lagardère.
I spilt my blood defending him, but there were too many of them.
- And my child?
- They took her. Before he died, the Duke entrusted you to my protection.
I swear to do all in my power to return your daughter to you.
Pérol, have our horses saddled and our men armed. Madame, pray for those whose sole wish is to avenge your husband.
Pray that they may be the instruments of a just cause.
Madame, it is monstrous!
- I think we fooled them.
- But I believe they are not far behind.
A chapel! It is the best refuge for this little angel.
- Still nothing?
- Still nothing, Captain.
Damnation, it's not possible!
Are you all asleep? We found tracks at the roadside cross of St Honorine, but then lost them at St Jean farm.
Bunch of fools!
Go back! We will not sleep until we find these child stealers.
The Prince promises 1,000 crowns to the one who finds them, dead or alive!
The tracks seem to lead in this direction.
*THIS CERTIFIES THE BAPTISM OF AURORE DE NEVERS,
*DAUGHTER OF PHILIPPE, DUKE OF NEVERS
* AND ISABELLE DE QÉLUS, HIS WIFE BEFORE GOD
- Look at the tracks.
- They can't be far.
Master, Pérol's men are coming along the river.
They are heading in our direction. Untie the horses.
Go and look inside.
What good luck that I saw them coming.
There's nobody there.
I think we can return now, they have gone.
By order of the King, a reward of 5,000 crowns is offered to whomever assists in the arrest of the Chevalier de Lagardère, who is responsible for the assassination of His Royal Highness, the Duke of Nevers. For this crime he is condemned to be hanged until he is dead.
All provosts are hereby ordered to carry out this sentence immediately notwithstanding any possible reprieve.
- She must be thirsty.
- Then let us stop. Go down to that inn by the roadside and bring back a jug of milk.
- Keep to yourself!
- Yes. Learn what you can about crossing the border.
I will do my best.
Welcome, my Lord.
Come in, my Lord. Here you will find good food, pleasant lodgings and fine wine.
Be seated! I never refuse good wine. But for now, I would prefer a jug of...
I have an excellent rosé from Béarn.
Miss, I would like a jug of milk.
Milk, for you? What do you want with a jug of milk?
- It's for a thirsty child.
Welcome, Captain, and your band of gallant companions!
Hello, you old rogue!
What can I offer you?
We are dying of thirst. Some of your rosé.
Be quick about it.
Two jugs of rosé for these gentlemen! To what do we owe the pleasure of your company?
We seek two bandits attempting to cross the border.
They have stolen a child.
- A child?
- A ten-month-old infant.
- Have you seen anyone suspicious?
- No. We'll catch them soon.
The guards have been doubled.
They'll find it difficult to cross into Spain. Indeed. Two men with a small child in their arms?
- They'll soon be captured.
- I hope so. After all, who will nurse the child?
Men aren't wet nurses!
Get down, you!
Here, the jug of milk for the little one.
I'm dying of thirst. 5,000 crowns for he who brings them back, dead or alive.
5,000 crowns!
They must be dangerous. If we find them, we'll kill them on the spot.
No point in my widow receiving the reward!
You find it amusing that I speak about my widow?
No, sir. Laughter is... infectious.
- To your health, sir!
- To the King!
- Long live the King!
- Good, is it not?
- First-rate!
Where has my customer gone?
Here's his rosé. He drank his rosé.
He even paid for it.
That wasn't wine, that was milk.
He was drinking milk?
- Some still remains.
- He wanted it for a thirsty child.
- Do you know this fellow?
- First time I've seen him.
- Captain!
Look over there!
- That's them!
Passepoil!
Stay right here until I return.
One moment, Sultan.
Wait a moment longer.
There you are!
Yes, here I am! Don't stop, or you are a dead man!
Throw the pistol away.
Stop.
Get down from the horse.
I feel like being generous. Since there is a price on my head, I will give you a chance to claim it.
So, fellow, en garde.
You are acting under orders of the King, so I will spare your life.
Know that I am innocent of the crime of which I am accused. And remember, all my actions have been for honourable reasons.
All fresh and creamy.
Time to feed Miss Aurore!
Up to here it's fine, but then...
I get tangled up. Let me do it, master. I know how, I was the oldest of twelve children.
What's this, then?
A shepherd with his flock of sheep.
Is Spain far from here?
Good, we're in Spain.
What do I feel down there?
What's have you done now? Come now. I swear, that's how life is.
If I had been told that night in Paris when I was hired to attack your father that his daughter would pee down my leg in Spain, how I would have laughed! Well, that's the way it goes...
Five years later, in Paris.
- Was it a pleasant journey, my Lord?
- Excellent.
We made five leagues a day.
Do you bear good news? My trips to Qélus have rarely been joyful.
I've waited patiently for years. The marquis has finally consented to give me his daughter's hand.
Congratulations, my Lord.
And what does Mademoiselle de Qélus think of her father's decision?
She will do me the honour of becoming my wife.
In three months we shall be married.
My Lord, your charm guarantees your success.
No, Pérol, she simply believes that we pursue a common goal.
She has conferred on me her cherished hope, to retrieve her daughter Aurore.
- We must not disappoint her.
- We will not disappoint her, My Lord. According to news I received from Spain, Lagardère and the child are in Segovia.
Four reliable scoundrels who are devoted to our cause are waiting only for you to give the order to depart.
They need wait no longer.
Do what must be done. Pérol, be sure to tell them that they serve a very noble cause.
Even rogues aspire to grand ideals.
- Segovia?
- That way.
- Is it far?
- And what's that?
- "A". - "A".
And that?
- "U". - And that?
- "R". "O", "R", "E".
- And that makes...?
- Aurore!
Very good!
And now you've learnt to read your name, you will learn to write it.
Goodbye, Passepoil. Bring me some oranges.
Yes, as always!
Don't drink too much, and don't talk!
As always.
Let's go!
Come, we have to search the whole market and find anyone who has information about our two fellows.
Hello, sir, would you like some oranges, as usual?
Who's that fellow over there?
- I've seen his face somewhere before.
- You think?
No... Wait, I want to put my mind at rest.
- Who is that man?
- A poor deaf-mute.
I'm still sure I've seen his face before.
Look, he's a local. You can tell straight away.
Wait.
What's going on, then?
Damnation, I spoke!
- That's our fellow!
This way!
No, another one. I don't like this one.
I assure you, this one is very ripe.
- No.
- This one is better.
- Give me another. - But this one is riper...
My friends, I have an idea. Let us untie his donkey.
It will undoubtedly lead us back to its home.
We need merely follow. That way, we will take the other fellow and the child unawares.
- Great idea, chief!
- It's not bad, I'd say.
You, take off the baskets. And you, stay here.
Go back to the market and try to capture him.
Come on, back home. On your way!
Come on, get going!
Look at that!
Accursed donkey!
Is it going to stay there all day?
So much for that idea...
Wait, I'm coming!
Make up your mind, confounded donkey!
There's nothing we can do.
Don't go so far away!
Come back!
You, take care of the child.
Come on!
Aurore, my little Aurore.
Master, there's not a moment to lose!
We must leave immediately!
- Why?
- Don't worry, I concealed my tracks.
But I have a feeling that it won't be long before we have visitors.
You have a feeling...
Finally, we've arrived.
- It's Toledo.
- It's about time.
- Can I help you, sir?
- Señor Don Miguel.
He is here, come in.
- Is this the Duke of Alba's sword?
No, not that one. This one.
Sir, a foreign gentleman has given me this sword to present to you.
Treat this gentleman with the utmost respect. I will come in a moment.
Señor Don Miguel will receive you soon. Follow me.
Welcome.
The guest you see here may bring you more trouble than joy.
The law of my country has accused me of a crime I did not commit.
I have chosen to go into exile.
I do not wish to be a cause of discomfort for you.
- I would understand...
- Consider this your home, Henri.
My home is yours until you are able to avenge these wrongs.
Look!
They have not waited for us to make each other's acquaintance.
That delightful child and my daughter Flore will be raised as sisters.
1 7 1 5.
Too early for some, too late for others.
Louis XIV is no longer on the throne.
The court have abandoned Versailles and returned to the Tuileries palace.
Until the young King Louis XV obtains his majority, the Regent, Duke Philippe d'Orléans, rules in his stead.
The high principles of religion, high birth and service to the state have given way to a mania for living in accordance with the Regency style.
The fashion was for extravagance.
Great lords owned private and secret residences where they entertained intimate friends.
They held suppers where fine foods and heady wines were not the only delicacies available.
In his private residence, the Prince of Gonzague hosted the most refined soirees in all of Paris.
The treasury was empty, but there were many wealthy Frenchmen.
Rich in banknotes, rich in hope.
France knew heady days when state bonds increased their value.
The Prince of Gonzague turned the courtyard of his town house into a veritable banking establishment.
- 1 0,000 louis profit!
- A good day, Pérol.
We will do even better tomorrow, my Lord. Confidence reigns.
What is it?
Her Highness, the Princess of Gonzague, asks if my Lord will receive her.
Yes, inform the Princess that I await her.
Leave me, Pérol. I must let her state her piece yet again.
Your private life is none of my concern, sir.
However, my astonishment at these libels can hardly surprise you.
How fortunate, our Lord Gonzague Who all our gold invests
Beauties open wide their arms And husbands, wide their chests
Slander, naught but slander!
I do not want the name I bear to be a byword for corruption, dishonesty and debauchery.
Cease these activities for which I could be reproached.
Madame, who would dare imply such a thing?
Aurore de Nevers, my daughter.
God willing, I will find her one day.
Alas, Madame...
Could time have caused you to forget your promise, Philippe?
No, Madame.
For more than 1 6 years, we have moved heaven and earth.
- But I fear that to go on hoping...
- Never will I abandon hope.
- How beautiful they are.
- Yes.
What are you thinking, Aurore?
Flore, in truth I am most unhappy.
Henri forbids me from leaving the house or seeing anyone. Except for you. He seems to fear some danger.
- Are these the stirrings of jealousy?
- Jealousy? What madness is this?
Why do you blush so, then?
Tell me softly, do you love him?
- Why softly?
- Loudly, then, if you wish.
- Yes, I love him.
- At last! And him?
He loves me... like a daughter.
- Impossible, he isn't your father.
- I'm not entirely certain.
Passepoil raises his eyes to the heavens when I ask.
- Why don't you ask Henri?
- You think?
If he isn't your father and if he isn't madly in love with you, it's because...
- It's because...?
- It's because he loves another.
Another?
Good morning, Aurore.
You certainly are quiet this morning. What were you discussing with Flore?
- Nothing.
- Truly?
And you? Where were you?
Whom were you with?
Since when do well-bred children pose indiscreet questions to adults?
I don't care about being well-bred!
It is time that you realise that I am no longer a child.
- So she is no longer a child?
- So it would seem.
She is not wrong, Henri. She is now a beautiful young woman.
Is it not now the time that she learn the truth?
About her birth, her family, her mother...
Henri, how happy I am.
- You truly are a child.
- Not at all. Indeed!
It was only a few days ago that you were sad, and wept.
Today you are laughing, and are happy.
Yes, I am happy. You have barely left my side for the past few days.
- That proves to me that...
- What does that prove to you?
- That you do not love another.
- What an idea!
Sit next to me.
Who are you, to have abandoned everything for me?
To have dedicated your life to me since my infancy?
Is there some family secret that prevents you from telling me the truth?
Does some blood tie exist between us?
No, I am merely a friend.
Henry, how happy I am.
Aurore, try to understand.
One night long ago in the ditches around the castle of Qélus, I swore to your dying father, the Duke of Nevers, to punish his murderer and return you to your mother, whose only hope is to see you again one day.
She alone has the power to grant or forbid the feelings in your heart.
Master!
- My dear master!
- What do you want?
- I've been looking for you for hours!
- Why?
Don Miguel has sent me to bring you back immediately.
He has received news from Paris. It seems that strange things are afoot!
A family council, or some such thing.
Make haste!
Be careful, it's fragile.
Here is a list of addresses of friends who can help you along the way.
And my son's papers, which should help you cross the border without trouble.
Thank you, Don Miguel.
Despite the dangers that you face, I approve of your decision to leave. Yes.
It is imperative that we reach Paris before the family council.
I pray you will arrive in time to prevent the worst.
Good luck, Henri.
Put it there.
- Goodbye.
- Farewell, for now.
- No embrace for me?
- Goodbye, my little Aurore.
Thank you from the depth of my heart. Thank you for everything.
Tie it down tightly so that it holds.
- Flore, goodbye.
- Goodbye, Passepoil.
Goodbye, Don Miguel.
Take this.
In Paris, the courtyard of the Gonzague town house has become a playground for speculators.
- Another? - Yes.
- I'm selling 1 00 shares.
- I'll pay market price.
- I'll pay 1 00 more! - Agreed.
My hump brings luck, sir!
Signing a transfer on it guarantees good fortune!
Then come closer, sir, come closer!
Approach, so I can sign my transfers upon your back!
- That will be two livres, sir. - Two livres!
That's steep!
- But your profit is assured!
- We shall see...
His Lordship, the Prince of Gonzague!
It would please me if any hats still on heads are removed!
Your Lordship promised to advise me. Buy!
Buy today in order to sell more dearly tomorrow!
- Good evening, my Lord.
- How are you, hunchback?
Very well, my Lord.
But...
If I am a hunchback, you also are one!
- What insolence is this?
- My Lord, you have a hunch when it comes to business!
I will have to thrash you some day for your impertinence.
My Lord, my hump only brings good luck if you stroke it!
- What's all this fuss, young man?
- They're going to fight over me!
Young man, I demand... Apologise to her.
- My apologies, Madame.
- That's better. Go.
Thank you, Mr Passepoil.
Good manners are a rarity nowadays.
In our day, young people respected ladies of quality. But now...
You will allow me to accompany you?
Perfect. Come in.
Come on, hurry up!
Your hat!
My Lord, here are the gypsies whom I spoke to you about.
They have come to thank you for your leniency.
- Thank you, my Lord.
- May God protect you.
They truly look like false witnesses. You don't think it will be obvious? Quite the contrary.
The fact they look so suspicious will convince the council that we did not chose them ourselves.
So you claim to have proof that the Duke of Nevers' daughter is dead.
We saw her dead body as clearly as we see you.
And what proof do you have of this?
We discovered in the woods one morning a child's body that had been half-eaten by wolves.
It was terrible, terrible, terrible!
If you please!
What led you to believe it was Nevers' daughter?
She wore a small medal around her neck with her name on the back.
"Aurore de Nevers." There was also a date of birth.
- Have you kept this medal?
- No, my Lord.
The medal was made of gold, and we are poor people.
We sold it to buy food.
The child, was she by herself?
No, my Lord. We found the body of a cavalier in a ravine, apparently killed in an accident with a horse.
Very good.
If only all that were true. I feel as though I'm dreaming.
My dear Pérol, ensure that they remain at hand.
Tomorrow, their testimony will convince the family council.
I have no doubt, my Lord.
My dear Pérol, it falls to me to perform a most unhappy task. I must inform the Princess of this dreadful news.
Go.
Madame, I have waited until now to confirm to you the terrible news for which I have been trying to prepare you for several months.
This very moment, I have received incontestable proof that your little Aurore is no more.
- No, it's not possible. It's not true! - I fear so, Madame.
Three witnesses, gallant gypsies, discovered her in a forest.
Tomorrow they will provide proofs of her death to the family council.
It is impossible.
Something within me tells me that she still lives.
The details you would learn about her end would only deepen your grief.
For reasons of affection, I advise you not to attend the ceremony.
Yes. I will obey you, sir.
May the sincerity of my feelings and the assurance of my deep affection be of comfort to you in this ordeal that you are undergoing.
Madame, why are you weeping like this?
God will protect you. You must not despair!
Leave me, I beg of you. Everything is at an end.
- It is all over for me.
- Here is a letter for you.
No, I am no longer interested in such things.
My little Aurore is dead. Leave me.
Her Ladyship, the Princess of Gonzague, care of Lady Marthe
This is all the chicken you have?
You'll find none better, not plumper nor fresher. It was killed this morning.
Hunchback, life goes well?
Come, how do you like this cloak?
Bring your hood forward more. Enemies could be all around.
It seems you resemble your mother somewhat. One never knows...
Good, just what I'm looking for.
How much for a plate?
- Look at the hideous hunchback.
- Goodness, turn away!
- He frightens you? - No.
But turn away. He looks nasty.
Look, he's watching us.
Oh, well... No matter. Come, let's go.
How strange, he lives next door to us.
He's allowed to. Come, don't dwell upon it.
Come in.
I don't like that hunchback.
I've often seen him roaming the streets. One time, he was even looking through our windows!
- You must speak about it to Lagardère.
- Come help me in the kitchen.
The master will complain once more that we are lunching late.
He won't be in a good mood as it is.
- What do you know about that?
- A premonition. Clean these.
- I believe that he's had enough. - You think?
What ideas you have.
He never spends time with me. It is certain, he loves another.
So that is how you see matters, my dear Aurore?
You reveal your youth by talking like that.
What do you know about love, or men?
When we love, we are often too reserved, this is well known.
Even the great seducers.
Take me, for example. God knows that I have had my conquests.
Ah, they say love is blind, but what is sure is that it is often mute.
So, the table is not yet set.
We are not dining today, perhaps?
- What are you doing? Daydreaming?
- Just that, daydreaming.
- Don't be angry, he got home late. - The market was crowded.
- One person too many, I'm sure!
- Yes, a hideous hunchback.
- With a nasty look.
- It gets better!
Aurore, you went out despite my interdiction. Well done, Passepoil.
No, she saw him... out the window. What nonsense am I saying?
- It's not worth me explaining myself. - Hurry.
We'll deal with this later. It's not his fault!
If I don't even have the right to leave the house, tell me plainly that I am your prisoner.
Lock me away!
Listen to me.
You are too old for tantrums.
You must promise me that you will not do anything imprudent.
- What are you trying to say?
- I ask you to be a little patient.
In a few days, you will regain your name, your family, your mother.
You are not pleased that you will finally meet your mother?
It will please me greatly...
You can finally get rid of me!
His Highness, the Duke of Orléans.
Good day, my cousin.
Sirs, be brief and swift.
The charges of state weigh down upon us.
On this tenth day of the month of May, 1 7 1 7, in the reign of Louis XV, under the guardianship of the Duke of Orléans, the Regent of the realm, a family council is convened
at the request of the His Highness, the Prince of Gonzague, for the purpose of ruling upon the existence or non-existence of descendants of the Duke of Nevers, and the distribution of his possessions.
- I have a request, my Lord. - We are listening.
The Princess of Gonzague, my unfortunate wife, asks to be excused from these proceedings which will reawaken painful memories for her, and which risk damaging her delicate state of health.
Granted.
At the Prince of Gonzague's request, the family council allows that his wife, born Isabelle de Qélus, be represented by the King's Counsellor.
- Is there any opposition? - Yes.
- There is an objection. Mine.
- What is this, Madame?
My Lord, I can prove that my daughter, Aurore de Nevers, is alive.
If you allow, I shall present her to you at the ball which you are holding tomorrow at your palace.
- Has grief unbalanced your senses?
- Has she gone mad? - Anguish has disturbed her mind.
My Lord, please forgive me for this incident.
But I can provide three witnesses who can confirm that the bandit Lagardère died in an accident with a horse, and that the child he had stolen found its death in the same manner.
May it please the tribunal to hear the witnesses.
Bring in the witnesses.
My Lord, the witnesses have been abducted, and the armed guard who watched them has disappeared.
What a lovely heart line. I've never seen one like it.
I see women upon this hand. Yes.
How many women have you caused to suffer?
Suffering was not the only thing they felt. Do not exaggerate!
What a seducer!
- You see all that on my hand?
- No, in your eyes.
Do not use your sorcery to try to hypnotise me!
My dear Pérol, this is not like you. You, who wish to be Chief Constable one day.
Allowing genuine prisoners to escape is excusable, but willing prisoners? You admit, it's somewhat feeble.
The man watching over them disappeared at the same time.
- Where did they go?
- I haven't the slightest idea.
At least try to come up with one idea for finding them. You are paid for that.
What is it?
- A hunchback desires an audience.
- Drive him away!
No!
Let him enter.
This clown amuses me sometimes. His hump has always brought me luck.
I advise you to stroke it as he passes, you have a most urgent need of some.
To what do we owe the honour of your visit?
It seems you allow yourself great liberties.
My Lord.
It is necessary, in order to obtain what one wants in life, to show a little audacity, sometimes even great audacity, when one possesses neither beauty nor intelligence, nor the power which heaven has lavished upon you, my Lord. Flatterer.
And what do you hope to gain, my audacious one?
The love of an incomparable beauty.
I am in love with a heavenly creature. A true princess.
Possessing neither charm nor fortune, the only path which remains to me for seducing her is illusion.
- What illusion?
- The illusion of possessing influence.
You want me to ask the Regent to make you a duke?
I cannot be a duke, I am already the King of hunchbacks!
So what do you want from me?
My Lord, if I could obtain two invitations for the Regent's ball, I am certain that my princess would no longer be able to refuse me.
I can refuse nothing to so tender a lover.
Here is what you ask from me.
Thank you, my Lord, thank you.
Touch my hump. Softly, it is painful today.
It will give you twice the good fortune.
I hope you will present me to your princess.
I will not fail to do so.
When something is promised, it must be done!
You were about to commit a terrible act. It is foolish to serve the wicked.
You must be witless not to realise that with such people, when you are no longer of use...
No more gypsies!
But if you are honest with us, nothing untoward will happen to you.
Here I am! If you don't mind, I'll return in a moment.
My Lord, you called me?
Listen, you will need all your wits, and you don't have many to begin with.
This does not bode well for me, I'm sure!
This evening, at the Regent's masked ball, before the nobles of the realm, the Duke of Nevers' daughter will meet her mother.
The resemblance between the two women will unmask Gonzague.
- Everything has been planned.
- But is it in your plans, my Lord, that you could be arrested and hung within the hour?
Don't forget that there is a price on your head.
To gain 5,000 crowns, there are those who would sell their own parents.
Gonzague is cunning, and an all-powerful nobleman.
Today, my right is my power.
- What is happening?
- My dear Aurore. Tonight will be your first ball. Here is your dress.
Aurore, look. I wanted you to be the most beautiful.
It's marvellous!
This evening, you will be the most elegant. Your name demands it.
Your name is the only one that I wish to bear.
I understand that a young lady can be whimsical before her first ball, but do not plan a future you do not control.
I will prove to the world that you are the daughter of the Duke of Nevers.
Prove to me that you are worthy of him. A carriage will come tonight at ten o'clock to take you to the ball.
You, watch for the carriage's arrival, then help her to get in.
- And then?
- Then, you wait for my orders!
And now, no carelessness.
Princess, no time to daydream. Go make yourself beautiful.
I'll bring this up.
I heard everything, my Lord. A carriage is coming at ten o'clock to pick up the young girl and take her to the Regent's ball.
I think we have them this time.
My compliments, Pérol, you selected them well.
But might not your disappearance rouse suspicions and compromise everything?
No, my Lord, my parents remained there with my hat, vest and bag.
They made a figure that looks to be sleeping.
- How beautiful you are!
- What value is it, to be beautiful?
The only man I want to say those words shows only indifference towards me.
Do not believe that! I will explain.
One asks a girl's papa for her hand. As he swore to be a papa to you, he cannot ask himself for your hand.
Not knowing your mother's mind, he will say nothing until he knows she will agree.
- Simple, you see?
- You think I will please him like this?
But you are wonderful, my Aurore. You have the air of a princess.
The carriage is here.
- Goodbye, Aurore.
- Goodbye, Passepoil.
- What's going on?
- Is Aurore not ready?
- Yes, she was ready.
- Then where is she?
- She just departed in the carriage.
- Which carriage? The carriage which came to pick her up.
Oh, good God!
Our little one has been kidnapped!
What is to be done?
Take this, it is the only proof of Aurore's identity.
If I disappear, make sure it reaches the Princess.
Her child's fate depends upon this torn page.
- What will you do, sir?
- I must risk everything.
Willingly or otherwise, I must make Pérol or Gonzague lead me to Aurore.
- To the joys of life! - Yes!
Let us drink to the joys of life.
Let us drink to a future which has never looked so appealing.
To the joys of our fine country.
We didn't come to discuss the country's greatness.
Women will never appreciate the civic virtues. Happily.
I believe this soiree brings us more joy than the Regent's ball.
Speaking of which, would it not be best that you make an appearance there?
I will appear briefly soon after midnight.
Perhaps we will be lucky enough to see the Duke of Nevers' daughter.
I am pleased to welcome you tonight, Princess.
Good evening, Pérol.
The Prince of Gonzague beseeches Your Highness to forgive his tardiness.
It is due to a minor indisposition.
Tell him that I wish him the best of health. And tell him that I hope he will not do anything imprudent.
Madame, would you do me the pleasure of accompanying me?
You seem preoccupied, Madame.
May your dearest wish be granted.
Your restored smile will be the loveliest jewel at this ball, and will give me great joy.
But of course, my friend, we shall discuss it later.
- The excellent Monsieur de Pérol.
- Good evening, hunchback.
What new mischief are you contemplating?
- I seek the Prince of Gonzague.
- To present your princess to him.
Just as I promised him, my Lord, and to express my gratitude.
- But where is he?
- He suffers from a minor illness.
I go to join him immediately. I will therefore be your messenger.
Thank you, my Lord.
Go, and do not spare the horses!
Faster, Passepoil. Faster!
Pass them!
My Lord, to the devil with the Regent! Stay with us.
The sooner I leave such fine company, the sooner I shall return.
Farewell, I will not be long.
When the second chime of midnight sounds, I will be on my way back.
Pérol is here. Artémise, return to our friends.
My Lord, excuse me.
You recognised me in spite of my mask?
- I would recognise you anywhere.
- What do you want?
- Who gave you my secret address?
- Monsieur de Pérol.
He charge me with delivering this ring.
Lagardère wore it some few moments ago upon his hand.
Monsieur de Pérol was slightly injured as he fought.
He is dead, my Lord.
Dear Pérol!
Without a doubt, hunchback, you are our lucky charm!
Let me run my hand over your back one more time.
This evening, I want you to be the King of my celebrations!
My ladies, this evening I wish you to lavish your affections upon my friend, the hunchback. Treat him like a prince.
Let us drink to this bearer of good tidings.
My lords, Lagardère is dead, long live the hunchback!
Lagardère is dead, killed by dear Monsieur de Pérol.
Celebrate this happy event in a fitting manner.
Let us drink to the health of Monsieur de Pérol, and his messenger. Long live Pérol!
Long live the hunchback!
Amuse yourselves until I return. Duty calls, but my house is yours.
I leave you with my loveliest friends. Artémise, be gentle, he is a romantic.
He has told me of his love, it is truly moving.
And you, my Lord, are not an easy man to move!
His eyes are so lovely, I could never be cruel.
He has a proud bearing, and a noble figure.
He lacks only a sword to be a true gentleman.
If I lack only that, my Lord, this is now rectified!
In that case, en garde!
There is a time for everything, my Lord.
When the time comes, I will be ready.
- While I wait, I will quench my thirst.
- My cellar is yours. - Thank you, my Lord.
- Farewell, gallant sir.
But no, not "farewell". Until we meet again soon.
We will not finish this evening without you, my Lord.
My Lady!
I hope you will excuse my tardiness caused by a sudden illness.
I had expected to arrive before midnight.
- Have you good tidings to pass on? - No, my Lord.
I have very bad tidings which will cause you surprise and grief.
Your friend, your faithful confident,
Monsieur de Pérol, has been killed.
He was marked with a deep wound between the eyes.
The "Nevers strike", I have been informed.
You understand, Madame, that I do what duty impels me.
I do not know what impels you, sir. But I strongly doubt that it is your duty.
Good sir, do you wish for me to die of thirst?
It's not our fault the hunchback tarries in the cellar!
He is tasting all the vintages, the lucky devil! How ungrateful!
You should go yourself!
We all begged him to find us something to drink.
It was he who obligingly suggested it.
- He likes drinking more than wooing. - The devil take all drunkards!
I wager that we shall soon find him in the cellar sleeping under a barrel.
Do not be afraid, I beg of you. Do not cry out.
I am here to save you. Do you not recognise my voice?
Can it then be you?
Be brave.
Be brave, Aurore. Control your feelings.
Come with me.
Aurore, go back up!
Where is the hunchback?
He must be found. He will pay dearly for his treachery!
Come, follow me.
Your deception is revealed. Commend your soul to God!
Not before I send yours to hell.
Go back up, protect yourself. Surrender, hunchback.
You are lost!
The hunchback is dead.
Long live Lagardère!
As for you, treacherous Prince, notorious murderer, since you have not come to Lagardère, it is Lagardère who comes to you!
Attack him!
You, climb up there.
You, take the secret stairway to the gallery.
I beg you, get behind me!
He fell into the trap. Come, we attack from behind!
His Royal Highness, the Prince of Orléans, Regent of the realm.
What is happening?
First of all, good sirs, surrender your swords.
Cousin, excuse this inopportune visit.
I note that you have recovered from your indisposition. One shouldn't be a slave to protocol, don't you think?
You were late to my ball, so I am early to yours.
It is not my custom to allow an outlaw, a condemned man, to carry a sword!
We shall speak more about it, sir.
My child, my daughter.
So this young woman lived in your house and you kept it secret.
Her remarkable resemblance to the Princess of Gonzague, this never struck you?
I was preparing to take her to your ball. Yes, Madame.
- We were leaving when Lagardère...
- Murderer!
I marked your hand in the ditches around the castle of Qélus.
I was defending Nevers! Why deny it?
You know well that you are lost.
Madame, please give me the paper which my servant gave you.
Before dying, the Duke of Nevers wrote in blood the name of his killer on his daughter's birth certificate.
As you will see, this name is your own!
I will hear it from your mouth. Villain!
You confess your crime!
There was nothing written on the paper!
One moment, sirs!
May my sword and your arms be the instruments of the King's justice.
Let us trust in God's judgment. En garde, sirs!
Do not be afraid.
May God bless your union.
Chevalier de Lagardère, the daughter of our sadly-missed friend Nevers could not choose a more worthy or more loyal husband than the one we now make the Count of Lagardère.
The King will soon reach his majority, and he alone can make you a duke.
I always believed that everything would end well.
This is a film you want to make... but do I, or television, or audiences really need it?
Besides it's full of booby traps and blacked-out areas...
No one's made a film about the fifties yet.
I'm not an idiot; I'm very serious about this.
I'm not interested in doing any old film for my thesis.
This film needs a good director. You're very young.
You'll get some old codger who knew him, saw him, who knows!
This is my subject.
Besides, I've already started it.
I'll give you another one, "steel".
That's what interests us, it's essential and not hypocritical.
I learned my subject matter from my father.
I'm giving you good advice. I have contacts, materials, interviews, really good stuff.
Young people will be interested...
You're ignoring the facts... steelworkers, mills, the increases in steel production...
So you haven't got the materials for me?
I'm not interested in controversy. It would be the end of... me, you and your film.
Those materials have always been off-limits.
This is bottom line, understand?
- How old are you?
- 28.
And you have 21 days to finish shooting.
MAN OF MARBLE
We're from Polish Television...
Yes, the director told me to assist you.
The museum's closed today, so I'm afraid there isn't much light.
What's this film about, anyway?
The director would like to know. Do you have a script?
Yes, I do.
Keep her busy.
What's down there?
Nothing interesting, the oldest collections.
- Before World War II?
- No, 25 years ago.
We're the only institution which buys works of art.
- Were they ever displayed?
- Of course.
- Didn't you see them?
- I was born too late.
Where are you going?
Let's go back, there's nothing there.
I just want to look around a bit.
- What's going on here?
- I'll explain...
Is there enough light?
We'll manage if we raise it and put the camera on a tripod.
What tripod?
Well, well, my dear...
I like that one.
That's strange. May I ask... why that one?
There are far better pieces here.
I don't know.
It's not important.
Could I take some pictures?
Pictures?
!
The director doesn't even like... people visiting here.
Good morning, please prepare the film.
Hello...
Can you hear me, gentlemen?
Yes, good morning...
Good morning.
Good morning.
Perhaps we could arrange a hotel room for you. It'd be cheaper than sleeping here.
Hello.
I've chosen materials which more or less concern that bricklayer.
More or less.
This stuff's 25 years old and it's hard to remember everything.
Are you going to sit there or next to me?
I don't know if there's anything to choose from here.
It's boring footage. This is your thesis?
So you think it's boring?
I'm not here to think, I'm here to splice.
- What did you do at school?
- Short studies.
Cortazar's, of course. Or maybe your own screenplay?
- Agnieszka.
- I did different things.
I know, life as it happens, hidden cameras...
Television likes that, audiences less, but they'll give you a job.
Roll the film, please.
- What do we have here?
- A profile of Birkut, fascinating!
- Have you ever met him?
- Only his statue.
There were better looking guys. Why him?
I don't know. Maybe because he was tipped over.
I'd advise you to choose quickly. Projection rooms are hard to get.
These are outtakes. They never made it into any film.
For technical reasons, of course..
Hold on, this is called "A City is Born."
It was supposed to be called that. A thesis piece too, by Burski.
I haven't cut anything, pretty soon you'll see Birkut.
Also outtakes.
Here he comes...
That's him.
Birkut, Mateusz.
Where do you come from?
Lencz, a village near Krakow.
Parents?
They live there.
What does your father do?
He has some land.
A lot?
Not much.
Did you work anywhere else earlier?
On the land.
- So you don't know anything.
- No, I do...
On that land...
What are they angry about?
The fish, I guess.
I love fish.
But only one fish for dinner...
I understand.
- Burski made these kinds of films?
- He quickly stopped.
Now you'll see a fragment of his film titled:
"Building our Happiness."
I've chosen the parts with Birkut.
The rest is very similar.
Please roll the film.
We're ready.
Building our Happiness. A film by Jerzy Burski.
The festively decorated main hall of Warsaw's Polytechnic... and the annual New Year's Eve Ball... for those most deserving:
Party and government dignitaries... lead workers... farmers, teachers, and academics.
Among them, Mateusz Birkut, a leading worker from Nowa Huta.
Mateusz Birkut, from a poor village... with thousands of others... joins the battle for a better tomorrow.
A huge steel mill is being built near Krakow... together with a new city.
This marks the site where, on April 26, 1950... the first worker began construction.
From across Poland, stream... masses of workers, including volunteers from the Youth Union... and Service to Poland.
As the city grows, so do the people.
They are not alone. Management lends a hand... by providing... worker's hotels... where, after work, they can relax and do some reading.
It was here on the building site... that Mateusz Birkut... began, together with other young volunteers. Under the watchful eye of experienced bricklayers... like Ozanski and others... he learned this demanding and beautiful trade.
The honorable title "builder of Nowa Huta"... demands not only manual labor... but academic work too and everyone can learn here.
He worked and studied...
Here is where he met his future wife.
We know her from the newsreels.
Hanka Tomczyk, the pride of...
Nowa Huta athletes, began like everyone and leaned to live... and work here.
The landscape is changing.
Where once were fields... we now see Nowa Huta, the largest investment of the 6-year plan.
President Bierut's arrival is a holiday for the crew. A warm welcome, applause... a handshake and a moment that many... have dreamed of.
A leading worker, Hanka Tomczyk... feels distinguished.
It was then that Mateusz Birkut... took up the challenge of the other bricklayers, 30,000 bricks... laid in one shift.
That was his slogan.
It happened here.
A result like that required efficient teamwork.
We see it here, a good team.
Many came to watch, to nervously observe...
Will they do it?
They've done it! ...30 thousand... 509 bricks.
The five heroes at the finish line. Now flowers, handshakes and cheers.
Such was the beginning of his march to later successes.
Comrades selected Mateusz Birkut... to be a delegate to the Builders' Convention... and later to the Convention of lead workers.
And so men like Birkut became the inspiration for artists. A marble statue takes form... a symbol of the heroism of our bricklayers.
An art exhibition at the Zacheta Gallery in Warsaw.
It is opened by the one whose statue is the... centerpiece of the showing.
Mateusz Birkut may claim with satisfaction that: "We have played our part... in the revolution in Polish art."
Indeed. They were its engine... raw material, and substance. The people were now on canvas.
Look at... the degenerate works of artists... from the capitalistic west.
It's no accident they have removed from the human form... its shape... and substance.
Here comes old Krakow, while right behind... it's younger sister...
Nowa Huta, as old as the 6-year plan.
The "Trumanillo" circus was a hit.
Mr. Truman and his friends, reactionary rats and insects.
Eisenhower and Adenauer as bride and groom.
Franco dressed as Carmen. And, kicked out of Korea...
McArthur.
People reach out for... quickly printed... leaflets. As if symbolizing the millions of hands which, thanks to the... People's Republic, have received books and newspapers.
The day long-dreamed of arrives. They receive their own flat.
One of those which they built with their own hands and hearts.
Mateusz and Hanka Birkut have a home of their own.
They are understandably moved.
All around them they see the fruits of their joint efforts.
In each block of flats there is a drop of their sweat.
Is that everything?
Yes.
I'd like this shown too.
I found a little filler.
Roll the film, please.
Just a minute...
There's no sound, as it was never used... for "technical" reasons.
Roll it.
What was all that about?
I cut and splice film, I don't get involved with the subject matter.
What happened to him later?
We'll find that out in your film.
I saw the film about Birkut.
You must know it.
- I shot the pictures. - But Burski made it!
He directed and edited. That was...
It got an award, it did.
That was a long time ago, 24 years.
I'd like to talk to Burski.
Good idea, Burski likes to support young talent.
Is he in Warsaw?
No, he's returning from some festival.
I heard they're going to meet him at the airport.
It's a good idea to keep your ear to the ground.
What are you so worried about?
Times are tough, Agnieszka.
I'd like to... keep working. But I guess this'll be my last film.
I've written to the Minister... with a request to let me continue. I haven't had an answer yet.
We're ready!
We're not going to use a tripod. Only handheld and wide-angle lens just like the new American films...
I was only on the jury. I'm pleased by the success... but it belongs to them.
But it's thanks to you that Polish films are recognized world-wide.
I'm flattered by your opinion, but it was really them...
There's a woman here from Polish Television...
But I'm going to Prague today!
Your tickets are all taken care of.
So you're the television lady?
Just don't ask me about the trip or the festival; please be original.
I'm doing my thesis. A film.
What about?
A simple story, here's the title, "Stars of a Single Season."
Sports stars or screen stars?
Former lead workers. Then and now.
That's history.
For me, ancient history.
That's why I want to make this film.
How moving.
And I'm to be granddad by the fireplace... telling tales of how we built Warsaw and Nowa Huta, eh?
That's very moving. But impossible, as I'm leaving today.
To Prague, I know.
When I return, perhaps?
What are you doing this afternoon?
Me?
Different things.
Good-bye.
Too bad.
You knew Birkut, didn't you?
Knew Him?
! He was my greatest discovery!
That was my biggest stunt.
You think this Birkut, now...?
I'm simply curious.
The story if his career, and what followed.
The story of a career?
First some materials from the archives...
With your permission.
...then a few interviews, cinema verite, but that's old hat.
I saw one of your earlier films.
Which one?
- "Building our Happiness." - "A City is Born."
It's too bad you never finished it.
Are you doing a film about Birkut, or about me?
You see, I don't lament over... my own, "what followed?"
Anna Maria!
Marysia!
Daddy!
You forgot your dog. Tell me, what's his name?
- Where's my wife?
- Off on a shooting session.
- When will she be back?
- Late...
My dear lady, film, especially a documentary, is not literature.
There's no tomorrow, everything is now or never.
You have to know what's important, have that awareness...
I was once young, as you are now, and I had to start somewhere.
Nothing worked for two years, until I finally got smart.
And you made your mark with Birkut?
I wanted to do a film about someone else, but all the better... lead workers already had backers.
Older colleagues of mine had every construction record... clenched in their teeth like a bone.
Marysia...?
So I had to think up...
Something to drink?
I needed an idea and so I thought up Birkut.
At first it was only a vague outline.
It concerned... the fact, not the person, and only took form in Nowa Huta.
I used to go there often, shooting short pieces for the newsreels.
Hi.
What are you filming today?
We've got new showers.
Warm water and free soap.
Violet-scented toilet bars?
I'll wait till there's shampoo.
What is it?
What have you got for the upcoming Trade Union Congress?
That. We're building.
So, you're building. That's not a stunt.
What's a stunt?
Something hot and loud, that's a stunt.
Stupal was a stunt.
10,000 bricks in one shift!
Not some "We're building."
I hear you, comrade.
But records are once in a blue moon, but we have a good crew... good technology and organization.
In the long run...
Forget that...
Besides, you can have both.
Let's do a stunt for 30,000.
Comrade, you have two hands. So does a bricklayer.
I'd have to give him two more.
Mr. Jodla, I don't know anything about laying bricks.
What's the "three-man" system?
You want the short version?
It's like this. A bricklayer used to work alone, now he has two helpers.
And they lay 20 thousand?
Maybe they do, maybe they don't. I've never seen it done.
That's what the papers say.
So give him four, six, eight, ten, the whole association.
And I'll film it.
It was there, in Nowa Huta, that I saw him clearly.
We have to find a tough guy, one who'll last the eight hours.
Who do you think will make it?
Adamowski, Stepniak?
Afterwards we'll send him on vacation to Krynica.
Hold on, not so fast!
His helpers have to be the best too.
Before that, in secret...
Are you crazy, lay bricks in secret?
Sure, for an hour, to rehearse.
The rest depends on how the work's organized.
If we create the best conditions... we might just pull it off.
It's midnight.
It's midnight already, Birkut.
You'll never get up tomorrow.
Yes I will.
I can do a lot, if I have to.
We need five.
You think you won't find five crazies on a site like this?
But we can't blow it.
That's a shit-load of bricks.
We'll lay them.
Just so it's not a circus.
You know, for the camera.
Me, for the camera?
I'm doing it for me, to see if you can build a house in two weeks.
Why not one week?
Who the hell knows, maybe?
Everybody would have a home...
Yeah, that's true.
So, is it a deal?
Get some sleep.
I can't.
Count bricks, that'll help.
Ten thousand calories a day!
- For how long?
- Two weeks.
What's the matter?
...
Eat!
I'm full.
- Just one more slice...
- I can't!
Coffee?
- It's no good, it's bitter.
- So what?
...drink some anyway.
It'll make you stronger.
- All right, half then.
- All of it.
It's real, Brazilian.
I made sure he had the best conditions.
I'm ready.
With a mug like that?
He needs a shave. All of them do.
I shave on Sundays. It's Thursday.
- What time is it?
- It's late.
Send a car into town and bring back some barbers!
This is Jodla!
Barbers with razors. We're going to do some shaving!
- Ties?
- No, no...
Cigarette?
I'm glad you're here. I want to cover some details.
The camera's simply a tool, it registers what it sees.
I would've shaved yesterday if you'd have told me.
The barbers will be here soon. You have to look good...
I understand...
But you can't do that. I'll do whatever I have to...
But you can't force-feed people like they were geese.
Fine, now let's agree. When I say "camera"... you work lightly and easily. When I say "stop"... you work as you normally do.
I'll make it.
All clear.
Who's that?
Just in case. We have to be careful.
Maybe I'll do it myself?
Maybe I'll do it myself?
Cologne?
Go ahead.
Now back to the barrack.
I can't film them coming out of the office, and get the audience.
Let the audience go.
This is Polish Radio... from the residential housing development in Nowa Huta.
We are located at the largest... construction site of the 6-year plan, a steel mill... and city for 100,000 residents.
Before Polish workers start up the Soviet machines... Polish bricklayers are going to attempt an ambitious feat...
Ready?
Energetically, go on, easy does it, more like workers!
Mr. Birkut looks good, the rest are too stiff.
That's not it. Back inside.
Let's try it again.
Mateusz Birkut's brigade... aims to lay 28,000 bricks during the course of one shift...
The crew consists of five men.
One man lays only the exterior layer of bricks... directing the others, who do the rest.
Working alone, one man can lay 1,750 bricks, at the most.
Mateusz Birkut's brigade will lay 28,000.
Feelings are high... and shared by all those present...
Ready!
Start!
What are you doing?
Let's do it again.
Go to the office.
The battle against time has begun.
We see a perfect example of organization and... enthusiasm which these boys have brought to this difficult task.
Happy!
...
Happy!
...
Great!
We see their toil and we all know... that this achievement is possible... thanks to the self-sacrifice of our heroic working class!
We have the first results...
We're rolling!
Smile!
Let's see your face!
Mateusz Birkut's feat may launch a revolution in construction techniques.
It's not only a building foundation which is being laid... but the foundations of a new life... and prosperity for working people as well.
Are you falling asleep?
Start playing!
What's going on?
Come here! ...
Hurry up!
The next stage, the sixth layer.
They've been working for four hours. 13,926 bricks have been laid.
Briskly and more cheerfully...
Briskly and more cheerfully!
Hurry up!
Everybody's waiting!
Stand up here and start playing.
Play, play!
Polish Radio listeners... the sixth hour of work... has now passed.
The tenth layer is finished, a total of 23,210 bricks.
One more hour.
What's wrong?
They're doing fine.
I'm worried about them.
It's going well, they'll make it.
The battle against time and fatigue continues.
We've reached the final minutes... the final bricks, the final effort.
- There's no more mint tea. - But it's going well.
The shift is over!
30,509 bricks!
An incredible record!
Birkut's team not only laid... the 28,000 they said they would... but a great many more!
Shift's over!
Shift's over.
Our sincere congratulations.
It's a moving moment for everyone.
I'm sorry.
What a man!
Stop, let's do it again.
Take the flowers.
Birkut, look lively and happy!
Two more bricks, then come down.
Another achievement in the fight for the 6-year plan and for peace.
You'll go far, I'll see to it.
I'm keeping this brick as a souvenir.
I didn't lie, he did get far.
You both did.
Well, sure. - But he...
- Where is he?
You're making a film about him and you don't know where he is?
I have this idea... - of following his footsteps. - Interesting, but it's been done.
So what?
Tell me more.
I lost track of him. I had work, trips abroad...
How about having dinner with us?
I saw his picture being taken down in a newsreel.
It happens. They put them up, take them down.
Wait... he hired a bunch of Gypsies. They followed him, played music, he broke a window somewhere...
Ask around, lot's of people knew him.
I can give you an address.
OK, a letter of introduction too.
Are you going somewhere?
It's everything I own.
Not much.
It's easier to make films that way.
Perhaps you're right.
Testing, one, two, three.
Make sure you get it down.
Testing, one, two...
I want to leave.
Wait a minute!
Quit shoving!
Where are you going?
To Mr. Michalak, the director.
Where are we going, and what for?
This is absolutely crazy!
Mr. Michalak?
Mr. Michalak, I have a letter for you.
- Strip tease or topless?
- Everything, if you help me.
Please get undressed.
Please listen to me. I'm making a film and Burski gave me your name.
I'm having problems and I need to talk to you.
You're the only one who can...
Later.
But it'll only take a few minutes.
They have their models, big butts are what count, to land softly.
Very good, today's youth is much better looking.
So you're interested in Birkut?
That's good, young people should know their fathers' history... and learn from their mistakes.
Well?
I'd like you to tell me. You know which period interests me?
I should think so. From the time he was burned?
Everything was fine until then.
Truth was he no longer laid bricks. He didn't have the time.
They moved him to the inspectorate, to the association.
I felt then that it wasn't for him.
What?
The inspectorate.
He took everything too literally.
What, I don't understand?
In what sense?
Well, you know...
Could I have a cigarette?
Of course he had a few worthwhile ideas.
safety shoes... a dining hall... but later... Although judging it today even I... never mind.
After the incident... he went off the deep end.
It happened during his last trip to the field.
He used to make these long trips demonstrating team bricklaying.
It took a lot out of him, so we limited these visits.
If the area was well prepared, he'd go alone. If not, he took along helpers.
Ever onward young Slavs, onward Greeks and young Spaniards.
Young Chinese join the march from Asia.
Others soon there will join ya...
Negro brothers from Virginia and heroes hurrying from Malaysia.
Listen to this.
Three neighbors from the village, off to work they went.
While two worked, the third laughed with merriment.
Hard work doesn't pay at all, it's time that is misspent.
Lying in a cozy hammock... is a job for Michalak, Oh, they did lament...
Oh, they did lament.
This song is about Nowa Huta about Nowa Huta these words.
So simple and pretty and new as lovely as singing of birds.
We're here.
Just a minute...
Whose first?
Start!
Hold it!
Nobody moves!
Get away!
To the clinic!
I'll find whoever did this!
Nobody moves!
Good evening, comrade.
Can't sleep?
I understand.
It's hard to sleep after something like that.
Did they take good care of it?
Put iodine on it?
No.
- They poured water on them.
- Hydrogen peroxide?
We'll check into it. Does it hurt?
Sure it hurts. What do you think?
How could a worker do it to another worker?
Don't people understand?
They want houses, but doing it the old way will take a hundred years.
We're cranking up the quotas.
No everyone likes that.
And you... didn't you feel the brick was hot?
- I had gloves on.
- Thick ones, I bet.
Not very.
Had shingles a long time?
I don't really, I just said I did, but I do have eczema.
Eczema?
Let's see your hands!
Well?
Hey, can't you guys take a joke?
Who are you, anyway?
Always tailing us...get lost!
I'm going.
Excuse me.
Good night, comrades.
If you need anything, just call.
Birkut no longer worked in construction.
His health started to fail him.
But he became deeply involved in social issues.
He found housing for workers.
He fought tooth and nail for every one of them.
He fought for months with the housing authorities.
He usually won.
That's when he was happiest and supervised every move.
The people loved him; you could even say they worshipped him.
Mateusz!
Come here a minute...
- What do you think of this?
- I'll go with you.
- You don't have to.
- I want to.
- I'll go and be right back.
- No, you'll just cause trouble.
No, no.
I remember.
All right.
All taken care of.
Yes.
Could you please ask if I could go in there?
In there?
Of course. I was surprised you were waiting.
The colonel will gladly see you.
To what do I owe this honor?
Please sit down.
Coffee?
Excuse me... where's the other comrade?
Who?
That bricklayer?
He left.
How?
That's right.
Comrade secretary, did you see the other comrade go out?
I was busy and didn't notice.
But it did seem strange that comrade kept pacing... as if he were waiting for someone.
I was afraid to ask.
Exactly.
I sometimes get so mixed up I don't know what I'm doing.
Well then... How about a cigarette?
Still in bandages?
Something wrong?
They're festering.
This long?
I got them dirty laying bricks. It was an urgent job.
Now they're festering.
Strange. They keep bandaging them and yet they continue to fester.
Where's Witek?
Wincenty Witek, the bricklayer.
We came in together.
What have you done with him?
Comrade Birkut... you haven't had a vacation in a long time. Why don't you go to the mountains and get some rest?
I'll help you if you have any problems.
Krynica?
How about Zakopane?
You'll regret this!
I'll go wherever I have to!
I'll even go to Warsaw!
You'll get yours, you'll see!
Autumn came...
Autumn came and it rained continuously... but Birkut... kept fighting to free Witek.
He went to all the bureaus... and government offices.
Finally he took a leave and decided... to go to the capitol, even though it wasn't the best moment.
His wife was having a difficult pregnancy.
The overall situation was bad too.
Maybe my letters aren't getting through. I have to go there.
Wait. I have to.
Mateusz, don't go.
I must.
- Go home.
- No.
I won't go.
- Go!
- No.
Excuse me...
Could I see you a minute?
This is private, because I like you. You don't like me, but I've always liked you.
When you set that record, I couldn't eat or sleep.
I've made you an example to my son.
I have one son, he has three names:
Jozef, Boleslaw, and Bartlomiej.
- Bartlomiej?
- After my father-in-law.
Since you like me, get lost. I asked you once already!
I can't, the enemy lurks.
You don't understand and you're causing a lot of trouble.
This is my personal advice... leave it alone, it's a dirty case.
Bullshit!
... I know Witek and he's a decent guy.
Decent!
But they call him, Wiktorio.
So what? ...
He was in Spain.
Exactly.
Is that bad?
Of course not, but where was he after that?
In France, in a POW camp.
You're young comrade, you don't know how they recruited spies.
All the intelligence services were sniffing around there.
They recruited him, he took his time getting close to you... then they told him to give you the brick.
What brick?
That brick, comrade Birkut!
Hop on, I'll take you home.
Mateusz, the train's leaving!
See you...
When I get back, you'll all sing a different tune!
Here's some plum cake. It came out a little thin...
Take care of yourself.
You've reached high, getting to me. It's not easy to do.
There are only 24 hours in a day for both of us.
But there's an ideological battle being fought.
So forgive me for being brief...
I'm familiar with your case and I'll try to clear things up.
But I'm not from Warsaw, I've come from Nowa Huta.
I'd like something definite.
Don't be childish, there's a political war going on in Poland.
Conditions are difficult...
Don't interrupt, I don't have time.
If there's been a mistake made, we'll straighten it out.
It happens sometimes and then we react quickly.
My request of you is, don't do anything on your own.
Trust the people's justice.
- I do trust it, but...
- Nothing on your own.
I know the case. I'll take care of it.
I've called a special commission. No one will be mistreated.
And you, comrade Birkut, calmly wait for the result.
PART II
He returned a week later, much grayer.
There was a meeting in the new hall.
He went there straight from the station. ...socialism is able to reach... straight to the human mind by way of example.
We don't want to dominate. We have friends everywhere.
In millions of workers, farmers and intellectuals...
You're not on the agenda and there's going to be a funny film.
But it's very important!
No...
The text hasn't been approved. What do you plan to say?
Get away from the mike!
People... this is about comrade Witek... A good man who they're mistreating! I've been everywhere!
... tried everything, even in Warsaw...
People!
...
Onward young workers!
Hard work unites us today!
Join the work brigades!
We'll join our hearts and minds...
A few days later, without telling anyone, I borrowed a bicycle... and went to see the Birkuts.
I knew what had happened.
The scene on the square didn't even surprise me.
Did you need to do that?
I warned you, didn't I?
But it can still be put right... saved... so that everything isn't lost.
Such a comrade, such a lead worker!
Cut yourself off.
Hanka, the keys!
Please...
I'm asking you privately, cut yourself off.
I'm doing everything I can, in my written and oral reports.
I destroyed one denunciation, but how long can I go on?
They're starting to poke through your records.
They're looking.
Let them, I'm clean as a whistle.
No you're not!
...
Who threw fish at his boss two years ago?
Waiter!
I want to pay!
Don't touch that!
- What's this?
- Money.
It's not enough!
What's this?
Minister...
My coat!
Let's go!
The bricklayer's waltz!
There!
Now we're even.
Are you serious about making... an honest film about those times?
Are you sure?
That's my intention.
Word of honor?
I don't have any secrets.
I'll take the film, please.
- And?
- And shit!
Are you giving it to him?
Relax!
Filming isn't allowed in here.
This is amateur stuff...
The rest is in the archives, shot by a newsreel photographer.
The "Skocznia" case, I was a witness.
I'll remember that.
Well, it's good-bye then.
Privately, do you think Witek was guilty?
He was rehabilitated and is now in a very high position.
That's all I'm saying.
Not in there...
What's going on, where have you been, what are you looking for?
Materials.
From strippers?
People are calling...
This wasn't our agreement.
There was someone there...
The hell with him...
That was a bad address, a bad idea, and lack of a concept.
Where have you been going?
You're playing capture the flag...
Warned, they'd have stonewalled.
Nothing came of it anyway!
Besides, this isn't America, these aren't the methods to use...
There's a film.
Exposed.
Zero, a total bust!
You're doing as you please, and I asked you... not to touch that, that it was off-limits...
You can't do whatever you like!
I won't stand for anarchy!
And that idea of mine... the Katowice steelworks and Witek. He has to be in this film.
It can be arranged. I've arranged bigger deals.
- I've got to run...
- To Katowice!
I'm sorry, but it's an order.
Please go, he's waiting for you. Wincenty Witek.
It has to be done, simply, with no surprises...
I have our materials about Birkut.
In the newsreel we're about to see he doesn't even appear.
The other material was stored away from the studio.
I'm glad they let you have it.
I am too.
Where are you sitting?
Roll film, please.
Polish Film Newsreel
Traitors on Trial.
In Warsaw, the trial of the... subversive "Skocznia" gang continues.
The four accused all had a common goal... slowing our country's development.
The Peoples' Republic gave them a chance to work and advance... which they spurned, choosing treason instead.
Socialist construction men, trusted by their fellow workers... they tried to wreck the efforts of an entire nation... by falsifying building plans... and striking out at lead workers.
Today they act remorseful... but yesterday they were ready to ally themselves... even with Guderian's soldiers.
The prosecutor refutes their lies... proving the defendants' links to foreign intelligence.
Here they are:
J. Wolodkiewicz, head of the Association.
M. Pawlusiak, supervising inspector.
M. Herc, accountant.
W. Witek, team bricklaying instructor.
This trial is a clear lesson to us all.
We must be ever vigilant.
That was the first day of the trial.
Questioning of the witnesses was later and we shall also show it.
They never did. We're the first ones to see it.
Thank you, roll the next film.
The witness has testified... not under oath, because he is suspected of activities similar... to those of the accused, W. Witek.
However, he is still obliged to tell the truth.
The witness... is accused of organizing a terrorist group... and attacking the headquarters of public law and order.
What do you say to the accusations?
Does the witness recognize the accused, here in the courtroom?
Yes, I do.
The accused has admitted attempting to cause you bodily harm.
Did the witness know of Witek's plans earlier?
Yes, I did.
I asked if you knew before hand, what he planned to do.
Yes, I did.
I knew about everything.
- Do you understand the question?
- Yes, of course.
I knew about it from the very beginning.
That can't be so.
The witness has testified that he trusted the accused... and that he'd been deceived.
Not at all!
It was a mutual action.
Mutual?
That makes no sense at all.
The accused considered the witness a committed activist.
That's not true.
Our groups worked together. Lead workers were to be attacked.
So, we chose each other.
Both of us were lead workers, so...
But in your deposition, I can read it to you... you state something else entirely.
I lied, just like every enemy.
Once I attacked my superior with a fish.
That's right, a little fish.
But during your interrogation, you said something else.
Do you know what goes on there?
Want me to tell you?
I'm with you!
I retract my testimony!
I retract everything!
I take back everything!
Well sweetheart, for that... you've got a small vodka and a large ice cream on me.
Did you want to say something?
Not yet, you know I save it till the end.
Here's your material.
Let's go find Witek.
That won't be hard. Bigwigs are easy to find.
Leonard... starting today, it's handheld only... using this.
This is great, but when are we landing?
In two minutes, right on schedule.
Look there...
- The center of the mill... - I'm interested in talking to you.
I know better.
- Please have a look...
- But you don't have time!
We'll talk, don't worry.
Why the 1950s? ...
Young people are interested in this steel mill.
In 1980 it'll be the most modern steel mill in the world.
Talk to me, I'm begging you.
I'd start from the war in Spain, but what about my childhood?
The personality takes shape between the ages of 3 and 5.
My father was a cobbler...
I want to know about Birkut.
I was getting to him.
I met him in Nowa Huta.
He came from a poor village...
Not then, after prison. You were released first.
How did you know?
They released Birkut at the end of October... A welcome-home reception was arranged.
There were people, flowers, an orchestra... and we went to the station.
Is this all?
Where's everyone else?
Is everyone here?
You have to say something...
- It's your turn...
- I've had my fill of speeches.
I'm begging you, the moment demands it!
- Did everyone know about it?
- I announced it...
Go on, tell them the truth!
Comrade Birkut...
Friends...
I thank you very much.
It's late.
We'll never get up; let's go home and go to work tomorrow.
What is it, comrade?
Not a word about mistakes, distortions, the historic moment?
I'll leave that to you.
Comrade Birkut is tired, which is understandable.
Let him regain his strength and he'll help us in our struggle!
Long live comrade Birkut!
Excuse me...
- There aren't any street signs...
- New in town?
We live here... and don't need... street signs.
Is that building C-2?
I don't know, the numbers are the same as in every city.
Are the barracks still standing?
Yes, go straight and then turn left... at the third street, past the flower shop, then straight ahead.
A pack of cigarettes, please.
And some matches.
I thought you knew. Everyone knows.
I was sure you knew.
I was sure.
I haven't had any contact with her for three years.
Didn't she write to you?
No, and now... She's with someone?
No, that's not it.
- She probably felt like a fool...
- Why?
Forget her.
I understand how it was then, she was a star athlete...
She wanted it very much, but to go so low...?
She denounced you publicly... as a lackey and an enemy.
To hell with her, she's no good!
There are plenty of others!
There's a lot of to be done. We've been waiting for you.
A committee's been formed, and soon a board of directors... let me finish.
You'll be chosen for sure. You're important here.
I'm leaving, close everything up. I'm going to find her.
Are you crazy?
At a time like this?
Did he find her?
I don't know, but he never returned to the mill again...
See those three giant loaders over there?
Two others work at the North Port.
Weren't those words about his wife overly harsh?
Maybe.
What was the deal with their marriage?
Why are you so nervous?
Relax, take it easy.
So, tell me about it.
Just between us... in all honesty she never was his wife.
What do you mean?
I saw the newsreels.
Sure, there was even a wedding, but...
You want the truth?
It was like this.
We all went there, along with you guys... a film crew.
The Marriage Bureau was in a village called Mogila.
The guy in charge was old school. A real stickler!
He asked Hanka for her ID. She was only sixteen.
So he demanded a court statement. She didn't have that either.
So he refused to marry them.
He stuck to his guns. We could use his kind here.
But those were different times.
What to do?
The guy wasn't about to budge.
We're negotiating, arguing, and meanwhile... a thousand people are waiting, trucks and vodka...
It was a tough situation.
Then Jodla, our Party Secretary, had an idea.
He told the official to keep his mouth shut... and us comrades were to not say a word either.
...Warsaw!
... The Ministry!
- And that's the way it stayed.
- Do you have Birkut's address?
I looked for him, but with all the work I didn't have time...
Sorry, I have to run.
This is my assistant, they're filmmakers.
We have artists here every day.
I'll see you tonight. Maybe I'll remember something else.
That piece at the top of the furnace we call "pants".
The furnace "puts them on" before being fired.
We're part of the old guard from Nowa Huta.
All of you were Birkut's friends yet no one knows where he is.
- Do you know his address?
- No, I don't.
But I saw Hanka in Zakopane... you know, his wife.
They were never married.
How do you know that?
I went back a few times, but I never saw her again.
I guess she doesn't live there anymore.
I don't know.
"Stars of a Single Season?" Not a bad season!
Go in for a close-up.
You're the film crew?
Welcome...
So, you're the one who called?
Your shoes!
I asked you to wipe your feet because the finish is new.
I've prepare a little something...
It took us all night to get here.
How did you ever find me?
It's me you want to interview?
Yes, I've been looking for you for a long time.
What can I do for you?
Though I don't quite understand. I left sports a long time ago.
Since moving here, I only ski.
That's fine, we're here to talk about Mateusz.
Mateusz Birkut, lead worker.
Your first husband.
They'll set up the camera and we'll chat.
No.
Oh no.
Not about him!
What did you expect to hear?
That's not it. I'm a woman too. I just want the facts.
The facts, that's all.
About his arrival here, how it went... how he looked.
I already know a lot about him. I've gotten it out of people.
All of you owe him something.
He was terribly stubborn.
But he managed to find me here. And he came.
May I?
On vacation?
No.
Just passing through?
Planning to stay long?
No.
Boss, I need an order of bread, no make it two.
There's a new customer.
I'll be right there.
What do you want?
Tea.
With lemon?
No, thanks. Is there any plum cake?
We don't serve deserts.
Just tea then.
Nothing?
Tea.
- Boss...
- Just a minute.
Hold on!
- None with sardines?
- I've got sprats though.
- Boss...
- One moment!
I have to leave.
- Don't you feel well?
- No, I'm fine.
- But I just have to.
- Wait another hour.
It'll be too late then.
Who is he?
Nobody.
I'll stay.
Your tea's getting cold!
Sit down.
I'm working.
All right, I'll wait.
Can I get some cake?
Since you want to know, it's all over between us.
It was supposed to be without lemon.
Shall I take it back?
No, I'm not fussy. Sit down when you have a minute.
That's how I imagined it.
Please don't get upset. But you did speak later, right?
You must have spoken... What did he say?
Please tell me.
You should've said so right away!
It's all right, please help yourself.
You don't look like you've been overeating lately.
Go right ahead, it's all for you. Which do you prefer?
I've never had either of them.
Well then, now you will!
You're like me, you sniff more than you drink.
Hart, kidneys, or liver?
A bit of everything.
- Cigarette?
- I don't smoke anymore.
That's good, healthier.
What do you plan to do?
- That depends.
- On what?
Different things.
- Going back to laying bricks?
- I'd like to, but I can't.
Well then?
I'll find something. There are lots of building trades.
You and construction!
Why don't you stay here?
- No, we're leaving.
- Too bad.
Leaving's easy, but here she earns three times what a bricklayer does.
We'll make it somehow.
"Somehow."
Listen to me, prior to October, I was an important executive.
Sure you can leave if you want to. But why?
Look...
I have money, you have a background. A great background, solid documents, a name... and, of course, those four years. I propose a partnership.
What would I do, make sandwiches?
Of course not!
You'd handle matters in government bureaus.
What do you say?
In two years you'll have a car.
In four, a house.
And she'll spend her time gossiping.
Remember, you were a statue and you still are.
But it makes no sense anymore. The others stopped long ago.
Do you want to be the last?
All right, I'll leave you two alone so you can talk it over.
Come with me.
No.
Why not?
You really are... a huge statue, I'm just a whore.
If we left together... it would only confirm it.
What do you want me to do?
Do whatever you like.
Why don't you lie down...
What the hell is this?
Are you nuts?
... Beat it!
Please forgive us.
Thank you very much.
Are you leaving?
I see I'm too late.
- Did it go well?
- Your standard drinks.
- How did you know?
- Filmmakers know everything.
Well, well...
Just look at you!
Drunk again!
What do you think this is, America?
You know what the situation is.
Hanka, excuse me, could I have his address?
Your son's.
Leave Maciek alone.
A nightmare.
This architecture.
From the 1950s. Do you like it?
- I grew up with it.
- I see.
Wide streets. lots of greenery, simpler people.
I remember... trips into Krakow. In rubber boots... and blue work jackets.
Mr. Jodla...
Krakow and Nowa Huta have different buildings, are different cities.
What's your opinion?
If it were up to me, I'd leave the following in Krakow... the Old Market Square and the old Cloth Hall as reminders.
The rest would be nice apartment buildings.
There's lots of space in Nowa Huta. Krakow is crowded and cramped. People jostle each other in the streets...
Would you like to see a film about Birkut?
I'm making a film about him.
How is he doing?
I could've made a name for myself too...
The film's going to be about those times.
The period when Nowa Huta was being built.
Are you looking for sensation?
Was the work competition bad?
It's not about that...
Wait, do you see this city?
We built all of this.
Nowa Huta, June 18, 1976.
Wrap it up.
Thank you.
Is that everything?
Of the films, yes. We've still got... magnetic tapes.
Very... interesting.
- Where's the director?
- Out in the hallway.
That material's nothing. It's not convincing.
It'll never be edited.
You can't do this. A little bit of patience. A debut is always risky...
Please trust me on this one.
The film will be fine. It's an important film.
Magnetic tapes?
!
What the hell is this, radio?
What could I do?
I told you to watch her.
Please be quiet.
I'm working here and I not only cut and splice, I also think.
Not the way you ought to.
Why? ...
She's a bright girl and her material is good.
Very good.
I saw your work.
And?
Interesting.
Is that all?
It's a bit thin, though. Where's Birkut?
There wasn't time...
- Haven't you found him yet?
- Not yet.
About Birkut, without Birkut?
What about his son?
I'll find both of them. The film will be great.
I'll be honest with you. You've exceeded your limits.
We support young artists, but we're not a charity.
No more film or cameras.
Are you nuts?
How am I going to finish it?
We'll make two stories for the evening news out of it.
What?
!
What the hell are you talking about?
It's great material!
This is do or die for me!
But not for me. I have two programs every day.
The audience can't start taking me for granted.
And now they respect you?
Two weeks for sound and editing!
I must make this film and you have to help me!
I've already given materials, public money...
Let's make a deal.
OK, you turn in the cameras and materials... and we're square!
They took my film from me.
Oh God! ... Why?
No more film, no more cameras.
And I have some great material. Let's have a look at it.
I didn't find it earlier. It's never been shown.
Roll film, please.
People have never sung this song at a public rally before.
An interview with Mateusz Birkut.
Mateusz, we're from Polish Newsreel and we'd like to ask...
Another circus?
We're just doing our jobs.
What is it?
Your village suffered greatly under the distortions of socialism. The people still bear a grudge. They'll vote only if you do so.
I know, that's why I'm here. Out of necessity.
Where's the election commission?
Neighbors, it was a dumb idea, but it's too late now.
You suffered so much injustice. Are you going to vote?
We're waiting.
People... there've been good times and bad times... but it's our country.
Comrades...
Maciek!
We were looking for young Birkut, but his name's Tomczyk.
Please send this material to my editing room.
We've been ordered to hold it.
Maybe you botched it.
Well?
It's not finished.
Maybe you lied a little.
You know, in films...
No, dad.
Maybe it was boring.
Was it honest?
Yes.
Then they have to allow it.
No they don't.
Why not?
They don't want this film.
They approved it and now don't want it?
Not any more.
But they invested money...
But not for this.
I don't get it, didn't they ask what it was for?
... Strange people.
They got scared.
Of what?
Everything.
Nobody's afraid of everything.
If you're afraid, it's of one thing.
What is it?
I don't know.
Then find out.
How?
Find that Birkut of yours.
They took away my cameras and film.
And without those you can't do it?
What for?
If they were making a film about me, I'd expect a visit.
That's normal.
Well?
Are you just going to lie there?
I'll eventually get up.
Grab your shoes and bag.
What for?
I've already told you. If the film was about me...
Go find him and talk to him.
- Then come back and tell me.
- Tell you?
That's right.
I want to know how it ended.
Go on.
You've got a bus in half an hour.
I've made a cherry liqueur.
It'll be ready soon.
- We'll have a drink.
- I don't drink.
Well, since it's with cherries...
- Is Tadek still in the army?
- He was just sworn in.
- Did you go?
- Sure.
It was nice. Tadek's really grown up.
I went to mom's grave. Nice flowers you planted.
- You getting married?
- What for?
I'm the only one you can be honest with.
Wait a minute...
Buy yourself some new clothes. You'll never find a guy in those.
THE LENIN SHIPYARDS
- GDANSK
Excuse me, Mr. Tomczyk?
That's right.
What is it?
You're Mateusz Birkut's son?
Yes, so what?
I'm looking for your father.
I've making a film about him.
You?
That's not important now. I'd just like to meet him... and talk to him.
What is it you want?
Your father's address.
He's dead.
Excuse me...
I knew you wouldn't get lost!
CISKE THE RAT
I don't want anybody's pity they can all drop dead, for all I care.
The only person that I long for is my dad, and he's never there.
The teachers at school are down on me, they say I drive them nuts.
The other children don't want to play, they hate my guts.
My ma is a nasty piece of work, beats me whenever she can.
She scolds like a fishwife, all day long, and fools around with all kinds of men.
My father did the best he could, when he walked out her loveless door.
I miss him more than I can say, but I have to wait 'til his ship's ashore.
I wish I had someone to care fore.
And someone who'd care for me.
To love and hug me, and protect me,
I feel as lonesome as can be.
I hope that when my dad returns, he'll take me with him to the sea.
And even if I'll have to slave, I'll be as happy as can be.
Dam nit, I'm just a little kid, I am too young to mend my ways.
I need some help, from anybody, but who would help a hard-boiled case like me.
I wish I had someone to care for.
And someone who'd care for me.
To love and hug me, and protect me,
I feel as lonesome as can be.
To love and hug me, and protect me,
I feel as lonesome as can be.
Did you fix my sandwiches ?
Listen, I'm not your servant!
There's a postcard from your father.
Bye, Auntie.
Don't slam the door, will you?
Why can you never be on time?
One of the barrels in the cellar hes leaked.
Take a cloth with you.
Three beers, two genevers.
Hey, doll... Two beers, with a punch. And have one on me, yourself.
Is that your husband ?
Maybe.
Cis!
Get a move one!
Henri. What's keeping you ?
I'd like to get to know you a bit better.
You rotten little bugger!
Damnit! God damnit!
Little viper!
I'll kill you one of these days!
You look a real mess.
I can't have you here like that.
I'll go home in a minute.
Money doesn't grow on my back!
Apologize, do you hear! ?
-Tomorrow!
Little viper.
Drop dead!
Whore!
I'm going to tell my dad.
Rotten bitch!
Help!
Chris!
Help!
Help!
Chris!
Chris, do something!
Marie... the children!
Oh, help!
Help!
Freimuth!
Brave, aren't you ? Against a little chap.
Hey, copper! -Come along, Rat.
We're going to see Mr. van Loon.
You can't set things on fire just like that.
Is that what she said ?
The rotten bitch!
That's no way to talk about your mother.
But, I'm right.
If my Dad was here
Sure, sure. But first learn to keep your big mouth shut, okay?
Ciske... you're leaving home for a while.
The father away, the better.
You see... what sort of little angel he is ?
I fear, madam, that you'll have to come here with your husband.
Perhaps we can find a solution together.
This is Mr. Peeksma.
Your guardian during the time that you're here.
Cis Freimuth.
What's all this ?
Shut up!
Hurry up!
The lights will go out in five minutes.
You'll sleep in the third bed from the back.
Hurry up...
Claus, what are you doing ?
His suitcase is busted, sir.
Come on.
Into bed.
Get on with it.
You can unpack tomorrow!
Hurry up!
That will do!
hey, what's your name ?
Silence!
Hey, what's your name ?
Freimuth!
Hands above the blankets.
Above the blankets!
Drop dead, you bastard.
Are we playing soccer, or what are we playing ?
All right, my friend.
Over here with that ball.
A free kick for you.
Hey...
Why doesn't that man simply take off his dress.
That would be a lot easier.
Sure, but the Pope won't allow it.
Who is that ?
That'll be the last time!
Time for a break.
Good for you.
Nobody can beat you.
You want something from me ?
Brave, aren't you ? Against those little chaps.
You wouldn't have such an easy time of it with me.
You think you're scaring me ?
Hey, do you really think you can tackle him ?
Will you take my place in the game ?
Come, we'll ask the Chaplain.
Can he play instead of me, Chaplain ?
All right by me.
I'm Chaplain de Goey.
And you're ?
Cis Freimuth.
Cis..?
From Franciscus ?
What brought you here ?
Oh, a row with my mother.
You don't have to tell me, you know.
Let's see what you're worth.
Silence!
Cis Freimuth, come here!
Well. How about it!
Stick out your hands.
If there's any beating to be done around here. we'll do the beating.
And now, enjoy your dinner.
Well... have a look at this one. And what do you think when you see it ?
Well, try and make up a story about it.
There once was a man and a women.
Yes.
And then ?
Well ?
They wanted to know what the sea looked like.
Hmm...
And what happened then ?
How would I know ?
Well...
Then we'll try the next one.
What do you think of this ?
Well ?
There once was a girl and she lost her doll.
How did that happen ?
Because her mother had thrown it out.
Fine.
And this one ?
What do you think when you look at it ?
I don't know.
Comrades!
Don't let yourselves be fooled any longer!
Mussert's got to go!
Read "The Torch" and gather at our place on Sunday... all of you.
Frank van der Goes will speak!
Get out here!
Hi, Theo.
Open that door!
Hey, Rat, keep your cool.
Look who we've got here.
Hi, mother.
Welcome home, my boy.
Sit down, please.
Can I offer you a drink ?
No, thank you.
Did he behave on his way home ?
As quiet as a lamb.
Am I interrupting ?
-Not at all.
I'm so very glad you were good enough to go and get him, eh, Cis ?
Where you able to arrange things with that new school ?
He can start straight away.
But they didn't dance for joy.
The head is sure a real prig!
I just hope he can get along with him.
Ah, if you help him a bit, it'll be all right, eh, Cis ?
Keep your pecker up, Rat.
You know what you promised me,
I'll let myself out.
There, that's one I still owed you.
Hey, doll. I wouldn't mind a beer now.
Hurry up, children. Hurry up!
Are you Mr. Bruis ?
Bruis.
Someone's asking for you.
What can I do for you ?
I am Cis Freimuth.
My mother said I would be in your grade.
Ah, that's right.
Remember me telling you about that lady ?
Oh, then you're the boy with the inkwell.
We run a respectable school here. I hope you behave yourself.
Come...
Teacher. That's the rat, who's been in prison lately.
To your seat!
Ciske.
Ciske, you're sitting next to Keith.
Teacher, I don't want him to come and sit next to me.
And why don't you want him to sit next to you ?
John, you keep out of this!
Go and sit next to Gerard. Get moving!
Are you comfortable ?
What did you say ?
-Yes.
Yes, what ?
-Yes, teacher.
Exercise books.
Jailbird.
Leave him alone. What's he done to you ?
Where do you live ?
Hey, rascal.
Father!
Ciske!
Look at that.
You're almost like brothers.
And now I want an ice cream.
Going whole hog.
Coming now, monkey ?
What's her name ?
Jane.
What does she know about me ?
A lot.
-A lot ?
Now open it.
Well ?
Didn't they have smaller ones ?
Give it to me.
Thanks a lot.
What's her reason for wanting you to stay ashore ?
She can't do it without me.
What sort of work will you do then ?
I'll take what I can get.
But how about having a chat with your mother first ?
She'll be pissed off again about me being late.
Kept in school again ?
It's my fault that he's so late.
Oh, look what the cat dragged in.
Delightful...
How are you doing ?
You're looking well.
Thank you.
Can I offer you a drink ?
I'll have a beer.
I've heard that you got yourself a new boyfriend.
From Ciske ?
Ah... children are always imagining things.
Not that I give a damn.
Cheers!
Your good health.
What would you say about us getting divorce ?
What's the use of staying married to me... when you can get ten others for each finger on your hand ?
I'm no use to you anyway.
You pay me something thought.
After the divorce, I'll give you alimony each month.
I've never noticed you being so generous.
What's in it for you ?
Nothing, except Cis.
And you wouldn't mind getting rid of him.
Have a good think about it.
I certainly will.
Rascal.
My husband wants a divorce.
Shall I do it ?
What do you think ?
Divorcing ?
You'd be crazy to do it.
And what if I meet some nice guy who wants to marry me ?
Then there's time to think about it.
Hey... you're doing all right this way.
Unless you've already got someone in mind, of course.
Well... uh, no.
Hey, Marie.
How about doing your gabbing on your own time ?
Your money each month and as free as a bird in the sky.
You want to give up all of that ?
They're all over the city now, fighting and rioting.
It seems they've already shot and killed one of them.
They ought to wring that Colijn's fat neck.
The bastard!
Oh yeah ?
And what would you know about it ?
This country needs a strong man.
Not gadabouts who are afraid of making decisions.
For a real leader you have to go to Germany.
Yes.
At least they know how to deal there with that work-shy scum.
Complaining that the wife and kids have nothing to eat. but hanging around all day in the bar themselves.
Isn't it bedtime for that kid ?
He's about had it.
Cis ?
Go home.
The police force couldn't manage in the end.
They were obliged to call in the army.
They're always picking on the poor folk.
The rich keep getting richer. It's the same everywhere.
Once you're on the dole you pull at the shortest end.
Rat, you with us ?
I hit him.
Freimuth, De Hahn!
Come along.
Hi.
Bennie!
I've been so worried about you, son!
Well, better late than never.
Keep your son off the streets at night in the future, De Hahn.
If I ever see him again, he'll be sent to reform school!
Over my dead body!
Better still!
You to kingdom come and your son to reform school.
We'd be moving into a real good direction.
Rat, stay here.
Have you been going into politics too these days ?
All I did was help them a bit.
The juvenile judge, Mr. van Loon, will sit up to learn you're now spending nights here.
Or do you think he won't find out about it ?
Come along, I'll take you home.
Then I can have another chat with your mother as well.
She'll beat the hell out of me.
Then you'll deserve it for once.
Mrs. Freimuth ?
Where have you been all bloody night ?
Where! ?
With us!
He was arrested in the riots.
You can consider yourself lucky he's still alive, four people were killed.
What's a boy of eleven doing on the street at night anyway ?
Can't you even make him stay home ?
I thought he'd gone to bloody bed!
She's lying her head off!
Don't you give me any cheek!
I don't know what I'm going to do with that boy.
I just don't know.
If you keep leaving him to his own devices, we'll take him off your hands forever at some point.
You'll be rid of him once and for all.
You know very well I've got to cope all by myself.
I try my hardest... but I simply can't manage him.
Yes, yes, I've noticed.
You'll be hearing from us.
Rat!
Dorus will be in our grade for a while, 'til we find out how far he's dropped behind.
Thank you.
Look, everybody...
Dorus is back again.
Teacher, he's not going to be in our grade, is he ?
Would you shut your big mouth, John!
He's got bad glands and that's infectious!
Do you know what's infectious ?
That great big mouth of yours.
We'll get it before long!
He can come and sit beside me.
The Rat is crazy!
Leave the room!
Ciske the Rat.
Exercise books.
Keith!
Is that a hat you've got ?
Keith!
Why wear that chimney pot ?
Keith has on his noddle.
His high silk hat it makes him glad.
Is that a hat you've got ?
It really beats the lot.
Keith has on his noddle.
His chimney pot, he looks an ace.
That monkey face.
Well done, Keith.
Cis. There now.
I am a decent youngster.
I'm always neat and spruce.
And when the weekend comes around, I'm always neat and spruce,
The district takes a dim view.
of my Sunday walk around.
And all the boys will gang up through the streets will sound.
Ciske!
Is that a hat you've got ?
Ciske!
Why wear that chimney pot ?
Ciske has on his noddle.
His high silk hat, it makes him glad.
Is that a hat you've got ?
It really beats the lot.
Ciske has on his noddle.
His chimney pot, he looks an ace.
That monkey face.
Stay there, it's me.
Now then, this is Aunt Jane.
Hello, Ciske.
And what do you think of her ?
Hello, madam.
I've got to go now, dad.
Hey, rascal!
You must give him a bit more time, Cor.
What'll we do if she refuses ?
You just leave that to me.
Hi, Theo, my old chum.
I haven't got any time.
I've only come to bring you the papers.
What sort of papers ?
The document for our divorce or have you already forgotten ?
Who says I want a divorce ?
But we talked about it, didn't we ?
Take it back again! I won't consider it!
Stop being so difficult, woman.
I've never made things difficult for you either.
That would have been the last straw!
Oh yeah ?
Well, with this thing here. I'm sure I had no hand in that.
And that brat there is very likely not a Freimuth either!
Eh, old chum ?
You let everybody screw you, don't you ?
How dare you!
I've never looked at another man yet!
I've right on to you!
But I warn you... if you have an affair with someone else and I find out, then you won't get another cent!
Get out!
And I won't let you see Ciske again either!
Don't let it get you down, rascal.
You stay right here!
We'll see who the boss is around here.
Is my father with you ?
No. He stepped out for a minute.
When could I come and live here ?
If you wait a moment, you can ask him yourself.
I'm in a hurry.
Say hello from me to him.
Bye.
Let that rat drop dead and come with us.
I don't want to go with you guys at all.
Leave him alone!
He hasn't done you any harm!
Shut up, you nitwit!
John, let him go!
Stop it!
John, let him go. Lay off him.
Do I have to go to a different school again ?
It's not unlikely.
Why did you have to reach for a knife ?
Couldn't you manage it with your bare hands ?
I don't want to go to another school.
You're not going to tell me that you're happy here ?
I don't know.
I'll see what I can do for you.
I wouldn't dream of it!
I won't let our good atmosphere be ruined by that little juvenile delinquent!
Maatsuyker, you were aware of his background when you enrolled him here.
Then you can't send him away just like that.
That very much remains to be seen!
I'm taking it up with the school inspector.
Do what you feel you must do.
Don't forget that I'm the head of this school!
You'd do well to realize that...
Inspector!
I've never seen that man get so angry.
Old fool.
Instead of him packing off that miserable John Verkerk, the Rat cops the lot again!
But it's not all true what you said, is it ?
He can just kick the Rat out of school.
Of course he can.
But I can give it a try, can't I ?
The Rat likes it here.
Am I mistaken, or are you really fond of him ?
Is that so strange ?
You could help him.
The juvenile judge wants a guardian for Ciske.
Interested ?
Me ?
Why not ?
You kill two birds with one stone.
Maatsuyker can't get rid of him and Ciske gets a guardian who'll do him some good.
What'll it be ?
Mrs. Freimuth ?
I'm Ciske's teacher.
My name is Bruis.
What has he been up to this time ?
I've only come to introduce myself.
Well!
I've been asked if I want to become Ciske's guardian.
Guardian!
Marie!
Get me my order!
Why don't I know anything about that ?
Hello, doll.
Same as usual.
You seem very busy.
Oh well, I'll go if you like.
Uh... it's coming up.
There you are, Mr. Oosterban.
A friend of my husband's.
What's Ciske doing here ?
Easy to see.
You stay there and clean up that mess! Hurry up!
Let that boy go.
That'll come off your pay, Marie.
Who do you think you are ?
- Come.
Stay here!
Stay!
You stay here!
You know that child labor is forbidden, don't you ?
Can't you tell my own child what do do anymore ?
Ciske is coming.
If not, the police will be at the door in half an hour.
She's always told me that he's already turned 14.
Little traitor!
I'll teach you to fink on your mother!
I've never said nothing at all!
But Reynard is a real rascal, he knows that. He's cunning, ingenious and scorns everything and everyone.
But that he's not keeping his date, that -
Shhh...
Ciske..?
Did you get to bed on time ?
Something wrong ?
I'd really like to help you.
Everything's all right.
SUPPORT THE CRISIS COMMITTEE.
Hey, Rat.
Hello, mum.
- Hello.
Hello.
Can we come in a minute ?
To ask you something ?
Of course.
Hello, daddy.
There you are.
Lovely.
Thanks very much.
Have a look at what I got.
You know what I think of it.
Please, sir. We'll really take very good care of him.
I'd love to go.
Please, Job.
Well, if you make very sure that he doesn't catch a cold.
That's enough!
Get dressed, hurry up!
Hop to it!
Get dressed, you lot.
Come on! Quickly!
You okay, Dorus ?
It's so beautiful here.
I'm glad I was allowed to come.
Lunch time.
Who wants a sandwich ?
Catch, catch, catch, catch.
There he is.
Bastards!
Carrot top!
I'll get you one day!
Can you see Cis ?
- No.
Ciske, come and look who's standing there.
Dad!
Look, Dorus!
That's my Aunt Jane.
Dad!
Hey, rascal.
Did you have a nice time ?
Hi, Dorus.
Yes, rascal.
I would have wanted it different, too.
But we'll have to put it off for a while.
When I get back, we'll see what we can do.
Perhaps she will changed her mind by that time.
I don't think so.
I'll write to you often.
Well, I best be going.
Bye, Aunt Jane.
I'll see you to the door.
Promise me that you'll be extra nice to Aunt Jane.
She's expecting a baby, you see.
Now do you understand why we want to get married as soon as possible ?
You can help us.
Is she still seeing much of that Henn ?
More and more. And now he's staying the night, too.
Excellent!
Now if you keep a tap on how often he comes and when, then we've got proof and then she can't stop the divorce any longer.
Shall I also have a look at what they're up to in the bedroom ?
No, no.
Don't do anything like that! Imagine them noticing.
Eh, Ciske ?
You can count on me, dad!
Dorus ?
Are you feeling all right ?
What are you reading ?
"Gulliver's Travels." Enjoying it ?
You're feverish.
I'm not sick.
You should be home in bed.
I don't want to be sick anymore.
Ciske.
Will you go and get Mrs. Keulemans,
Dorus isn't feeling well.
You can see him a moment now.
Dorus...
Get out of here!
Ciske.
He might be at the police station for all you know.
Ah, no.
He's probably with his father's chippy.
What did you say ?
Everybody around here knows.
That Cor's got something with the laundrywoman... in the Czar Peter Street.
You could knock me down with a feather.
Why else did you think he was pressing you for a divorce ?
If you're right...
Why don't you go and have a look ?
Henri... ?
Go on, I'll kept him occupied a moment.
Give me back my kid.
Mrs. Freimuth ?
I don't want my kid mixing with a woman like you!
Ciske ?
He'll come himself.
Ciske ?
You're going along with your mother.
And don't worry about Dorus now, I'm sure he'll soon feel better.
Go on now.
Look at that.
Would you believe it ?
!
And you'll leave him alone in the future, do you hear ?
Mrs. Freimuth...
Ciske needs a bit of love, just like everyone else.
If you don't give it to him, I will...
Now get out!
I hope you didn't mind having to wait a few minutes.
I had charming company.
Where's Ciske ?
He's gone to bed.
Are we doing something nice ?
I've taken all evening off for you.
Then it'll be a long night.
Tomorrow I'll treat you to a lovely breakfast, in bed.
You'd better watch out... so that sweet little son of yours doesn't hear us.
He doesn't notice anything.
You're always so nice to me.
You're a real tasty dish, you are.
Why don't you take that off ?
Marie!
Look at this!
What do you want ?
-Damnit!
Were you watching your own mother ?
You dirty, little bugger.
You're sure a silly bloody cow. He's bound to tell on you.
Cis' ? He'll keep his mouth shut.
Swine that you are.
Let me go!
Nobody has given you any rights.
Just leave him to me.
Bye, Madam.
-See you later.
Hi, Cis.
Hey, hello!
What's the matter ?
Show me.
How did that happen ?
My mother and her friend.
Can't you talk to her ?
It can't go on like this.
Talk ?
I'll have her deprived of her parental rights.
Why did she do it ?
Ciske's father had asked him to uh... he had asked him to keep an eye on the sort of people who visited his mother.
He sort of took it a bit literally.
You mean, uh...
Yes, in that case, I fear there's little I can do.
You go into the classroom, Ciske.
If you really love Ciske so much, Then please leave him alone.
He's got to learn to manage with his mother.
Keith, which town is this ?
Haarlem.
Keith, try again.
Then it's the Hague.
Keith, it ends with "dam".
Rotterdam!
You don't live in Rotterdam, do you ?
Keith, where do you live ?
Czar Peter Street 83, 2nd floor.
Mr. Maatsuyker...
Bruis, come along a moment.
We will be quiet, take a book and read for a moment.
And you, sit down.
Hey, Rat, did you run into a street pole ?
Kids... I've got very bad news.
Dorus Keulemans... died this morning.
Yes ?
I want to say something to Mrs. Keulemans.
I think it's awful...
If you hadn't been pushing that school trip, he might never have gotten sick!
You shouldn't say that, Job!
Dorus has asked me to give you this.
He loved you very, very much.
Would you like to say good-bye to him ?
Dorus is dead.
I think you'd better go home, or you'll be in trouble again.
Cis, you shouldn't come for while.
What a coincidence.
I'd been planning to come and see you this afternoon.
Come in.
You won't believe me... when I tell you what that miserable rat did just now!
Mrs. Freimuth... why don't you simply agree to the divorce ?
It's none of your business.
It's not pleasant for you either... these quarrels all the time.
Why keep up your obstructions ?
Or do you resent them getting married before the child arrives ?
Oh, Chris, will you see who it is ? I'm beat.
Oh, you silly twit.
Get out of here before I throw you out!
You seem to forget, I'm Ciske's guardian.
You can stuff your guardian bit up your ass!
And as that school of yours, he won't be back!
If Ciske isn't at school tomorrow, I'll call the police.
Do as you like!
And bug off!
Hi, doll. How about it ?
Tell me, how do I look, huh ?
Hey, lay off, will ya!
Where're we going ?
I thought that you loved me.
I'm not a whore, you know...
It's just for once.
What are you whining about, Marie...
You like it, don't you ?
Come on. I'm not asking you to do anything dreadful, am I ?
You can earn a pile of money with it.
Hey, doll, you're not going to look any better you know, with all that crying.
Yes, one moment...
Well, what'll it be... Yes, or no ?
I can get a dozen others instead of you, dumb broad!
FOR PEACE AND DISARMAMENT!
AGAINST WAR AND FASCISM
Why do you always scorch the leftovers ? !
You've got it in for me, too, haven't you ?
Nobody's gonna waltz over me!
Move, you're in the way!
Why is it always such a bloody mess here ?
Ah, get stuffed, you bitch!
Why don't you play whore for Henri ? !
Off to bed with you.
Didn't you hear me ?
Get to bed, I said.
Get cracking!
Look out!
Don't, please!
Give it back!
Rotten bitch!
Give it to me.
Chris!
Marie!
Marie!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Aunt Jane!
Aunt Jane!
Cis, what's wrong ?
What's up, Cis ?
What's the matter ?
Maybe she's dead.
Surely it won't be as bad as all that.
You can lie down in my bed for now, warm up a bit... then I'll go and see what has happened.
She can go.
Cis...
Cis...
Wake up now.
Come, Sweetheart.
You have to get dressed.
Your mother is dead.
I don't want to.
Aunt Jane, I'm so scared.
Ciske, the time's come.
You need to ?
Regulations, Sir.
JUVENILE KILLER GETS MAXIMUM SENTENCE
Get rid of that newspaper.
I don't know what to say...
When they let me out, can I come and live with you and Aunt Jane ?
Course! And I'm not leaving you again.
Come, young Freimuth.
Leave him.
I wish I had done away with her myself.
That wouldn't have been much help.
Will he ever get over it ?
Nobody knows.
This is the smallest size.
Good luck.
Quiet, Antonissen!
-Yes, Sir.
You'll report after supper.
Yes, Sir.
Prisoner Freimuth.
Cap... off!
Cap... off!
We're not at all fond of people who pull knives.
Yes, Sir.
The judge has been very lenient with his six months as far as I'm concerned.
Yes, Sir.
You try and play up just once and I'll see to it that your stay here will be damned unpleasant.
Understood ?
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Vergeer!
Would you remove this vermin from my room ?
Cap... on!
Where's your spoon ?
I don't know.
If you lose your spoon once more, you'll be eating with your fingers from that time on.
Yes, Sir.
Look straight ahead!
Mother killer.
Mother killer.
Mother killer.
Murderer... murderer...
murderer... murderer... murderer...
Leave me be, you bastards!
Stop it!
Bugger!
You buggers!
You buggers -
What's going on here ?
He hit me all of a sudden.
His bucket fell over.
Mop it up!
- No!
Mop it up!
- No!
Visser!
Buer!
Take over.
It wasn't Freimuth's fault -
Shut up!
We'll break you of these bad habits.
Attention!
I'd like to see him alone for a minute.
I hadn't expected to find you here.
Mr. Chaplain ?
Ciske, wasn't that your name ?
How could it happen ?
I don't want to talk about it.
Not with me, either ?
You're Ciske's guardian ?
I'm de Goey.
We do our best to create a bit of a pleasant atmosphere here.
Please, sit down.
I'm glad you found a moment to come.
How is he doing ?
Could be better.
He desperately clings to the thought that he'll be going to live with his father and his aunt afterward.
So... you'll understand that your letter was a bit of a shock.
I don't think that it'll ever be solved between those two.
And what's to become of Ciske then ?
Then he'll have to find his own way.
Have you had a talk with her ?
Yes. But... she won't build her future on the death of another.
Shall we go and have a look ?
Gosh... twins.
My dad will be real proud.
How is everyone at school ?
Bettie wants to know when you think you'll be back.
Mr. Maatsuyker won't let me stay on at school anymore...
I guess.
It's for the best, they know so much about you there.
What are the boys like here ?
I've got one friend.
The others play beastly tricks.
And you don't join in, I suppose ?
Inside, Freimuth.
Time's up.
Yes, Sir.
I'll say hello to everyone for you.
You may be satisfied with your ward, he's making good progress.
He is already quite a different boy than the insolent, undisciplined tough one we received here.
I want to see the Governor!
I want to go home!
I want to go home!
I want to see the Governor!
I want to see the Governor!
If you don't let me go, then I'll jump!
You silly fool!
You don't have the guts for it.
I'm jumping!
I'd sooner die than spend another day in this place.
Frans!
Nothing of the sort!
Mr. Reinders, in the name of God.
Let me talk with him.
I wouldn't think of it.
I refuse to be blackmailed.
You got everything ?
Yes, Sir.
And remember, Ciske...
You've done your time and it's all over. Forever.
Even Aunt Jane doesn't want me anymore.
I'm sure that she still loves you very, very much.
I don't think so.
We can't always have things the way we want them, Ciske.
You must know that by now.
Freimuth!
All the best.
Yes, Sir.
Show them that you're a man.
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Bruis...
Chin up.
Hi, dad.
Hi, rascal.
Won't you come in a minute ?
Why don't you go to the Crisis Committee some time ?
That's what they're for.
Would you like something to drink ?
No, my wife is waiting for me.
I could never have managed without you.
We'll keep in touch.
And if there's anything, be sure to let me know.
Bye, Cis...
And as soon as I've got you another school, you'll hear from me.
Good afternoon to you. I'll see myself out.
Bye.
Hungry ?
It's not much, is it ?
But until I've found a job, we'll have to manage like this.
I didn't even have enough money to come and get you.
Where are Theo and Corry ?
In Rotterdam, with your aunt.
Hey, Bennie!
Ciske!
Cis!
This is little Ko...
Hi, Ko.
And this is little Cathy.
Hi, Cathy.
Come, they have to go to sleep.
Why don't you want to marry my father anymore ?
Is it because of me ?
Have you got another man then ?
It's got nothing to do with you, Ciske.
It's something between Cor and me.
I feel that he treats everything so...
Well, it's got nothing to do with you.
Can I come and see you again ?
'Course! 'Course!
Keep that dog with you!
Ah, fathead!
That dog isn't even mine.
Hey, what's your name ?
Hey, go home!
Go home!
How did it go today ?
Nothing... as usual.
Here, Buddy.
Where did you get him ?
He followed me.
Yes, but the animal can't stay here, Cis!
We've hardly anything to eat ourselves.
Ah, it's only a small one, he's sure not to eat much.
Well, all right then.
But you'll take care of him yourself.
Dad, have you seen the twins yet ?
See you later.
Little Ko and little Cathy.
Aunt Jane said they look a lot like you.
Coming.
I've forgotten my purse.
You shouldn't have done that, Cis.
I asked him to.
I want you to go away.
I want both of you to go!
Hey, you guys. The Rat!
Hello, Bettie.
Hello, Sip.
Cis, are you back ? - Murderer!
Shall I walk home with you ?
My parents don't want me to see you anymore.
I don't want to see you around here anymore.
Get away from here!
There he is!
I'm in luck.
Hey, Rat!
What do you want ?
Filthy mother-killer!
I can't swim, help!
I've had it.
Hey, rascal.
Aunt Jane ?
Thanks, Mr. Maatsuyker.
There was a time I had no faith in you.
But now I'm proud of you.
Bravo!
Mr. Maatsuyker!
You're forgetting the most important thing.
And you'll be coming back to our school, of course.
Hurrah!
Cis... okay ?
Do you promise, each and all, to desire to fulfill all the duties that are connected to the lawful marital state ?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Then will you now, Bride and Bridegroom. give each other your right hand ?
Then I, Civil Servant of the Amsterdam registration service, declare that you've been joined in marriage.
Would you now come forward to place your signature ?
I won't do it!
Hendrick!
It's not going to work between us anyway.
What's all this, Hendrick!
- Hendrick!
I won't do it.
I don't feel like it!
Well, so you don't feel like it anymore!
You like the pleasures, but not the troubles, huh ?
Then you should have thought of that sooner!
Calm down! The moment that the hammer was dropped the marriage was legalized.
And what about my signature ?
- Hendrick!
I'll sign it myself, if need be!
Do as you like!
I'm off!
Would you stop that immediately!
Asshole!
I'm on my way.
Can the others be in the picture, too ?
Everyone ?
- Everyone.
For Cis!
Everyone in the picture.
Would you stop there, please ?
A bit closer together if you don't mind!
Yes.
Stand still!
Little dove that flew away, come, appease my yearning
Little dove i often kissed, let yourself be caught once more
My sweetest little dove, come, oh do come quickly
Longingly I think of you, fairest Rosalinde
This is what my sister Ida, who's a ballet girl, writes:
Tonight we are going to a villa where things are jolly and gay
Prince Orlofsky, the rich eccentric, is giving a grand supper lf you can get hold of a dress from your mistress I'll be happy to introduce you
Just get the evening off and I bet you will have lots of fun.
There you're never bored!
Well, so much for Ida's letter l have no doubt, I would love to go
But it's a tricky business lf only I knew how to get away!
Were I a certain little dove then I could fly to and fro happily sporting myself in the clear blue sky
Alas, why did fate make me a mere lady's maid?
Who's that singing?
Sounds to me like an opera-singer.
What's a singer doing out there?
Rosalinde?
That's an admirer! And not mine but my mistress's!
I must take a look at him lt's him!
It's Alfred! Jesus, Maria!
He's coming here!
Now that I'm married!
There'll be a scandal, or a duel I'm not at all well.
He's gone.
Ah!
Here's my mistress! Now out with the story. It's short but moving
Adele, what's the matter?
My aunt...
She's ill... my aunt is ill
Can't you help? Oh yes. I could go and ask how she's getting on
- Your poor sick aunt?
- Yes, and so I beg you to let me have this evening off.
Thank you very much
- lmpossible
- How, impossible?
You know perfectly well my husband begins his prison sentence tonight I can't help that
Can I help it if he gets five days for calling an official an idiot?
- Yes, and walloping him
- Adele! Pardon!
Slapping his face.
But the master has appealed
Yes, but that was no use. He goes to prison, and you stay here
- Oh, my poor aunt!
- Don't drive me mad!
I'll never see her again on earth!
Alas, I may not go and see you
Yet you are longing for me so your well beloved niece
What a tragic tale it all is
Alas, why did fate make me a mere lady's maid?
A pill like that settles one enormously
That aunt!
That Alfred!
- Why don't you fly into my arms?
- Because I'm married
But that doesn't matter to me
- Go away!
- Go, when I've just come?
I'm scared my husband will come Nobody's scared of your husband.
He's doing time!
"Too long have I tarried. The Grail summons me"
Don't sit down! My husband will be back for his things
Please, I beg you, leave me alone!
On one condition.
Promise I can return when you're alone
- lmpossible - Then, alas, I must stay
- l promise - l'll go
- Farewell
- No, no, not "farewell" Rosie, I may, mayn't I?
Bye-bye, divine delicacy!
I'm still crazy about his singing.
I must take another pill
My husband!
No, with such counsel you're stabbed in the back!
- lt makes you impatient!
- Just have patience! The business has taken a turn for the worse And that's all his fault!
- Whose fault is it?
- His fault? Yes, his and his alone!
- The lawyer's?
- That isn't true! - You'll see!
- What happened? Explain! - Listen!
- First I want to defend myself!
Save yourself the trouble, no defence is possible!
It seems you want to abuse me!
Keep calm! Why all this rage?
- Our lawyer pleads like a parrot!
- Herr Eisenstein started shouting!
- You stutter at every word!
- You quarrel all the time!
- You crow like a cockerel!
- You're a rude person!
- You're a blockhead!
- You are most unkind!
You're talking utter rot and inconsistently at that
But now spare your breath and let the matter rest
Sir, you'd better leave now or there will be a scandal
She is right, you'd better leave or there will be a scandal
- Sir, you'd better leave now!
Now calm yourself at last
You're sentenced, that's that
Just put up with it and in five days in a mere five days, the business will be over
Did you say five days?
Now it's gone up to eight! They added yet another three
That's all that fellow has achieved
Today I'm to report for jail, otherwise they'll come for me
That is too much, I must say!
Isn't it just?
Alas, my poor, poor husband, so you must leave tonight?
What can I say to comfort you?
However shall I endure this?
No, with such counsel you're stabbed in the back!
It makes you impatient!
And that's all his fault!
- Whose fault is it?
- Your fault! Yes, his and his alone!
When you're free again, we'll file another suit
Then I will show you what I can do
What can you do? Reclamation, appellation investigation, allegation Regulation, exoneration interrogation, corroboration
Arbitration, peroration lnnovation, intuition
Sequestration...
- Stop it now, that will do!
- Computation, attestation
And then you're bound to win!
No matter how much paper and ink you may waste in the process in the end you will only make a fool of yourself!
Yes, a fool!
Such a counsel's advice is not always sound and, my word, they try your patience!
The business has taken a turn for the worse And that's his fault and his alone!
- My poor Gabriel
- My poor Rosalinde!
They have given you three more days?
I have Dr. Stutterbuck to thank for the supplement l had to talk them round into giving me a little time for a farewell supper with you, my little mouse
Ha! The shock has gone to my stomach. I'm starving!
Adele, what's wrong?
You're crying.
Surely not for me?
My poor aunt is ill imagine, her aunt's dying again!
That's funny. I just met her and she was quite chirpy
That was certainly her last chirp.
I'll never see her again But you will. Now go to the Golden Hart and bring a sumptuous meal
- What do you want? - Listen. First, some soup
Then ( l have such common tastes ) black pudding, but only half And half a liver sausage.
Then fat roast pork, kale and crisp potato
You know what kale is, don't you? Cabbage!
These immigrant workers! Wait a minute!
Salzburg Nockerl, but watch it doesn't collapse!
And you, please fetch my oldest, most tattered suit
- Why?
- For prison, of course
- Dr. Falke - That idiot's all I need! Congratulations, my dear, on being free of the tyrant for eight days
And congratulations, Gabriel
Getting three more days requires exceptional patronage!
- Very witty!
- Don't make bad jokes, Doctor!
Try to cheer poor Gabriel up.
I'll fetch your clothes
- Be so good - Don't worry, loveliest of ladies
He'll be comforted
- What is it? I have something for you. I invite you to a grand supper tonight with fabulous women, at the villa of Prince Orlofsky
Orlofsky?
Who's he?
- The Champagne Orlofsky!
- l don't know him! The crazy young Russian magnate who tries to get rid of his money
The man can be helped! But my prison sentence?
Forget it!
Tonight you're coming with me to Orlofsky's
- He's invited the whole opera - The old guard, eh?
Yes, but also all the young ones, the girls in the corps de ballet
The ballet Rats?
Does the Prince actually know me?
No, but I've told him what a handsome young fellow you are...
Go on with you!
...and all the things we've done together
Remember the Schönbrunn masked ball?
You as butterfly, I as bat?
As long as I live.
I'll never laugh so much again
One doesn't forget something like that so easily
Don't you feel I should have revenge for that?
Revenge?
That involves two, one smart and one stupid
Yes, but don't count your chickens before they're hatched!
But what's the time? Where's the watch?
- Just wait a minute
- Ah! The famous Rat-catcher!
With this watch I've caught each and every one!
- You promise it to everyone
- But I've still given it to none
So you'll come? Come to the party with me, you won't have far to go!
Before you settle down to moping in that prison cell you must have a jolly time and be a gay spark!
Nimble ballet dancers, dazzlingly dressed will charmingly ensnare you to the polka's alluring strains!
Believe me, friend, you'll feel young again!
With intoxicating music and splendour galore with captivating sirens at the exquisite banquet time will slip away in merriment and you will forget your troubles lf prison is not to prove harmful you've got to do something to amuse yourself!
- Don't you agree?
But my wife must know nothing about this
You must kiss her most tenderly goodbye saying:
Fare thee well, my sweetest kitten Oh no!
My sweetest mouseking, I shall say!
Sweetest mouseking! For you yourself will be the cat when you creep out of the house And while she is soundly asleep instead of going to your old jail you'll be coming along to that heavenly party with me
I'll introduce you as a stranger
You will be Marquis Renard!
That way no one will find out.
Are you agreeable?
Oh well, I don't mind
- lt's your duty! - lf only...
You simply owe it to yourself
Just think of your health
Yes, I do believe you're right, it's not a bad excuse!
If prison is not to prove harmful I've got to do something to amuse myself!
- Are you coming, then?
- How can I resist? I'm coming!
The devil take your shilly-shallying!
Such a supper party was never seen before
What exquisite beauties! What a night of mirth and song!
He moved me and comforted me.
Now I'll go cheerfully to prison lt wasn't easy at first, but eventually it worked
- Here are your clothes
- What's this then?
- The clothes he wanted - He can't go to prison like that!
They'll put him with dangerous criminals and ruin the good man
He's right! We didn't think of that
My time is up. I kiss your hand, loveliest of ladies. I have to go
Give my regards to The Rats
- The rats?
- There are rats in every prison
- And if they bite you?
- Then I'll bite them back Falke was right.
One must serve a sentence immaculately dressed
Yes, in protest!
They can lock me up, but never degrade me
Be proud of me, little mouse I know how I'll be dressed!
He's crazy!
He seems happy to go to prison
One's off his rocker, the other's lost his wits!
If only I knew what to do with the first when the other is away
- Madam, here's the soup
- Put it down there Tell me, Adele, how is your poor sick aunt?
Who?
Oh yes, well... It keeps going the way it goes Are you quite sure this poor sick aunt isn't a healthy young cousin?
Madam, what are you thinking of?
Just that nieces have obligations.
You can have tonight off
But Madam refused earlier I was in a bad mood earlier, now I'm in a good mood
A fragrance rare floats through the air
Adele, the left foot The right foot
Now I'm scented, I'll absent myself
What? Without your supper?
When the rats overrule, watch your stomach's not full!
- An old Chinese proverb
- Oh, my poor Gabriel!
May sweet dreams surround you, while I waltz all night round you
- What? - l mean "watch round you"
In such a situation we have but one choice to perish in pain, or tear ourselves apart
Let's tear ourselves apart! So I'm to be left all alone, a whole eight days without you!
How can I put into words the awful sorrow I feel?
How will I find it possible to bear being separated from my husband?
Who have I to pour my heart out to?
O God, how this moves me! I will be thinking of you at breakfast wanting to pour your coffee.
I will see the empty cup and cannot even smile at you!
Overwhelmed by grief, I must drink mine quite unsweetened!
O God, how this moves me! O God, how this moves me!
Oh dear, how this moves me!
Gone will be the happy scene when luncheon-time arrives!
With no husband to partake of soup or steak or joint! And when night falls, again I'll feel a pang
My grief will then know no limits!
Oh dear, how this moves me!
Why moan? I'm nearly off my head!
- l feel quite dazed!
- And me all confused! Farewell, then I must leave!
Yet one sweet consolation remains! We'll surely meet again! We'll surely meet again!
O God, how this moves me!
Men!
He's going to enjoy himself enormously in prison
Who knows who else is there?
And I sit here, a lonely deserted wife, and pity him
- ls he in jail?
- Yes, he's in jail
A little refreshment.
That's nice! And considerate!
- Please, don't trouble yourself!
- You're right, I never do
- What are you doing then? - Making myself comfortable
Already? And in the master's dressing-gown!
Darling, aren't you pleased?
- l should be pleased?
- About tonight and tomorrow morning!
Breakfast! - Breakfast? - None of that awful white coffee
Something substantial, roast beef, caviar, hard-boiled eggs
Rosie, we'll need it I beg you, please leave now I kept my promise.
More you can't expect of me Rosie, once, just once!
Do you want to compromise the one you once held dear?
Of course not.
Wow! Tokay! - Perfect for a wedding night!
- Don't drive me crazy! It doesn't matter. Calm down, Rosie!
First we'll drink, then sing - And then... - Don't sing!
Drink dear, drink quickly, drink puts brightness in your eyes
Once your fair eyes are clear, you'll see everything as it really is
You'll see that passion is a dream that fools us again and again
You'll see that eternal devotion is a myth that exists no more Even if an illusion vanishes which once gladdened your heart wine comforts you by giving you oblivion!
Happy is the one who accepts what has got to be
Ding, ding, sing, sing, sing, drink with me, sing with me!
What's to be done?
Happy is the one who accepts what has got to be
He won't go away, maybe he'll fall asleep
Whatever am I to do? - Your health! - No, no!
Drink dear, drink quickly, drink puts brightness in your eyes
Do not frown, I beg of you, be merry and don't scold lf once you have been untrue, well, I'll forgive you
Just swear you love me again and I will not doubt you lllusion brings us happiness even though the joy is brief
Never fear, I believe you and am happy while today lasts! Happy is the one who accepts what has got to be
I hear voices!
- lt doesn't matter!
- My husband!
- lt doesn't bother me! - Disappear! I wouldn't dream of it!
Do not alarm yourself, madam l am prison governor Frank I couldn't deny myself the pleasure of escorting your guilty husband personally to his " rest cure"
But my husband is...
Drink dear, drink quickly, drink puts brightness in your eyes!
Please be quiet, we are not alone!
That doesn't bother me!
Ding, ding, sing with me, drink with me!
My carriage is waiting below and I hope you will come quietly No! Happy is he who accepts what has got to be!
Quite so! I see you are taking a humorous view of the situation Drink with me, sing with me!
You see, I can be jolly too
But now come along, Herr von Eisenstein!
What am I to do?
I'm not Herr von Eisenstein, I'm not the one you're looking for!
You are not?
Dash it all, no! There is no need to swear!
Pretend to be my husband now! Did someone pull the wool over my eyes?
Sir, what would you think of me if I were here with a stranger
By voicing doubts of that kind you cast aspersions on my honour indeed, you offend me
Does not this very situation clearly speak for itself?
Supping with me at so late an hour, in such intimate seclusion thus attired, without ceremony, who could it be but the spouse?
Supping with her at so late an hour in such intimate seclusion thus attired, without ceremony, who could it be but the spouse?
Looking like a pasha, you found him in his dressing-gown his cap upon his head
That this picture could raise the slightest doubt I would not have believed possible Just look at the way he is yawning and yearning for rest
In this tête-à-tête with me so late he has all but fallen asleep
These bored and blasê airs can only be those of a husband! In this tête-à-tête with her so late he has all but fallen asleep These bored and blasê airs can only be those of a husband!
You've dispelled my doubts, but I must be off now
Please kiss one another goodbye!
- A goodbye kiss? - A goodbye kiss! Well then, if I must...
If I must go to jail and take your husband's place I can also do his kissing for him
Come, sweetheart, kiss me once again!
Sir, I'm pressed for time, I'm expected at a party tonight
So do let's make a move at last!
You're bound to find my husband there
They may put us in the same cell
- Have pity on me! - Of course I will!
Follow me quickly, the carriage is waiting below
So let's be off, make haste!
My beautiful big bird-cage is not far from here
Many birds fly in and out and lodge there free
So may I now invite you, too, dear sir, to be my valued guest
Now, dear sir, just step this way!
If I must, I'll go along!
- But be discreet! - l will!
Now let's be off quickly! In a moment I'll submit to my fate, but first let me take leave again!
Enough, sir, that will do!
Just one more kiss, then I'll be brave! No, no, enough, it's time to part!
A kiss, to comfort me in my plight!
Enough of this farewell, sir, or we'll never get away
Enough, the time has come!
His beautiful big bird-cage is not far from here
Many birds fly in and out and lodge there free
Now he invites you, too, to be his guest
So please, do resign yourself, what must be must be
Fate decrees that I am to dine alone tonight I willingly resign myself to it
Why still indulge in vain quarrelling and lamentations? Away, then! What must be must be!
Such a supper party was never seen before
Only the best food and drink are ever served here!
All the rooms full of splendour seem like a dream to us
As though bewitched by magic all exclaim: How charming! How amusing, how entertaining!
Such a supper party was never seen before
Only the best food and drink are ever served here!
How quickly time flies here!
Surely no one could be bored
The motto of this place is sheer amusement!
- Adele! You! - Who else should I be?
- Have you a gentleman friend?
- Not yet. I've just come For God's sake, who invited you? - You did
- Me?
You wrote me a letter asking me to appear grandly dressed at the Villa Orlofsky
- Here I am
- Someone's played a joke on you
- A what? - A joke lf l catch them!
I make our aunt ill and bathe myself in tears to get away
Steal, rob!
I steal my mistress's best ball gown from the cupboard and then find somebody's played a joke on me. lt's so mean!
What do you plan to do now? You, a housemaid, in our society?
You're not so fine yourself, with your ballet to-do
Recently I saw you, fourth dwarf on the left, with such a beard!
- Without a beard!
- All right, what do we do now?
The Prince!
Quiet!
Tartars say: " Even the cleverest bear cannot lay eggs"
- Such a wit have I never...
Doctor, I can no longer laugh.
Everything bores me
- My millions are my misery
- That misery I would gladly share
- Nonetheless today you will laugh
- You think so?
I hope so. I've arranged a little dramatic joke for you
- What is the comedy called? - "The Revenge of a Bat"
Title good!
Ivan, vodka!
The young one is the Prince
- So young and a prince already!
- Youth doesn't protect the noble
The letter worked. There's one of my characters already
- The leading lady?
- No, rather the cunning soubrette
Highness, may I present Miss Olga, my sister
Olga?
That is a name from my country
- Do you speak Russian?
- Pardon?
No, it's too cold for me What have we here?
She's an artiste I love artistes, especially those who are up and coming
- Are you up and coming? - lt's coming on Roulette, Your Highness
Bah!
Ladies, perhaps with the contents of this wallet you would like to try your luck.
Winning bores me to death With the greatest of pleasure.
But what if we have bad luck?
I shall have the good luck to see you here again soon
- How do you like the Prince? - A lovely person!
Doctor, is Olga an artistic name? That depends.
Her name is Adele, and she is our hero's housemaid
- The Marquis Renard is our hero - Ah! Good, good!
Here I am. lt wasn't so easy to get away from my old lady
And I had to go the hairdresser as well.
How do you like my curls?
- Has the meal begun already?
- Don't worry, not yet
- lt's very chic.
Shall we start?
- l bid you welcome, Marquis My pleasure. Who's the boy then?
- The Prince Orlofsky
- Oops! Pardon me, Highness. I imagined a prince to be different somehow
Cossacks say: "One knows a horse not by its walk but by its oats"
Yes.
And by its "apples"
Humour, eh?
- Are you a man of honour?
- l can't complain
Then tell me on your honour, do you like vodka?
- When I must
- You must!
- Pardon? That doesn't help either.
Cheers!
Lucky Marquis!
Vodka still tickles you. I see you love it
Very much!
- Then drink another glass!
- l mustn't rob you Drink!
And then sit tight! Yes, yes.
Actually I should have been sitting tight long ago!
I have still to acquaint you with my national peculiarities I like inviting people to a party, my guests get nothing but the best
They're welcome to make merry, and often do until dawn l myself always have a boring time, no matter what they say or do
Yet what, as host, is my privilege, I will not tolerate from my guests
And if I see anyone being bored when he's at one of my parties I seize him without ceremony and kick him through the door
Do you wonder why I do that sort of thing?
Why then?
It's just a habit of mine. Chacun à son goût!
If the bored ones are thrown out, the guests will really have fun! When I drink wine with others and empty bottle after bottle everyone's thirst must match my own or else I lose my temper
As I go on filling glass after glass I don't stand for any argument I just can't abide it if you shout:
No more, I've had enough lf anyone refuses to drink, giving himself airs and graces I throw the bottle at his head
Do you wonder why I do that sort of thing?
It's just a habit of mine.
- Highness, everything's gone!
- All the better
That's Adele!
And in my wife's dress too!
May I introduce you.
Miss Olga, Miss Ida the Marquis Renard
- Now show us how you can act!
- Boldness be with me!
Marquis, you're pulling a devilishly foolish face
Doctor, I believe I shall laugh today after all
Tell me, Miss Olga, have you always been a Miss Olga?
Tell me, sir, have you always been a Marquis Renoir?
- This likeness!
- To whom, sir? If you insist to my housemaid
Ida! I'm going to have my " margarine" !
Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be fun! - You came at the right time! - What's happening?
Do tell us!
You see this fair young lady?
The Marquis thinks she is...
No, it's too funny for words! - Who is she then? - Guess!
He thinks I am a lady's maid, isn't that ridiculous?
Most ridiculous!
That's not very gallant of you, sir!
What a blunder to make!
How ungallant!
The likeness is too striking! How ungallant! No wonder it confused me!
My dear Marquis, a man like you ought to know better than that
Let me therefore advise you to look at people more closely
My hand is too tiny to behold, my foot too small and graceful!
My speech, so refined, my dainty waist and elegant figure
You'll never find a lady's maid who has these things!
You must admit that your mistake was a very funny one indeed!
Yes, very funny indeed is the matter!
Yes, very funny indeed is the matter!
You are very funny, Marquis! By nature was I endowed with this profile of Grecian cut lf my face is not evidence enough, please look at my figure!
Then, through your lorgnette, kindly examine the way I dress I honestly believe love blurred your sight
The vision of that fair lady's maid holds your heart enthralled!
So now you see her everywhere, truly a very funny thing to happen!
Yes, very funny indeed is the matter!
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been laughed at enough for my mistake I solemnly beg your pardon, before all the guests and His Highness
Granted.
But in future watch out for pretty maids, luv!
Chevalier Chagrin?
- The Prison Governor, Frank - Ah, good, good!
Dear Chevalier, I bid you heartily welcome on behalf of His Highness
Forgive me for being a little late, Your Highness
Don't trouble yourself.
My guests are at home here
May I introduce you.
Chevalier Chagrin... the Marquis Renard
They're compatriots then! Good! - He's not going to speak French?
- Yes, why not?
- Say something! - But what?
I want outsi! François Chagrin
Grande toilette! Toilette? Grande?
Second door on the left
- But that's English
- God, I can speak English too! Marquis, we don't understand a word
We'd much rather have German "conservation"
I don't like speaking with a compatriot in "Germaine" but if the ladies absolutely insist, " pas de quoi"
- Have you been long hereabouts? - Just three days
- Haven't you met yet?
- No, I seldom appear in public
- l move more in closed circles
- But I hope we meet again soon
Perhaps as soon as tomorrow!
What will they say when they really know each other? Highness, can't we eat yet? I'm starving!
We are still waiting for a highly interesting lady a Hungarian countess who has had to take certain precautions
- Probably married, poor thing!
- Yes, to a jealous old ass How stupid husbands are!
For this reason the poor lady will appear in a mask I beg you, ladies and gentlemen, to respect it
The Kalmucks say: "As long as the nightingale sings one must plant the asparagus"
Tonight we have plenty of time
What a lovely little watch!
Maybe tonight I'll still have the chance to make a present of it to an artiste
- l've got none - And I've only one
It is Adele! I know that squeal!
Here I am
Fantastic! You wrote that Gabriel should not recognise me. ls he really here?
See for yourself
That's Adele, and in my dress too!
I'll write a prescription for your poor sick aunt! But not here, please
Don't worry. The powder keg will explode tomorrow but then with a huge bang!
That watch, dear Marquis, is a real talisman
Yes, I have to thank it for countless conquests lf your wife knew that!
She's lying in her little bed now and dreaming of her little Chappi
She has no idea how late it is
Five to twelve, my love!
- Where do you live actually?
- Nearby, five minutes on the left
What? Just like me, only to the right. Odd we've not met yet
- That will change! - Yes! Friends!
Yes, friends, Franzl!
What are you laughing at now?
It's absurd if men embrace in the presence of beautiful women
Where are the beautiful women then? Wow!
That's her? The Hungarian countess?
That one will fall for me like mad!
Gentlemen, leave her to me!
Veni, vidi, vici and, boompsi! There is she!
I don't believe the "countess" fairytale
She'll bite the bait of the watch like all the others
- What a lovely lady's watch!
- lsn't it charming?
Where can one buy such a lovely little lady's watch?
At the little lady's watchmaker
- A talisman?
- A Sesame Opener!
- You're not married then? - Do I look it?
- Cheeky boy!
- Pardon? - Won't you lift your mask a bit?
- Not today, but tomorrow I can't make it tomorrow I have a sitting, a secret sitting closed to the public
- You're joking lf l could only filch that watch! As corpus delicti This charming manner, this figure, slim and dainty
And this pretty little foot which should be covered with kisses...
- ...if she'd allow it - instead of being in prison he's enjoying himself with kisses instead of penance
You won't elude your punishment! How easily this entrancing vision could vanish into thin air!
Won't you please lift the mask which conceals your face from me?
Sir, I beg you, don't be forward, hands off!
Etiquette bids you show respect for a masked incognito!
- How eagerly he ogles me
- Both confused and moved...
- How pleading his looks - ...she's retreating - He has no idea... - Let's see if it will work...
- ...who I am - ...or if she will resist - Yes, soon I will bring it off - Yes, soon I will bring it off
- l'll drag the villain to justice - l want to see if she'll resist...
- l'll try to lure him into the trap! - ...or be lured into the trap!
Oh, everything is getting blurred and I'm having palpitations, too!
To be sure, already love has set her heart astir!
It's an old complaint, but it's always over quickly
All's well if my heartbeats match the ticking of a watch
That we can find out at once! Let's count, please!
Yes, let's count, do let's count!
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, nine
No, that can't be, for after seven comes eight
You've utterly confused me.
Let's change places
Change places? How? You count my heartbeats now and I the ticking of your watch
Just for five minutes, please!
Now you count, my dear Marquis!
Here we go, then!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Hop, hop, hop, hop, and so we gallop!
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Hop, hop, gallop on to six hundred and nine!
- We can't have gone that far! - l've gone even farther!
- No, no, no! - Half a million! I mean it, half a million!
- How can one count so badly?
- To hell with mathematics!
No more repeating for you today!
- l only meant to... Surely you're joking!
She did not walk into the trap, but got my watch instead!
Oh, my watch, please! I only meant to...
She did not walk into the trap
Oh, if only I had my watch back! Oh dear!
I'm not sure. lf she were beautiful she wouldn't wear a mask
We'll ask her to take her mask off
Stop, ladies and gentlemen, that is against the agreement ln my house every lady has the right to hide or to reveal what she likes.
So don't be shy, fair one - My watch is gone
- Where is it then? In her decolletê - You'll never find it there
- You're right!
I believe the lady's not Hungarian at all
What?
Me?
Not Hungarian? Watch out, she bites!
And what guarantee have we that you are genuinely Hungarian?
The music! The sounds of my homeland!
Hey, csárdás!
Songs of my homeland, you waken my longing bringing tears to my eyes!
When I hear you, songs of my native land I feel drawn back to you, my fair land, to Hungary!
O you wonderful country of mine how brightly the sun shines there!
How green your forests, how smiling your fields o land where l knew such happiness!
Yes, your beloved vision fills my soul completely
And even though I am far from you to you alone my heart belongs for all eternity to you and to no other!
Fire, lust for life, swells the Magyar's heart! Swiftly to the dance! Gaily sounds the csárdás!
Sunburned maiden, my partner you must be Give me your arm, dark-eyed beauty!
Thirsty revellers, take your glasses and pass them quickly round!
Sip the fires that burn in tokay!
Drink a toast to the Fatherland!
The most beautiful csárdás I ever heard ln Kirghiz they say: "When violins play, the stomach must sing"
So now, ladies and gentlemen, to supper at last
What about the joke you promised? The Doctor promised me that today I would finally laugh again
- What about, Your Highness?
- About you, for instance Why me?
Because of some old story involving a bat
Stop, ladies and gentlemen, only I can tell this story
And then you'll laugh, not at me but at Doctor Falke lt was some years ago.
Falke and I were good friends, and unmarried What!
You're married?
Oh, my " hops" !
One never knows what will happen lt was at the Schönbrunn masked ball I was dressed as a butterfly.
And Falke... lf you tell the story like this, we'll never hear it
Falke was a bat ln the morning he was a bit tipsy i threw him out of the carriage in this costume with huge wings among the screaming market women and street urchins
And he had to flap his way home in shame
Since then he's been called Doctor Bat
And he has not yet had his revenge? - Precisely, Your Highness!
- He who laughs last, laughs best And now, ladies and gentlemen...
Champagne! The King of all wines!
Here's to His sparkling Majesty and all his subjects!
In the grape's fiery stream a heavenly substance is sparkling
Kings and emperors are fond of laurel wreaths But they're equally fond of the grape's sweet juice
Raise your glasses, and together drink a toast to the king of all wines!
Raise your glasses!
His Majesty's rule is known throughout the land
He is acclaimed as King Champagne the First!
His Majesty's rule is known throughout the land
He is acclaimed as King Champagne the First!
Long live Champagne the First!
The nations pay homage to the world's remotest corners
Champagne can wash away many cares
A wise ruler never lets his people go thirsty
Raise your glasses, and together drink a toast to the king of all wines!
Raise your glasses! His Majesty's rule is known throughout the land
He is acclaimed as King Champagne the First!
The monk, in the quiet of his cell, draws refreshment from the source
To moisten his lips he must take many a sip until his nose resembles a sparkling ruby
Raise your glasses and together drink a toast to the king of all wines!
Raise your glasses!
His Majesty's rule is known throughout the land
He is acclaimed as King Champagne the First!
Your very good health, Marquis!
Merci, merci, merci!
Long life, Chevalier and Marquis!
Merci, merci, merci!
Stop, listen to me!
I've had an idea! Listen to him!
I see that each has found his partner and many a pair of hearts is united in love
So let us all be one great band of brothers and sisters alike!
One great band, so be it! One great band, so be it!
You too, fair mask, belong to it!
If all are kissing, I can't refuse!
Do as I do, let each take his glass and to his neighbour sing these lines:
Brother dear and sister sweet we all want to be, repeat after me!
Brother dear and sister sweet let us use the tender "thou" for all eternity the same as now if tomorrow we still remember!
First a kiss Then a "thou"
Thou, thou, thou, all the way!
Brother dear and sister sweet we all want to be, repeat after him!
Brother dear and sister sweet let us use the tender "thou" for all eternity the same as now if tomorrow we still remember!
Let us have a waltz!
To sparkling music as merry companions let's crown our feast!
Take your place for a dance that will enhance the feast!
Love and wine fill us with bliss!
If through life we could waltz like this every hour would be sheer delight!
You're my support, dear friend!
Yes, your support for life!
What a touching reunion there's going to be in jail!
What a party, what a night of joy!
Love and wine fill us with bliss!
If through life we could waltz like this every hour would be sheer delight!
Brother, my watch is quite wrong What's the time by yours?
Brother, mine's not going right either because it's altogether gone!
Fair one, here before us all, please unmask at last so that I may see who is my prize and who got away with my watch
Don't ask to see what's hidden here its sight would make you tremble!
What's that supposed to mean? A good joke this!
Indeed, a capital joke!
If you're a man, take a look at her!
What a come-down if you gave in now!
Oh, I have the pluck all right! Now, my dear, resist me no longer!
I've a pimple on my nose
That's why my face is covered! I don't believe in that pimple!
No, he's not frightened by a pimple!
I've just got to see that face!
He's just got to see that face!
One, two, three Four, five, six! My hat, quick, my hat!
It's high time we left! His hat, quick! Listen to him shout!
- l'm due in jail!
- l should have gone hours ago! My hat, quick, my coat!
His hat, his coat, ha ha ha!
Give him his hat, his coat!
You'll come with me part of the way?
At the nearest corner we'll say goodbye! Let's go, then!
Au revoir! Ha ha!
What a party, what a night of joy!
Love and wine fill us with bliss!
If through life we could waltz like this every hour would be sheer delight!
Quiet!
When a decent civil servant comes to the office early he wants his rest.
He needs it
Quiet, you in No. 1 2!
You're not in an opera house, you're in a respectable place
Here you don't sing. Here you do time
First a dove, then a swan.
He must deal in birds So, now we'll get to work
Good morning!
That was the slivovitz
Good that I thought of it
- Sing with me...
- No, I won't sing. I'm angry
- Drink dear, drink quickly!
- Ah, that's different! Quiet!
I don't drink quickly.
I'm not stupid
Slowly. Slowly but regularly
Now that's a sound, a sound that fills up my soul
And now I have to get the slivovitz in as well lt has to come along this empty little street
A slivovitz like this makes another man of me But why shouldn't the other man have a slivovitz too?
I'm not stingy. I want everyone to have something
Here you are, drink up! Cheers!
Yes, that's a work climate!
" La donna ê mobile" . And he sings that in German?
He'd better not try that in Milan!
"This portrait is enchanting" He's a real flatterer.
And I haven't even given him my photo lf you sing again here, mister, then out you go!
That's what he was scared of, the cast-off choirboy!
But I'll bet myself a slivovitz he starts singing again by the... by the...
Not like that!
Now I'm embarrassed Not so high.
It makes it more difficult ...by the time I count to three
One, two another two half-past two...
Quarter to three
Ah, he didn't fail me after all!
I've won!
The slivovitz is gone. Now we'll start work
Mr. Prisoner, can't you open up for me from inside I've brought the wrong keys
No, sit tight.
It's open - like a modern prison
Mongols say: " lf you hadn't climbed, you wouldn't have fallen"
Come, Olga and Ida. Another waltz!
That's too fast!
Marquis, give me your hand.
Be my friend!
His Majesty's rule is known throughout the land He is acclaimed as King Champagne the First!
Long live Champagne the First!
- Leave me alone, drunken idiot! - You call a public servant a drunken idiot?
Take it back at once
- l wouldn't think of it
- Well, at least the "drunken"
- All right, you idiot
- Yes, that's better
Why not say that right away?
Look there!
A new admission, a fresher!
No, it's only our Governor in person He's groaning under the power of the press
That was my favourite finger
Governor, your little Frosch is here to report
Ah, don't tickle me!
Olga, I'd rather have a kiss!
Now he's started!
Governor, your civil authority stops here!
Anyway, I'm engaged.
Public servant Frosch reporting
Why did you waken me up, you drunken idiot?
I've heard that already today
- What's wrong with you?
- l have a headache
- No wonder, with a head like that
- So, what is it?
Your obedient servant reporting
Wow! I'm in the papers
Frosch, what is new?
- What?
Nothing comma Governor...
Only the prisoner in No. 1 2 wants a renal deviser
- A regal ariser
- What?
- No, a legal adviser
- He wants to speak to a lawyer
- He has a right to that
- Damned Champagne! - Blasted slivovitz!
- Yes
- Someone's ringing!
- That's because we have a bell
But I've become used to it
- Go and see who's there
- Do I have to?
- Maybe you think I should look?
- lt'd suit me better
Now go and look out of the window and see who's ringing!
It's your responsibility then. I think I've had a drop too much
- Nothing, Governor l've only bent a state windowpane a little doing my duty
- And what do you see, Mr. Frosch?
- Bits of glass, Mr. Governor
- And what else do you see?
- Two ladies. lt could be just one
- See how they look!
- Don't they like my hunting coat? Frosch!
What do the ladies look like below?
The ladies?
Below?
Governor, you're a naughty little lad!
Reporting the ladies below to be healthy Yes, a bit of all right
Now ask who they are and what they want. lt's enough to drive one mad
Who are you?
What do you want? It's enough to drive one mad! Just say we're Olga and Ida
They say they're Olga and Ida
Olga? Ida?
Show them up, quick, quick!
Quick drowned last night in the slivovitz
That Olga and that Ida! The two have never been 'ere Far too early they were seen 'ere.
But I take it all lying down 'ere
And with Olga and with Ida, I think nothing could be sweeter
If I only had something wet!
Tastes of nothing at all!
Governor!
Out there...
Now, of all times! And it's just been newly tiled outside!
Out there are two ladies who want to speak to a gentleman
But that's not you, with your... I kiss your hand, ladies!
Frosch, leave us alone
Wouldn't it be better to leave me with the ladies seeing the state you're in?
He's a dog in the manger!
I don't care! I'm at your service, ladies
You must be surprised, Chevalier, at our early visit - We have to make a confession
- Already?
You tell him!
- l'm not what I seem to be
- My sister isn't an artiste No.
Actually I'm in the service of Mr. von Eisenstein - As... as...
- His housekeeper, right? - Chamberlady
- She's just a housemaid
Housemaid!
And you let me kiss your hand? My mouth too!
- Discretion, please!
- Yes, that stays between us
But as you'll see Mr. von Eisenstein, I have a request I was in my mistress's best dress at the Villa Orlofsky and I want you to put in a good word for me
So that he forgives you?
No, so he'll give me the dress.
It suits me so well! - Absurd!
He'll fire you
- He did that long ago!
We've come to ask you to help my sister train as an artiste sort of "disinterestedly" , one could say I should let her train "disinterestedly" ?
- Have you lost your senses?
- Yes, I want to go on the stage
What? The theatre?
Do you have talent?
Do I have talent? Watch this, and see for yourself
When I act the innocent country girl, needless to say in a short skirt I teasingly frisk about as if I were a little squirrel
If a comely young man comes along, I wink at him with a smile only through my fingers like a child of nature and tug at my apron-strings
That's the way I rope them in if he follows me, naively I say:
Then by him on the grass I'll sit and finally you can hear me sing
When you have seen this you will have to admit the loss involved would not be trifling if, with such talent as this I did not go on the stage!
When I act as a noble queen with true majesty I move nodding here and nodding there with regal splendour surrounded
All the people make way for me listening reverently to my song
Smilingly my realm and my subjects I rule every inch their undoubted queen!
When you have seen this you will have to admit the loss involved would not be trifling if, with such talent as this I did not go on the stage!
See me play a lady of Paris who's married to a marquis
Then a young Count comes along who's after my wifely virtue
For two acts I refuse to yield, but in the third I begin to weaken
When suddenly the door flies open:
it's my husband, what am I to do?
Impressive!
" Forgiveness!" l cry and he forgives
The final scene moves all to tears
Naturally I'll let you train
Governor, there's another one here
He looks like a drunk head-waiter, probably a new admission
A Marker Renoir
- The Marquis!
- He mustn't see us here
Can you hide us? The whole prison is sold out
- Except No. 1 3
- Why is No. 1 3 free?
Normally my brother-in-law is in No. 1 3. But he's improved himself He's gone into politics
- Off you go!
- lf you give me a Mark
Are both ladies to be locked up?
Do what you like with them, but disappear! With both of them?
That'll keep me busy!
- Chappi!
- Franzl, what are you doing here?
I see you've something to drink.
Permit me. I'm dying of thirst
Help yourself, as if you were at home
Many thanks. I really am at home here now
No, I could say that sooner of myself
What have you been doing to be locked up here?
Dear friend, I must make a confession I'm not Chevalier Chagrin
My name is Frank and I'm the prison governor here
- That's a splendid joke!
- Yes, and I'm all wet
Are you still so drunk that you think you're the governor here?
- You doubt it?
- Yes, I doubt it
Soon you'll be convinced
You'll believe me directly. Just watch, my friend!
Ye gods!
This staff!
- How often do I have to ring?
- How often did you ring?
- Three times
- That's quite sufficient
Seize this gentleman and lock him up
As you order, Governor.
Up you get!
No resistance, please, against the power of the state
Leave me in peace!
You stink of schnapps
Should I rinse with "4 7 1 9" just for you?
Shall I put the bracelets on him?
No, no, let him go. It was only a joke
These eternal amnesties will ruin a state!
You'll excuse the little joke
What's going on?
- Governor!
- Yes? We've been walled in!
Idiot, there's the way out!
I thought it was the way in.
These eternal diversions!
Are you finally convinced, dear Marquis?
Don't bother me with your " Marquis"
I'm no more a marquis than you are a chevalier I've come to sit out my eight-day sentence and my name is Eisenstein
- That's a splendid joke!
- And now I'm all wet too
No, my friend, just as I've proved that I'm Prison Governor Frank I can also prove that you are not Mr. von Eisenstein
I find that interesting. So tell me!
Last night I arrested Mr. von Eisenstein personally
- Was he at home?
- Yes, naturally
He sat cosily at supper, in his dressing-gown, with his wife ln his dressing-gown, having supper with his...
- With my wife?
- No, with his wife
His wife is my wife!
What? I didn't know you both had a wife together!
Where is this Mr. von Eisenstein?
Governor, there's another one out there
- What kind of one?
- A lady, she says
- And what does she look like?
- That she didn't say
- What's her name?
- What did she say? Yellow Oak
No, wait.
Blue Beech
Now I've got it!
Rose Linden I knew it was a tree.
She could be a real marquise She had this chaise-longue behind her, like this
Excuse us a minute
I'm here and also at home, having supper, with my wife...
One, two... and now a little hop!
- Wh-wh-why are you guiding me?
- You're blind, aren't you?
N-n-nonsense! I'm not b-b-blind. That's my n-n-name!
- Your name is F-F-Frosch
- Yes
You're a big f-f-frog!
Get out!
For a stutterer, you've a fluid pronunciation!
I'll go and fetch Mr. von Eisenstein
Ha ha! Wh-wh-what did that i-i-idiot say? You're already h-h-here!
I'm not only h-h-here, I'm also th-th-there!
- What are you doing here?
- You s-s-sent for me I sent for you?
That i-i-idiot of a guard told me that Mr. von Ei...
Ei... Ei... "An egg a day keeps trouble away" from the " Uzbek Home Friend"
Eisenstein wanted to speak to me
Then Eisenstein is a fool
- That's right, yes
- Take that back immediately I'm so happy that I've got it out!
Stop! - l have an idea
- You a-a-amaze me!
- You must resign your job to me
- You mean for your n-n-nice job?
Enough! I'll use your hat, the briefcase, your coat...
Not the tr-tr-trous...!
...your glasses and your wig
Ha ha! Ha ha ha... haven't got a wig!
This is your own hair?
Eh? Whata... whata... whata...
- Water is outside
Come, you stuffed dove, here's the lawyer who wants to talk to you
But there's nobody here
Now he's so blind you can't see him at all!
- Where can he be?
- l don't know Ah, maybe he's...
- Will it take long?
- He stutters
Do you have a light?
Smoking is strictly forbidden here lt is forbidden for a civil servant to take such small bribes
But what happens behind my back is nobody's business
Oh, nice! What do you do then for a living?
- Opera singer
- Where do you sing?
Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, La Scala Milan, Castrop-Rauxel...
- ... St. Pölten
- St. Pölten?
I know it too
- Where do you pay tax?
- Here Here you are. You're a poor devil
Now he's gone too. lt's horrible.
My adventure is becoming a bore
Nobody cares
My Rosalinde is visiting me in prison!
Alfred, be sensible for once!
My husband can come any minute
He mustn't see you here, least of all in his dressing-gown!
Maybe the lawyer who's come knows what to do
One, two... Watch out! Now a little hop
You've grown a bit since the last time
- Get out! - Pronunciation's just as fluid!
I'm filled with trepidation
Were I to use violence... What will he ask me?
...he wouldn't tell me a thing
Can I take the risk... I'd love to knock him down ...of telling him the whole story?
But must desist ln this situation one must be discreet!
I must not so much as threaten this impertinent fellow here!
Now, will you please tell me everything in fullest detail without suppressing anything while I make notes!
It's a very queer case, as you will see in a moment
And even a rather involved one, as one must admit!
Well, then, state the facts of the case in which I am to act as your counsel!
A strange adventure befell me last night I was arrested by mistake and brought here because I was dining late with this lady lt serves you right!
You acted like a cad!
What has come over you?
You're supposed to defend me!
Forgive me if I use strong language I'm carried away by the subject I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, I'm supposed to be defending you!
This outburst, sir, is truly odd!
I'm confused by what I learn, but I'll keep calm
Do keep calm, for fits like that are really most unseemly!
I still have to conceal my rage
It all happened by accident and nothing wrong came to pass
But if it became known I would be compromised as my husband would no doubt believe me to have done wrong!
And rightly so, at that, you acted most disgracefully! What has come over you?
You're supposed to defend me!
Forgive me if I use strong language, but I'm carried away by the subject I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, I'm supposed to be defending you!
This outburst, sir, is truly odd!
I'm confused by what I learn!
So I'll keep calm, for l still have to conceal my rage
Do keep calm, for fits like that are really most unseemly!
Please tell me everything and omit nothing
Have you overlooked anything? Did nothing else happen?
Why these questions?
- Really, sir!
- Will you please say if anything else happened?
What do you take me for, sir?
Why these questions?
Answer me in all truthfulness, did nothing else happen? I must know everything!
Really, sir!
It almost looks as though you felt some sympathy for my husband
So let me tell you this:
my husband is a monster And never will I be able to forgive his wretched, faithless conduct
He spent all last night in the company of young ladies having the time of his life! But the wicked man won't get away with it
Once I have him back at home I'll first scratch out his eyes, then sue him for divorce!
She'll first scratch out his eyes, then sue him for divorce!
She'll first scratch out my eyes, then sue me for divorce!
As you now know everything, kindly tell us what to do
Tell us how we can put this husband's nose a little out of joint!
- This is too perfidious for words!
- What do you mean?
Why all this shouting, sir? Tremble, you malefactors, your punishment is nigh!
I stand here as avenger!
I myself am Eisenstein!
So he is Eisenstein!
Yes! Yes!
Yes, I'm the one you deceived, the one you lied to!
Now I will have vengeance awful to behold!
Did he not himself deceive me telling me most shameful lies?
And now he screams for vengeance!
No forgiveness, no regrets!
I alone claim vengeance!
So, you want revenge, you little ladies' watchmaker?
My watch?
You were the one I adored?
- Idiot that I am!
- So you're Mr. von Eisenstein?
Yes, I'm Mr. von Eisenstein, and you'll give me satisfaction
Take your hands out of my dressing-gown pockets!
First have the goodness to serve the other seven days yourself I should go to prison?
That would suit you! I won't think of it!
It seems you've reached the recognition scene Right. Mr. von Eisenstein is burning for you to lock him up
I am not Eisenstein at all!
Who'll prove that I am?
Governor, a prison revolt!
The ladies in No. 1 3 won't let me bath them
Oh! My former mistress!
- l'll give you a few in a minute!
- And Mr. von Eisenstein!
The evidence doesn't concern me?
I'm not going to prison Then I'll call on some other witnesses
O Bat, your triumph is complete.
Now let your victim finally go!
The poor man's sorry plight could hardly be more pitiful!
Won't you now explain to me what it's all supposed to mean?
I'm still groping in the dark
That's the Bat's revenge! O Bat, your triumph is complete.
Now let your victim finally go!
The poor man's sorry plight could hardly be more pitiful!
But now, please, do explain!
All that has troubled you was a joke that I devised!
And all of us had a part in it!
- What? The Prince?
- l had a part in it!
- And Adele?
- So did I! - Your supper?
- Was make-believe!
- But my dressing-gown?
- Just a prop! What relief, what joy, what bliss!
Oh, how glad I am to hear it!
Come, dear wife, into my arms!
Well, it was not quite like that
We won't rob him of the illusion that's giving him such joy!
And what's to become of me? If you stay in jail with me I will, as your paternal friend, have you trained for the stage
No, as patron of the arts I can't let such talent escape me!
It's just a habit of mine.
Chacun à son goût!
It's just a habit of his.
Chacun à son goût!
Rosalinde!
Forgive your faithful Gabriel!
You see, it was all the fault of the champagne!
It's all the fault of champagne, what we have endured this night
Yet it made me see my husband's infidelity and led him to repent!
Raise your glasses, and together drink a toast to the king of all wines!
Raise your glasses!
His Majesty's rule is known throughout the land
He is acclaimed as King Champagne the First!
Hello, information?
I'd like some information,please.
How can you know whether or not you're dreaming?
Pinch him, pinch him...
Show him that life is just a game.
Are you ever certain... that it ends with the night?
How can you know... when it's really over?
When I don't know what game I'm playing pinch my cheek, pinch my arm, pinch my ear
So I'll wake up and see that everything's the same... whether we're asleep or awake.
Pinch me, pinch me, pinch me
Show me.. let's show him that I'm not dreaming... ...that he fell asleep...
Pinch, pinch...or don't pinch.
The only time we don't dream... is when we're dreaming.
Should we steal Clipman's doodads?
Hurry up.
Careful.
Where were you, Gaudinier?
Martin, hurry up.
You think that's funny?
- You too cool for us?
It's the third time.
- But it's the first in red.
Titanic on the portside!
Gaudinier to the principal's office.
No!
It wasn't him!
So who was it?
No fair! You always blame him!
Especially 'cause when he gets in trouble, his mother cries. I swear.
You have to understand: he's all she's got. And we all know how nice you are, sir.
Gaudinier, I'm too nice.
Give me a clean floor and I'll give you a clean slate.
Get to it!
What's wrong with you today?
- Nothing.
You sure?
Just Gaudinier.
Everyone else, get to work!
I won't punish you if you work seriously and quietly.. for once!
Martin are you feeling better this morning?
Police! Hands up!
So how are you feeling today?
Great. I'm all laughs.
Happy now?
He seems better today.
- You're smart for a girl.
No one cares about the common good.
Everyone looks after his own interests.
Gaudinier, what do you think of that?
Gaudinier, I'm talking to you. -Uh...
I don't know, sir.
OK. I'll make it easier.
The division of Verdun, how about that?
I didn't say that I don't understand. I said that I don't know.
Don't be rude!
Me, rude?
If you prefer, I could say that I know very well.
That you know what?
-That I don't know.
But that wouldn't give you the answer.
OK, Gaudinier.
Go to the principal's office with a pink slip.
I've heard that one before.
-Wait, sir, Martin's sick.
It's not his fault. He has a fever. It comes and goes.
Cut the crap.
-I'm trying to help.
I'm sick of your bullshit.
Do the two of you mind?
Martin!
Bertier?
-It's his third pink slip.
Back to your seat. One of you is enough.
Martin!
He didn't go to the principal's office.
Where the hell is he?
-I looked in the infirmary.
He's not in the library either.
-Mind your own business!
But I want to help.
-We don't need you help.
Martin's not in the attic.
He knew that a third pink slip meant suspension.
Now he must be afraid of his mom.
She never yells at him.
-Yeah, but...
I'm in a rush 'cause if I'm 10 minutes late, Steps sends out an APB.
You give in too easily. If you don't spoil them with good behavior...
I told you. No one's home.
His mother's always at work.
Should we ring the bell?
Leave a message?
-Saying what?
Go easy on him. It's not his fault if he's a fool.
What if he ran away?
That way we wouldn't have any explaining to do.
His house sure is nothing to write home about.
Jerome, come look!
Is that his mother in the bed?
-I think so. She looks sick.
We have to call a doctor.
What about your father?
No way.
Anyway, Martin must have already taken care of it.
What are you doing there?
Police!
We were looking for you.
You could have rang the bell.
I'm sick of your crap. Get lost!
What the hell?
-Get lost!
What's wrong with your mother?
Maybe Antoine's father can help. He's a doctor.
Come in.
I think she's dead.
Are you serious? Because that's no laughing matter.
First we have to check. You got a mirror?
She's dead, all right. Time of death?
It happened so suddenly
It's coronary thrombroken.
What's that?
A piece of the heart breaks off and clogs the blood.
It's very serious. Let's call the doctor.
For a dead person?
Let's go.
It happened two days ago.
She looked tired when she got back from work.
I thought she was sleeping.
When I brought her dinner in bed... she wasn't moving.
I didn't know what to do. I had no one to talk to.
And us? What are friends for?
-You'll keep it a secret?
Did you call the police?
No, the hospital. That's the usual procedure.
First an autopsy...
-There's no need for that.
And what about the interment certificate?
What's that?
-Something very important.
What about me?
Do I go to the poorhouse?
No, the DCS.
-What?
They're in charge of abandoned kids. They run the orphanages.
I saw a lot of disgusting TV shows about them.
I'll pass on that.
I'll say!
Stop!
It's too late for the cops.
They'll yell at you 'cause you didn't call them sooner.
We can say that she just died.
They can determine the exact second of the murder.
This isn't a murder!
I have to call Steps.
Anyway, you can't leave her like that.
What would you do?
-Bury her.
Hi. It's me.
I'm working at Martin's and I'm staying for dinner.
No, I can't put his mom on. She's outside.
Yeah, bye.
Stepmothers...what a pain in the ass!
At least mine is.
Shit, she could trust me a little.
We'd have to come at night, but I don't know if it's a very good idea.
I think we should get out of here.
And I don't know what we'll find when we dig.
All those dead people.
The diggers must know how to go around the coffins.
You think dead people are stacked on top of each other?
Of course. How else could it be?
And we'll have to do something at the church too.
Thank God it's empty sometimes.
She didn't believe in God.
That's no reason. There are lots of people who...
Listen, if God exists, he'll understand that it's not easy for us. And if he doesn't exist, it's no big deal.
These gardens are nice and big.
Everyone in the building has one except my dad 'cause he thinks they're stupid.
Imagine the face of the man who digs up your mother while he's planting his tomatoes.
Cities suck. Everything's too close together.
It's nice here, really nice. And it's not far so we can always come see her. She'll like that.
How can you know what a dead person will like?
It's great here. Too bad Antoine couldn't stay.
Maybe you should sleep at my house tonight.
We could figure out a way.
-No, I can't leave her alone.
Marianne can I ask you something? -Let me go.
Are you an orphan?
-It's none of your damned business.
I just want to know. Did they put you in an orphanage?
I just want to know how you found your new parents.
In a box of Crackerjacks.
Just tell me. All I want is some information.
It's great to be an orphan. You can always get new parents.
OK?
Look.
-Wow!
If my father knew I took all this stuff...
I already got bawled out last night.
How are you today?
OK.
Look. Bodies rot underground.
That's gross. So why do they bury them in the first place?
Because it's worse above ground.
We have to hurry up.
Yeah, that's why some people prefer to stay home in an urn.
I know. It's called incineration.
Should we burn her?
Are you crazy?
The whole town would see the smoke.
A coffin is better. It's more discreet.
Yeah, but how can we find one?
So you think you're on vacation?
Gaudinier I wrote to your mother about your three day suspension.
I asked her to come see me.
We have to put an end to this attitude problem.
Get going.
...a dry seed and a seed soaked in water to see it better under the microscope.
"NEED A WOODEN CRATE ABOUT SIX FEET LONG"
Take the dry seed and look at it closely.
It's hard because it contains very little water so it should resist the frost.
Now take the seed soaked in water.
You can see a thick skin.
Later, we'll remove it with the scalpel.
Under this skin you can see the two cotyledons.
"WE PAY CASH"
After you separate them, you'll find an embryo. This is what we'll look at under the microscope.
So take the plant, the seed, your scalpels and start to take off the outer skin, the first layer, and...
May I please go to the bathroom?
-Yes, you may.
So, take your scalpel...
Be careful. Her mother's a social worker.
So what?
Not everyone spills the beans to mommy and daddy.
How much?
-It depends on your crate.
It's a grandfather clock. It doesn't work anymore.
Can we see it?
It's important.
You want to skip lunch?
How tall is it?
About six feet.
As long as it's bigger than 5'4".
There's even a porthole.
Yeah, but the view won't be terrific.
It's fine with me.
How much do we owe you?
-That depends on why you need it.
Should we tell her?
Yeah, I think we can.
-Me too.
Can you keep a secret?
Do you swear?
On my mother's life.
Now I'm scared.
-Don't worry.
Anyway, for what it's worth, the clock's on me.
That's nice of you.
Shit, hurry up.
I've been hanging around for an hour.
If I catch pneumonia, it'll be your fault.
Sorry but they wouldn't go to bed.
How did you manage?
When Dallas is on, Steps isn't tired.
At 9 when I said "Night, folks" you should have seen their faces.
Did you put the pillow under the sheets?
Come in.
-Is everything OK?
Don't be afraid. It's my brother, Oliver. He's with us.
He knows?
-I swore I'd say nothing.
We can't manage without him.
How old are you?
-16.
Lucky stiff. I'm Jerome. Why are you helping us?
I'm happy Claire's growing up.
Don't start. Are we going or not?
Remember that they're coming back at 12.
Your brother's great.
If I had one like that, Steps would shut her face.
What's it like having a social worker for a mother?
Is she cool?
I don't know.
Did you see her?
Who?
Martin's mother. Since she died.
-Of course.
What's it like?
-Nothing special.
You never saw a dead person?
-No.
It's heavy.
Do you believe in life after death?
No. After, there's nothing.
That's impossible. When it's over, there has to be something else.
What does "nothing" mean?
One thing's for sure, we'll never finish if we start off like this.
Where's Martin?
Is he sleeping?
-Should we wake him up?
No, no, let's go.
What should we do?
Hey, where are you going?
You were sleeping, so...
-No, I was just thinking.
We brought the clock, I mean the...
Good.
Can I go see?
-See what?
She never saw a dead person.
I don't know. It might be a shock for a girl.
I want to see her.
-No, wait, Claire.
What's she doing?
We should go in.
Let's take the clock in. It's a good excuse.
You should pick out a nice dress for her.
I was going to.
This one's not bad.
-No.
This one's better.
I can keep the other one for when I want to think of her.
It's funny, before I didn't tell her anything and now I always have things to say.
It'll be hard to put it on a... corpse.
It's not a corpse. It's my mother! Don't touch her.
Do you want us to help you or not?
-Yes...no.
I can't undress her in front of you.
Claire, can you help me?
I don't know if I'll be able to.
Of course you can. The two of us will manage.
I'll call you when it's time to put her in the clock.
I hope he won't take forever 'cause I have to get home.
Do you think we're making a mistake?
What else can we do?
I didn't tell him everything I heard about orphanages.
Like what?
Marianne wouldn't tell me a thing.
Just the other day, they showed one where they beat the kids.
One of them had to go to the hospital.
But that couldn't happen too often.
Yeah, well I can tell you that I never saw a nice one on TV.
In the United States there are great ones.
Yeah, right. How do you know?
-Everyone knows.
Mom.
What's got into you?
-Nothing.
Bye.
What are you doing?
Get lost.
A corpse is damned heavy. And it's cold.
Aren't you scared?
-Of what?
Did a dead person ever bawl you out or slap you?
It's just the living. Anyway, I...
-Give me a hand.
Why did you tell him?
We need muscles. -What if he screws up?
He's OK.
Too many of us are going to be missing from the cafeteria.
No one's forcing you.
What do you want from us?
-I have the right to take a walk.
What should we do?
Tell her? -No way.
Why not? Her of all people.
-She's the kind to blab all over.
Just to show off in front of the boys.
-What do you mean?
She goes out with eighth-graders. Lots of them.
Even my brother.
-Olivier?
Among others.
I think she'll understand.
I don't care about your baby secrets.
Go away!
Anyway, I'm not going to leave.
Does everyone agree?
No one says anything to anyone.
Swear it.
I swear.
-I swear.
I swear.
I swear.
I swear too.
This is all I did in two hours.
You're lucky to be suspended.
Haudry's class was the pits.
I can't dig anymore by myself.
That's why we're here.
Julien, take the shovel from him.
We're doing all we can so that he feels good, and you cry.
I know, but I can't help it.
-So leave.
Sorry, but it makes me cry.
-I noticed.
It's because I like you a lot. Do you need anything?
I'm an orphan too.
Well I'm not. I just don't know who my father is.
Marianne, come look.
Leave her alone. I don't care if she cries.
You don't care?
No, that's not what I meant.
Can't you control yourself?
-But it's really sad.
Lots of things are sad but you don't have to cry for all of them!
Maybe I do.
Can't you think about him a little?
-I am. That's why I'm crying.
If you can't cry for a dead person, what can you cry for?
Stop, stop!
Stop screaming at each other, please.
How's he going to...
I mean now that...
Keep a lid on it, Julien.
How am I going to do what?
I don't know...food and everything, if you're all alone.
We'll help him. We'll get by.
Wait. I was thinking that maybe some parents are better than others.
They could help us because they're more used to...
We keep our lips sealed.
OK? -OK.
It wouldn't work with my parents but there are some you can trust.
Are we going to dig?
-We'll never finish.
I'll get it done.
It'll take all day.
Maybe I could ask my brother to help us. And to get more shovels.
But if we cut classes again they'll notice. And that's exactly what we don't...
You're such a schmuck! Is there anything inside your head?
Look. Do you really need slide? Get close to the photo.
Look at the apses, the entrance to the cathedral.
We're going to look at each item on he list at the top of the photo.
It's beautiful. Each stone is a painting.
We could spend hours discussing all the aspects of cathedrals their construction, their importance to the country.
Let's begin with number 1...
M. Gibert is one of your teachers, isn't he?
I'm his neighbor... His house is on fire.
Excuse me.
Yes, yes.
You'll all go to study hall, quietly and calmly I have an emergency.
Is it serious, sir?
-I hope not.
No, it's not serious, it's not serious.
Teacher's pet! Nerd!
Quiet, quiet, keep quiet.
Leave the shovels here.
The hole is great.
There's lots of extra room. If Steps isn't busy...
That's not funny. When mom's inside we can't lift up the clock.
-If we work as a team...
We've closed it for the time being.
You'll see tonight, we lined the inside with tin foil.
It's really pretty. It'll be great with the candles.
Why tin foil?
Because it protects.
Antoine said that's how Steps keeps food fresh. And I always promised her that I'd give her jewelry for Mother's Day. And now I sort of kept my promise 'cause it's all silvery inside.
Let's go.
We'll never make it two miles to the woods.
What are we going to do?
I said it was too heavy.
Listen, this is a good start. Now we're all set for tonight.
We need a cart.
-I have a wheelbarrow.
Too small.
-Not if she's sideways.
I'm counting on you to be reasonable and to go to bed early.
My mother's very strict so...
-Very good. I understand.
Thank your mother for inviting Claire. I'll call her a little later.
No, I'm not a baby.
And my sister's always hogging the phone.
Oh, you have a sister?
-A half-sister, mom.
Oh, I understand. OK, get going.
Did you take your toothbrush?
Wait here. I'll go in the back door.
Hello ma'am. I've come to pick up Marianne.
Hello. I hope she's ready.
Are you eating at your house tonight?
-Yes, ma'am.
It seems tough, but if you try hard enough, you can get your parents to do anything.
Here, look what I've got. Peas, pot roast, candy.
It's all I could get. OK?
There was nothing at my house.
Go see her.
You look at her for a minute and think about her. Then you come eat.
If there's anything you want to know, just ask.
Eat!
she doesn't look dead.
I think so!
Do we have to stay much longer?
No, go eat.
Make some room.
I'm not too hungry. -Eat. It's the funerary feast.
What's that?
-It's to celebrate the dead.
You know how adults jump at the chance to party.
In any case, my mother's happy when I eat, so...
Wine?
-Are you nuts?
It's great stuff. Too bad I couldn't find any whisky.
It must be Pierrot.
I told Mozart to come for the music.
He knows?
Yes. I swore I'd say nothing. But I only know dance music.
It's the same thing only slower.
Martin, do you have pieces of black cloth?
In the movies, the ladies wear veils.
It's not worth it.
-But...
Stop meddling!
-Don't fight!
OK, it's time.
The three volunteers come with me.
This car is my father's but there's another.
There. It's Steps' but she hardly uses it anymore.
Does it still work?
Push.
I'll open the door.
Go ahead, push.
-It doesn't work.
Try taking off the hand-brake.
Now push.
Move. I'm starting it up.
You're sure you know how?
If we wake Steps, we'll be in deep shit.
I know cars like the back of my hand.
Move away, don't stay there.
Be careful.
-Just watch this.
I think we should just forget about it.
What if we pushed it to Martin"s?
The engine's so old, it would probably be faster
What were you all saying?
Shit, it works!
-Come on, get in.
Amazing!
Look what we've brought home.
You'll have to back it in.
Careful.
She's going to fall.
Not if we drive slowly.
We've just got to hold her.
Be careful.
How should we do it?
Moving men have ropes that they put underneath.
We don't have any rope.
-We'll manage.
Watch out.
Let go.
OK, I think we can start.
What do we do now?
Whatever you want.
What's it like usually?
I...we stood there and everyone came up to us and shook hands and everything. You should stand there.
This is stupid. -Any other suggestions?
I liked her a lot.
You didn't even know her!
I'm guessing.
I'm saying it for Martin's sake.
What do we do now?
Usually we just leave.
But we just started!
I knew she was wrong.
That's what I saw.
What about the flowers?
And don't we have to fill the hole?
Do we have to do it all tonight?
I don't care how it's supposed to be. It's my mother and I'll decide.
Let's start all over.
First there's a speech.
-He's right.
What speech?
Say why she was a great mother.
-I didn't prepare anything.
OK, listen, we can do the moment of silence. That way you'll have time to think.
We'll keep quiet for one minute.
Is it a minute yet?
-Shut up!
Go ahead. It's your turn.
I'm not too good at speaking.
Mom said it was her fault, 'cause she didn't have enough time to take care of me. Uh...my mother was a cleaning lady and it's not fair 'cause she preferred to stay home...
I had a father. I don't know his name or who he is.
Mom didn't want to tell me and now I'll never know.
It would have been better if she told me, maybe he could have...
Mom, now I'm going to do everything right maybe that'll make you come back.
I don't think so, but maybe...
What should we say now?
Whatever you want.
What she was like.
She was nice tall with brown hair. With a loud voice, but soft at the same time.
she smelled really good even though her hands were all rough from her job.
I don't want to cover her with earth, because...just maybe...
It's impossible.
Don't worry. We'll take care of everything.
We'll put the flowers...hey, Marianne, Pierrot, Claire.
But the flowers go after.
-No more advice!
That's how we fill the hole?
-No, let me, I should do it.
No.
-Let me.
I can't.
How's he going to get by?
-He's got us.
Yea, but there are things that adults...
We'll take real good care of you.
We forgot the music.
Hey, Martin's not here.
-I've looked everywhere.
Mozart, did you see Martin?
-No.
It's normal. He's suspended. He has one day to go.
He should be home. I said we shouldn't have left him alone.
Shit!
-Jerome!
I was at the hole. I mean the grave.
-Why?
I wanted to put some flowers.
Alone? -Wait!
Martin's there.
What's he doing?
-I don't know.
Hey, where are you going?
-I forgot my math book.
We forgot we had math today.
Did he spend the night here?
-He wanted to stat next to his mother. I think he was scared.
I would have been too.
I told you so. -But...
Just don't listen to him.
We're not going to make it.
-Yes we will.
We're too young! -So stay a Step-baby!
What are you doing here?
Are you OK? -Yeah.
How come you're not at school?
We're on our way.
You slept here?
You were scared at your house?
What an ass.
I was hanging around and I was tired so...
Get going. You're going to be late.
Can we leave you alone?
-It's great to be suspended three days. It should last all week long.
Get going!
You're not cold?
-No, I'm OK.
When my parents died, I was cold all the time.
Mom, I'm going to work at Marianne's.
All this stuff must have been expensive.
Shit, it's burnt.
It's not my fault.
Usually I just watch.
You see, I told you.
You have to cook meat with oil.
No, dipshit! It's potatoes that you cook with water.
Listen to this! Heat the butter and brown the lamb.
Put it in the pan with chunks of fat...
If Steps finds out that I stole her cookbook...
Don't worry, you'll eat soon.
OK.
I'll help them. What can I do?
No, no... -Get out of the kitchen.
OK, but I didn't do it on purpose.
Here's the cake.
How is it?
-Wait for the spaghetti!
How long does it take to cook?
Taste it anyway. I don't know if it's good.
It couldn't be too bad.
At least we can say that all this has taught us how to cook.
You'll see. In three days it'll be delicious!
And we're having fun.
I decided to quit school.
Are you crazy?
Give me a good reason besides making my mother happy.
You promised her! And if you quit now, they'll notice.
I don't care!
That's how you end up in an orphanage As soon as a kid is alone, they pop up.
They're short of kids, so whenever they can get their hands on one...
I have to bring back my pink slip signed And I can't forge my mother's signature.
Can I see it?
Do you have an example of it?
Forget it.
We'll never be able to.
-Let me try.
Not bad.
OK, Marianne, you'll do it every time.
Soon they won't see the difference.
You see, whenever there's a problem, we find a solution.
What's going on?
-Mind your own business.
Get lost! We're gonna get nabbed.
-The schoolyard's for everyone.
Get lost!
Get lost!
So?
He wants to see his mother.
Shit!
What did he answer?
What we rehearsed. She's busy, but he got a whipping.
The principal was thrilled.
What do you expect?
Sadism goes with the job.
He was a kid once too.
He has no memory. Amnesia goes with the job too.
All the same, it worked.
-Here's Martin.
So, what happened?
It was great. He believed it all, the letter, everything.
You see, we can outsmart them.
Give them a pill and they'll swallow it.
So, a punished student is a hero?
No, sir, that's not why.
Write me three pages entitled Why Killers Become Heroes.
I'll grade it myself.
Are you happy now?
Same for Gaudinier who doesn't seem too affected... ..by his mother's disciplinary measures.
No, not him, sir.
He didn't anything. -You too.
OK, any other volunteers?
Is there a Gaudinier in your class?
-Who?
Gaudinier?
-Martin?
Yes, why?
What's he like?
He's nice. Very nice. What did he do?
Oh, you like him a lot. I understand.
He's..he's just a friend.
I have to go see his mother.
Oh, no!
He always gets yelled at. And he lives alone with her...
Don't worry, honey. She hasn't answered the principal's letters so it's my duty to go talk to her.
When are you going?
-I'm on my way now.
I'll come along. I'll show you where it is. I have to ask him something.
Listen, I shouldn't let you...
My math book.
Wait for me
Stop playing.
Get out of here!
Go!
Marianne?
Get to Martin's fast.
My mother's on her way to see his mother
Think of something.
I'll try to stall her as long as I can.
Wait.
Are you doing this on purpose?
Here it is.
Martin Gaudinier?
Hello.
I'm Claire's mom.
She has something to ask you.
Me too, in fact. I work for the school and I'd like to meet your mother.
I'm sorry, ma'am but she's not home.
When might I be able to see her?
It's tough because she works a lot. Even I don't get to see her too often.
-Here, give her this letter and tell her to call me or the principal.
Sure, ma'am.
Is everything OK, Martin?
Do you need anything?
N, no. Thank you, ma'am.
Good-bye.
-Good-bye.
You didn't ask him about your math.
It wasn't worth it.
I don't like your job.
But why? It's my job to help people.
-You scare them. Just like the cops.
What on earth are you talking about?
-You wouldn't understand.
I don't see how I might have scared Martin.
He didn't seem too afraid.
Anyway, everyone is ganging up on him.
Maybe that's why the principal wants to see his mom.
It's not her fault if she's poor.
No father? -No.
So she needs to work a lot.
I understand. So I'll try to see her at her home.
No, it's worse. Try to understand. He'll think everyone's angry at him.
What should I do with this letter?
-Garbage can!
No, wait!
Stop!
Are you stupid or what? They'll think something's wrong then they'll come poking around.
What'll we do then?
That's what I was trying to say.
Martin, get some stationary.
Marianne, your pen.
If it's a letter they want...
Watch your spelling.
My mother made a ton of mistakes.
Yeah, but we have to be unbeatable. We'll check everything in the dic.
Write:
Dear Sir,
I am sorry I couldn't come to see you but my work keeps me very busy. Wait!
I would like, however, to come this Friday...
Are you crazy?
-Relax ...at 4 o'clock.
Next, we'll see how animals live at a slower pace and how they make the transition from a slow pace to a normal one.
Keep quiet.
A bomb threat, surely just a bad joke.
Children, in utter silence you will leave the class and follow your teacher.
Follow me. Don't take your things.
Bomb!
Don't scream Madame Haudry, keep your class in order.
Children, please. Keep moving.
Tell the principal that your mother came but that with the panic she wasn't able to see him. And with her job...
How did you pull this one off?
It's great.
Claire!
But...hurry up!
What's the risk? Come here.
In the movies, when it's dangerous, they kiss.
But you told me there was no danger?
Have you kissed girls before?
Yeah. I'm physically attracted to you but it's not you that I love.
Who is it?
-I can't tell you.
Does he know?
-Are you crazy?
Is it a friend?
-I'm not going to say.
Antoine?
-How do you know?
Anyway, he'll never want me.
You won't tell him.
-Cross my heart.
And it's Martin that I should... He's the one that needs affection.
He's got Marianne.
-She's a slut.
Does she go out often?
What are those two doing here?
So did you tell him?
Sir, did you see my mother?
-What for?
It's great!
It must be expensive.
-I'll say!
Now you can't get anymore bad grades or pink slips. Because I won't know what to do if they start looking for your mom again.
It's going to be tough.
Piece of cake.
I'll help you in English Claire in Math, Antoine in French, Dede in Science.
You'll be unbeatable.
If we work as a team we'll manage to get off their shitlist.
How do you patch a pair of pants?
My mother takes the two ends, puts them on top of the other then she sews them like that.
It's a shame the girls couldn't come.
They're right we have to be careful or else our parents will get suspicious.
And you know, girls don't know how to do anything anymore.
You saw when we were cooking. It's worse for sewing.
Do you think you should tell a girl when you love her?
I don't know. Who are you thinking of?
Marianne?
Claire?
I'd like to know if she likes me.
I don't think she even knows what it means.
She doesn't love anyone.
Look at the time. We should hurry up.
Shit, the neighbor. Hide!
Hello, Martin. Is your mother in?
I doubt it or else you wouldn't be blasting the music.
Sorry, sir. She's working.
Good for her. I mean she's lucky. Because as far as my job hunt is going..
Tell me, do you need anything?
No, no. Everything's fine.
OK I'll come back sometime when she's home.
It's the third time he's come.
-Does he suspect something?
Were your mom and him together?
Are you kidding?
Think about it. They don't tell us every time they do it.
Your mother hasn't given up men since you were born!
I think so.
Don't be naive! They have to do it just for the hygiene.
Stop!
Besides, he's married.
Big deal.
Take my mom for example...
I hope he's right. All we need now is a jealous lover.
OK, I'm off to Steps.
Sure you don't want to sleep at my place?
You can go in by the balcony.
No one will know.
I want to stay here.
Marianne.
Marianne, I know you're there.
How did you know?
Thanks for the flowers.
My parents grave is far away, so...
I never would have thought that we could become friends.
I wanted to but i was afraid to say so.
It sucks that we can never pick our friends.
The ones I have aren't the ones I...
I never say anything because I'm happy to have them.
I didn't know you were like that.
-What time is it?
We have to go.
Did you learn your history?
-No.
Come on.
Martin Gaudinier to the blackboard.
Look at his pants!
You see, you laugh at my bike clips. I could call you 'Patches'.
I didn't do it on purpose.
I'm sure.
No fair! In a public school you can't tease someone 'cause he's poor.
I'm not teasing.
It's not his fault if his mother can't buy him nice clothes.
Enough.
I didn't say anything disagreeable to your friend.
Let's get on with the drill.
You'll probably flunk him for this.
What's going on here?
We know you don't like Gaudinier.
I like Gaudinier very much and I've noticed that he's been trying harder.
Go back to your seat and we'll continue.
Bingo.
ADULTS... WHEN YOU BAWL THEM OUT, THEY'RE WORSE THAN...
Very well, let's leave Hughues Capet and the year 1000 and move on to Philippe Auguste.
Helene, you will read.
Bertier, give me that paper.
what paper, sir?
Martin!
Martin!
And because I have to do well in school, I started working hard.
What's funny is that everyone is doing better. And the teachers don't understand why.
We found other articles about orphanages and I swear that it's not for me.
If you had told me my father's name, I could have tried to find him.
I looked through your stuff, even though I know you don't like that.
I found a photo. I don't know if it's him with you.
But you were really pretty.
I hope there was nothing between you and Mr. Campola because he stops by almost every day.
Gaudinier, I have to ask you something.
Is your mother sick?
What's wrong, do I smell or something?
-Leave him alone.
I want to know if his mother's sick.
-It's none of your business.
My father wants to know. I couldn't care less.
But she hasn't come to work, so...
That's where his mother was a cleaning lady.
It's disgusting to hire the mother of someone you know as a maid.
She found a better job.
Why better?
You think it's fun cleaning houses?
I never thought...
Are you proud that your parents use a woman just 'cause she's poor?
Don't worry. It's not your fault if your parents are like that.
OK, but what am I going to tell my father?
What did he do?
-Butt out!
Should we tell him?
Nicolas, we'll tell you everything if you swear...
Do you believe in God?
I cross my heart not to say anything.
OK?
OK, we'll tell you everything.
Martin, I never see you alone.
It's normal. They all take care of me.
Come here.
Martin.
What's wrong?
You can kiss me if you want.
Here?
But you don't believe in God.
I thought you were already going out with someone.
But I'll stop if you want.
Really?
Did you forget to question Gaudinier again?
No. His mother doesn't want to come anymore.
I guess it was too difficult for her to let us know.
I heard that you're not the greatest people to work for,
It's Martin that said so!
He must be his mother's pride and joy: the class dunce!
This term, he's doing great.
-Don't talk back.
Is it like stealing if you don't declare your cleaning lady?
Now I've heard it all!
You'd be better off worrying about your grades.
When a kid's parents have an accident, who's in charge?
Of who?
You're a barrel of laughs tonight.
Of the kid.
If the parents die, for example.
Nicolas, do you want something bad to happen to us?
No, I'm just asking.
Is this for school?
Uh, yeah...we're doing a survey.
Well, he goes to his next of kin. His grandparents.
And if he doesn't have any?
With an uncle or cousins.
And if he has no family?
-I've had enough of this!
Don't lose your temper.
Then he goes to an orphanage.
Is that good?
-Well, it's better than nothing.
Hi.
-Hi.
I managed to make something edible. Are you hungry?
No, I can only stay half an hour.
For once you're all alone.
Everyone's busy. I was going to do my homework.
I don't even watch TV anymore.
I broke up with Xavier.
I didn't ask you to.
You're not jealous?
You're weird sometimes.
Hide!
Hello, Martin.
Is your mother in?
-No, sir.
I think she is.
I have to see her.
It's impossible.
It's very important for me.
You're married!
Tell her that I look for her every day.. ...that I don't know how she's avoided me... That I can't live without her.
You'll remember all this?
She doesn't want to see you anymore. -What did you say?
She said you should stop coming.
When?
I want her to tell me herself.
She told me to tell you to stop thinking she loves you and to leave her alone because she loves just her son.
But that's impossible.
I know that she loves you. I do too.
She even said that if you didn't listen, she'd go see your wife.
She couldn't have said that.
More than once. And she's not here!
Well done.
I don't think you'll see him again.
You know some men will say anything to get what they want.
I didn't know about them. If it's his fault that she got her throm broken...
Her what?
-Her throm.
What's that? She broke something?
-It's part of the heart.
If her heart was broken, there has to be a reason,huh?
People don't die from love. At least not in real life.
How could you know what my mother was like? You didn't even know her.
Calm down.
The proof is that she didn't even tell me about this guy.
She couldn't. You know, a woman...
Leave me alone, you too!
It must be worth a lot.
He won't go higher than 4000.
What a sleazeball!
We shouldn't give in.
Adults!
They make money by using us.
Why discuss? Let's mug him.
We should tell the police.
So they'll start wondering about Martin?
With Nicolas' money, we're at 2750.
But with electricity, phone, rent and lunch money, we need almost 5000.
They mail everything together. You don't have time to breathe.
If we accept, we still have 1750.
Maybe we could bring other stuff later,
So what are we going to do?
Accept?
Go without me. I'll wait here.
Is something wrong?
No, no. It's nothing.
I liked that chest.
Excuse me.
16 out of 20!
Very good, Claire.
Nicolas Bosserat, 14.
Jerome Callier, 15.
Very good, Jerome.
And they think it's thanks to them.
Antoine Bertier, 17.
Very good.
And finally, anything's possible.
Martin Gaudinier, 18.
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray for Martin!
Hey, Martin!
Gaudinier!
Move away, move away!
What happened? -I don't know.
We have to take him to the hospital.
Sir, it's Gaudinier.
You have to tell his parents.
-No, no!
Because his mother worries about every little thing.
And we're his friends, so we can tell her.
No, no. Move away...go on.
How do you feel, Martin?
I think it's his ankle.
-Move away don't stand there.
Martin, what happened?
It's nothing, nothing at all.
-Are you OK?
You stay here. -Chin up.
What does Clipman want now?
Madame. This afternoon your son had an accident.
Fortunately, it was not too serious.
His ankle is being put in a cast; he will come home tonight.
I am his history teacher, and I have wanted to meet you for quite some time. Please call me at 43...
The nerve of him!
I think that's nice.
-Nice?
We're trapped!
He's clueless!
-So what?
Don't fight.
-I agree.
I don't care.
It's a nurse. If she thinks he's alone, she's going to wait.
If she sees us, it's even worse.
-It depends on what we tell her.
Lean against me.
You see, no one's home. I'll wait for my mother. But don't stay.
She could come back late.
I intend to stay.
Do you have a phone?
You see? We have to do something.
Just go up to her.
Why me?
You look serious.
You had us scared for a while. Are you OK?
I'm his older brother.
You didn't tell me you had a brother.
He always forgets about me.
Mom said she'd be home soon and that I should watch him till then.
I intend to wait too.
Ma'am, she'll yell at us.
Why?
You think I can leave you alone?
Of course, with my brother.
Mom said that you could leave.
Are you sure I can leave you?
Of course.
Then I'll be going.
You're a very brave boy.
See you soon. Get some rest.
Good-bye.
That was hairy!
It's like Alfred Hitchcock. Something always pops up.
Does it hurt? Come sit down.
It's a sprain. Not a break.
But I have to mail the doctor my mother's insurance number. And I don't even know where it is. Or even what it looks like.
We'll look around. I can always ask my mother to lend me hers.
Or I can steal it. Don't worry, we're unbeatable.
We're in deep shit.
Clipman is asking everyone about Martin's mother.
Sir, what do you have against Martin now? He didn't do anything.
Relax. I'm just asking some questions about his mother.
What about her?
She's great.
You'll never know how great she is!
Yeah, I believe you.
When did you see her last?
Yesterday..uh, not too long ago... two days ago.
OK, but I started wondering maybe your friend needs us, maybe he's very unhappy. Maybe his mother left with a man and Martin's alone and afraid.
Not her, sir, she's not the type.
You haven't found Martin strange lately?
Anything but strange.
Careful, here he comes.
Forget about this and be nice to him. You never know.
Why do you go to his house every morning?
It's none of your business.
He's my friend.
I'll do whatever I want. Same for him.
He needs a buddy, not a body.
Excuse me.
Martin Gaudinier to the principal's office.
Stop!
Missed again, Titanic.
Does anyone have the courage to tell me why I'm called 'Titanic'?
Sink or swim!
If I'm sinking instead of singing, it's thanks to retards like you 23 years as captain of the Ship of fools.
So, either you sing seriously or I'll give you a test you'll never forget.
Who doesn't want to sing?
1, 2, 3...
No, no, stay in your seats.
I sent for Gaudinier.
Where is he?
He left for your office, sir.
Are you sure?
Your classmate is possibly having some problems which he would prefer to keep secret.
So try to be nice to him.
I just hope he doesn't disappear.
He's not at the grave.
-I told you so.
Where would I hide if I were Martin?
In the school attic?
No, I have the keys.
-What if we don't find him?
Is this his mother?
You don't even know?
At your house you don't even look at the maid?
Don't start again!
I didn't pick my parents!
OK, I have to go, 'cause Steps is back and better than ever.
Hey, Martin!
We've been looking for you for 2 hours.
Didn't you hear us?
I was afraid you weren't alone.
I forged another letter explaining that your mother is on a trip.
I could get a friend to mail it from Paris.
It won't work. In three days, everything will start over again.
We don't have much of a choice.
You hide or you run.
For how long?
-I don't know but they can't find you.
Where am I going to sleep?
I can't stay outside all the time.
I knew today would suck.
Last night I dreamt that my mother wasn't dead
That we buried her alive and she couldn't dig her way out.
I saw that on the late show.
-I'm sick of your damned movies!
I woke up and ran there.
I even dug a little. It's dumb.
But why didn't you tell me earlier?
Would he have gone to an orphanage?
Don't you know what happens to kids in them?
You're getting carried away. They can be very nice.
You swore you wouldn't say anything.
I know.
You can come in.
Are you going to take care of him, ma'am?
You're all going to go to the police with Martin.
I'll go with you if you want.
Are you going to tell on us?
No, but...
I understand your...but I can't, I can't.
I mustn't.
It's against my ethics.
But Claire told us...
Claire can be stupid.
No, I'm sorry, honey. But what you have done is very serious.
We're proud of what we've done!
But children can't just...
But what more does he need?
He's eating well...sleeping well.
He didn't do anything bad and he's doing well in school.
Better than before!
Us too, as a matter of fact.
-Tell us what else we should do.
I understand, I understand.
But I shouldn't understand.
You'll have to be the judge. A judge? But we didn't kill his mother.
No, a judge for children He'll decide.
No social worker went to see him?
Just a neighbor and his history teacher.
I understand.
They're all so busy and they don't realize how grave...
There's nothing grave about it!
I can't do a thing.
I'll keep quiet because I promised... But I must ask you not to tell a soul that I'm privy to all this.
It's risky for me to keep quiet.
But we trusted you.
Do you think I like being cornered?
You think that's why I chose this profession?
I would have liked...
I thought...
Injustice is horrible. But often you can't do anything about it.
We can, if they'd just leave us alone.
OK, go to your class.
I'll think all this over.
And this is a secret between me and you. Promise?
What's the secret?
Get lost!
Get out of here!
Children, calm down! Children!
Before class, you will all speak to these men... about one of your classmates.
Come this way, with me.
Let's hope that Martin stays home. If he comes, we're finished.
So?
They ask stupid questions... If we know Martin's mother or her boyfriend I told them I thought she and Titanic were a hot item.
What? !
-No, I'm joking.
I swore I knew nothing.
-Do they know anything?
I don't think so. Except for Clipman's theory.
Shhh.
Keep quiet.
You're late.
-Sorry. I forgot something.
Martin's safe.
-How do you know?
He told me everything, bonehead.
where is he?
-It's a secret.
Tell us. Come on.
Under one condition.
Spit it out, nerd!
That you stop teasing me.
No more 'nerd', 'kiss-ass', or 'teacher's pet'. Nothing.
OK.
-Swear it! OK, I'll keep my secret.
I may be a pain, but you're in serious trouble.
OK, I swear.
I swear.
-I swear.
Who the hell does she think she is?
No one tailed you?
How dumb do we look?
I don't trust anyone. That's why I'm...
An idiot!
-Shut up.
She bugs me.
-So find him yourselves.
Don't be mean.
-Apologize. Sorry.
-Sorry who?
Sorry, Helene.
That's all right, but next time it'll be worse.
Not bad, huh?
It's been abandoned for six years.
Ah Martin, you're here.
-This place is incredible, Martin.
I come here to be alone. Even my parents don't know about it.
Is that a hang glider?
-Yes, but it's not totally finished.
Lucky stiff.
You're much better off here than at school.
One day here is enough for me. I'm going home.
And this place is amazing!
You were hiding all this?
I didn't hide anything. You just had to look closely.
How did you find the time?
I may be a geek, but I get by.
Martin, you have to admit that this hide-out is awesome.
You can use the computer if you want.
I don't care about all this stuff, I'm going home.
They'll nab you.
-Good.
Off to the orphanage.
-Wherever.
Hey, don't scream.
They'll find my hide-out.
Maybe he's right.
-Shut your face.
Here I'm all alone.
-At your house too.
But it's my home.
I'm staying with you.
What about school? And your parents?
I'll run away. Again.
Are you sick or what?
-Leave her alone.
She'll attract the cops.
I don't need your permission.
No, stop...
No!
Go away!
Get out of here!
Go!
Marianne...
Marianne.
I'm such an ass.
You'll have to tell her that I'm sorry. That I'll do whatever she wants.
You'll remember?
-OK.
Parents aren't allowed to let us go out, cops at school.
We have to be careful. Someone will bring him food from all of us.
And the homework?
Homework too. Despite them, we'll go on as before.
Should we tell her what Martin said?
-No, things are tough enough.
Are you here to work or to play?
To play.
Hey guys, the cops found the hole! There's nothing in it now.
But where are you all going?
Move away. Don't stay there. Go on, go on.
Get back to school immediately.
I can't spend my time running after you.
You need the exercise!
Who said that?
What's more, he's deaf!
OK, get going!
Back to school. Get going.
Who among you know where Martin Gaudinier is hiding?
He must think we're really stupid.
Very well, let's be honest. I understand the pain your friend is going through
The death of a mother is an ordeal. I went through it myself.
But at the same time, I respected the rules of the society.
But how old were you at the time?
That's not the issue.
I want to help Martin.
We can't leave a child alone in such a situation.
There are risks.
Like what, sir?
Very many risks, believe me. I deal with them every day.
He's the biggest one!
A society is responsible for its minors.
First it will be necessary to keep Martin in a protective environment for his own psychological well-being.
But after some time, nothing will stop our putting him in a family.
And why not around here?
So you see, you can trust me.
Do you have any questions?
Sir, why is it forbidden to bury bodies wherever you want?
Especially because the cemeteries are supposedly full.
Don't ask stupid questions!
Have you ever arrested a criminal?
I'm not a policeman, I'm a judge for children.
That must be less fun.
And with his raincoat, he sure isn't Colombo!
That's enough. Where is Martin?
No one wants to answer especially in front of the others. That is why I'll leave a mailbox in your classroom.
You can each leave a message even in secret.
Antoine!
you're not going out?
I want some fresh air.
-The judge said to keep you inside.
Is this a prison?
Are you sure that he didn't kill her?
You're sick.
Don't you ever speak to me like that.
These days anything can happen.
Stay here.
Antoine!
Hi. No, I can't. Can you?
Jerome's allowed to go out.
Yeah, well, at least she's your real mother.
That's enough, Antoine!
Hang up and go to your room. Or else...
Talk louder because Steps won't stop shrieking!
Happy now?
Why are you like this?
What do you want?
Why don't you love me?
Hello, sir. I'm here on behalf of everyone else.
We think you're the only person who could adopt Martin.
Who?
Come in.
By the way, did you tell Martin that they found the clock?
Dummy! I can't get a word to him at the hide out.
We should at least go fill the hole. that way...
Where'd they put his mother?
-They buried her somewhere else.
It's easier for them.
You took so long, they all had to leave.
I know I'm in big trouble, so I've got nothing to lose. So?
It won't work. He can't adopt him because he's not married.
If it's just a question of finding him a wife...
And I swore not to say anything. Will you keep a secret?
Cross my heart!
He's homosexual.
Him?
Are you crazy?
He told me. And for adoptions, there's an investigation.
That's why it won't work. Also he'd have trouble.
That's disgusting?
-What?
That they give homos such a hard time!
What are we going to do?
-I don't know.
Are you still going out with Jerome?
Why?
-I don't like him.
Is there someone else you like?
-Yes.
Oh, that sucks.
-Why?
No reason.
-Come on. Say it.
No.
-Come on.
Well, if there wasn't already someone, I'd, I'd...
Jerome told me that you didn't like me.
What an ass.
To tell you the truth, I understand because if he likes you...
Do you like me?
-I think so.
You think I'm stupid?
Claire!
Claire!
I've been looking for you for an hour.
You were supposed to go home immediately.
I can't trust you anymore. And who is the boy?
A friend. I thought I could trust you too.
Would you like to walk a little with me?
Wait, I want to talk.
I want to go home.
Listen, I'm willing to understand everything.
Do you realize that I had to lie to the judge?
What for? He knows everything. -Watch your tone.
Get back inside.
Let me go. You're not my parents.
Get back inside immediately.
-I'm fed up. I'm leaving.
We weren't the ones lying all this time!
We thought you were sleeping at each other's houses.
We trusted you.
Maybe it's genetic, like they say.
But what do you have against me?
You're useless.
Nicolas is in charge of food.
Be careful.
Give it to Jerome. He'll give it to Nicolas.
Hello children Sit down!
Ah!
I see you've had some ideas.
WE DON'T TRUST YOU.
CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT, YOUR HONOR.
Claire, Julien, Jerome, Dede, come this way.
It's a piece of cake.
Come on, let's go.
We go that way. Walk slowly so Nicolas will have time to hide.
You go that way and we'll go over there.
Is it working?
Here comes Pierrot.
Helene, you're amazing!
Sorry for everything I said.
It was easy. what's more stupid than a policeman?
Two policemen!
And here they're 5 or 6.
Hey, hey! They've found him!
I didn't see that they followed me.
-Are you sure?
I was careful, I swear!
And Martin?
-They took him away.
At first he screamed, but the he gave in.
All that's left is to write a letter to the president.
Marianne...we forgot uh...we didn't have the time to tell you.
He even said that he would have liked you to stay with him.
Is it true?
You're not just trying to make me happy?
I swear! On my mother's head. My real mother's!
It's not too bad after all. I even have some friends.
The difference is that here, you have to know how to defend yourself.
Fortunately, I was able to steal a knife, and now I get respect.
No one cares about the classes.
It's a shame because I was starting to like them.
Be careful when you write back, because they read our mail.
No one read this letter, though. A teacher charged me 20 francs to mail it...
So, I'm getting by...
The judge doesn't want me to go back because he thinks I was traumatised.
The ass said that even if I'm adopted, he wants it to be in another city.
Anyway, I'm going to run away one of these days but now I'm being good so that you'll be able to come see me.
Quiet, or else you'll all return to your bus.
This visit is highly exceptional.
It was authorized by the judge in light of the ordeal suffered by Gaudinier.
Yet I must insist that absolute order be maintained.
Put your presents here on the table.
Come on.
I'll give them to him myself after your visit.
We can't do it ourselves?
-After your visit.
Hi.
-Hi.
How's it going?
-Great!
It's a neat place, isn't it?
We wrote to the president.
He hasn't answered yet, but...
How's Clipman?
He sends his love. He sent a present too.
That's nice. And Steps?
-She doesn't slap anymore.
Her new thing is:
'You'll be sorry when I'm gone.'
And school?
Same old thing. But this term we're all doing bad.
Even me.
That's normal. I'm not there to help you anymore.
Marianne, did they tell you?
Yes.
I tried something:
I complained that my fake parents were hitting me so they'd put me in an orphanage.
Maybe we would have been together.
You shouldn't have.
It didn't work. And now they really hit me.
You know, before...it was because I was a little afraid.
Of me?
Why?
There was already a throm broken in the family... So I thought I'd better watch out, you know, with girls. You see?
I'd never hurt you. I swear.
Do you think I can kiss him?
I put a file in the cake. In fact, the walkman is a walkie- talkie. That way we can talk.
Enough of this!
Move back or I'll throw you all out.
There's not that much longer to go. As soon as I'm an adult, everything will be fine.
That's a long time.
No, it goes by fast.
When we're adults, it'll be great.
Things will be different.
What?
What what?
Things. What things?
Everything. You'll see.
(woman) Aurora!
Hear me,
O Corambe. Corambe, thou who art man, woman and god in one, hear me.
I free this bird in thy name.
Come to me, sublime being.
I want to know the meaning of Iife. And I want to find perfect, perfect love.
I free this lizard in thy name.
Don't be dead.
(tuts) Oh, balls.
My little ritual in the woods didn't always go smoothly, but I was never discouraged and I never gave up hoping for an answer.
- That won't work.
- Fish are attracted to a bright colour.
Your fish will die of fear first.
- Are you coming?
- MaIIefiIIe will come looking for us.
- We're supposed to have our lessons.
- No, he won't. He's sleeping with Mummy. She doesn't get up till noon.
He's not sleeping with Mummy. She doesn't like him any more.
My love?
My soul?
- My sweet? - (knocking)
My heart?
(lock rattles) George?
George, please let me in.
Are you from the printers?
We've been waiting...
Madame Sand.
please excuse... (murmuring)
Madame Sand is on her way up.
Don't do that!
(whistles) It is rather far.
- I'II have to face her, that's all.
- alfred! I'II be perfectly behaved. Even a little scornful.
No, you won't. You'II be impossible.
I don't want a scene.
Now get in there.
And hurry up!
hello, George!
I wasn't expecting you till next month.
- How are the children, the country?
- Fine. Listen.
I need another 3,000 francs.
What happened to the advance you got?
You know my expenses. The children, the estate, my mother's nursing home...
The divorce took half of everything.
AII right. But let me have one more instalment first.
How? I've got no place to work.
What's wrong with the country?
MaIIefiIIe is there.
The children do need a tutor, but... I just can't stand the sight of him any more.
I tell him outright I want him to leave and he plainly refuses.
I'm a coward, of course. I can never simply boot my lovers down the stairs.
- Ha!
- What?
Why don't you stay here in Paris and write?
Because alfred's here.
I've got to go somewhere. Anywhere, I don't know.
Maybe I should just curl up and die, yes?
Listen, BuIoz.
I need 3,000 francs now.
Let me read this... and we'II talk tonight at the Baroness Laginsky's party.
I hadn't planned to attend. alfred might be there.
I know for a fact that he won't.
AII right.
- What's that?
- marvellous. - Her memoirs?
Am I in it?
- No! This bit's about her childhood.
You'II come in later, after she chews up her husband and a hundred others.
It's true. She's a cannibal.
She'd drink her children's blood from her lover's skull and not feel a stomachache.
alfred, go home. Put it into verse, I'II publish it.
Then you'II get paid.
Thanks to you I can't go to the baroness's party.
- In fact, I'II have to leave Paris.
- No more advances. I don't need your money, old sow.
I've had an invitation to the country. From a duchess, no less.
Good day.
This summer dust is ruinous to my lungs. I hope the air will be better in Angers.
The Duchess d'Antan has invited you too?
- well, yes.
- How delightful.
please continue, dear fellow.
- Good day, Countess.
- (gasps) George!
- I'm sorry I frightened you.
- (baby cries) I had the most fearful dream.
BIandine was a terrible creature with fly's wings that was draining my Iife from me.
They are deadly little charmers. Chromatic gIissando.
The wings of a butterfly.
Or the wrath of God.
(baby cries) He wakes the baby, then complains about the crying.
- How is Franz?
- He's a saint.
sublime. He'II even stay that way if you don't marry him.
Yes, well, there's no danger of that. The count won't divorce me.
Since I Ieft him, he won't even allow me to see the children.
well, now you've begun a new family.
still, I prefer to be married.
I know you thumb your nose at all that.
It's funny. I thought I'd die of suffocation when I was married.
Now it's my freedom that's killing me.
(baby cries) Sophie!
tell me, have you been invited to Angers next week?
The Duke and Duchess d'Antan have asked us to their estate.
(baby screams)
Sophie! Where is that wretch?
Excuse me.
Franz?
I will see you.
You're not going to Angers too?
Eugene! A whole fortnight among some tiresome old aristocrats.
A fortnight of free food, exquisite scenery and no bills.
And all you have to be is brilliant at dinner.
She doesn't seem bothered she's being eaten alive.
No.
She'd probably say "Better to feel something than nothing."
Even if it's teeth.
Madame Sand!
Oh, what a great honour you do my humble salon!
delighted to meet you, Baroness. I'm looking for my publisher, Monsieur BuIoz.
He's in the salon with the others, but you'II have to wait to go in.
I've so longed to meet you!
I knew your father when he was young.
- really?
- Yes. We girls were enraged when we heard he'd married that dancer.
- You mean my mother?
- Oh... of course.
- Is she still living?
- Yes. - But she's ill now.
- How sad. And what a tragedy your father died so young.
The Count de Saxe.
So dashing.
Those idiots!
Excuse me.
Not yet! (Baroness mutters angrily)
(souIfuI piano passage)
Madame Sand!
Is it true that you're writing a memoir?
- Do you pray, Baroness?
- If you must know, I'm secretly devout.
- Do you ever hear an answer?
- To my prayers?
There... is the answer.
Ah, you mean Monsieur Chopin.
How clever. It's very rare to hear him play, you know.
The Duchess d'Antan is having him for a whole fortnight at her house in Angers.
I couId only wish I were a fly on the wall.
Except that they already have crowds of files down there.
I do find the provinces beastIy.
- (applause) - Monsieur Liszt will play next.
- Ah, George.
I read your...
George!
You'II want to sit over here, my dear.
The respectable people are over there.
- could you point out Monsieur Chopin?
- Chopin?
But he left.
Don't you know him? He's frail as a holy wafer.
Look at those hypocrites. They've shunned me all evening.
I'm thrilled not to be one of them any more.
Their lives are so boring.
You see?
Every single one is throbbing for him.
They know perfectly well why I ran off with him.
For his teeth.
charles?
charles!
charles!
- (gunshot) - (gasps) Grab it!
darling!
charles!
charles! I've had the most extraordinary letter!
Madame George Sand is quite brazenly inviting herself to the fortnight!
You know the one.
She wears men's clothes and leads a most depraved life!
I'm dying to meet her.
charles?
She writes that marriage is barbaric, darling.
They say no marriage is safe around her.
Just think, she might take a fancy to your turkey wattIes.
Didier! Don't touch that!
Come here!
I'm in a quandary because I've invited alfred de Musset. Everybody knows he and Madame Sand practically tore each other to pieces. I'm petrified that if they so much as clap eyes on each other... (howIs with rage)
Has anyone ever met this duchess?
No.
Must be one of those titled tarts stuck in the provinces with an uncouth husband.
She's probably famished for culture and determined to import it at any cost.
charles!
- Where are you going?
- Hunting. - Goodbye.
I'II be back in a few days.
- But you can't! - Our guests arrive today.
- precisely.
You blockhead!
These are the great geniuses of our time, gathered together in our home!
They are a gang of parasites.
After a few days in their company, I expect you'II come to your senses.
You'II humiliate me if you don't receive them.
charles!
You don't want me to be a success!
Gustav?
Gustav!
Attach little bags of seed to the branches.
I want thousands of birds singing when they come up the avenue.
darling?
You're not dressed properly. Go and put on your pink waistcoat.
- (gunshot)
- Oh! That murderer!
There won't be a bird left in the sky!
welcome!
Yes. Come on, HeIene.
welcome!
In my house, you are the nobility.
The nobility of genius.
Madame Sand!
- hello. How was your trip?
- Madame Sand!
I'm melting with delight!
Oh, and you've brought your two boys!
- I'm a girl.
Here, Master DeIacroix. I have given you my own studio.
The light, you can see, is perfection.
When is Monsieur Chopin arriving?
Tomorrow. Or so he wrote to me in his letter.
Here is the theatre!
Sometimes we indulge ourselves in little amateur productions.
And here, Madame Sand, is your workroom.
If you open the doors, perhaps our southern moonlight will inspire you to write those sublime novels which I so admire.
George!
Up, quick!
We have food for a picnic!
And a donkey!
Come, before the dreaded duchess finds us.
Cheers.
Come on!
What is wrong with our Georgie?
She is incurably disgusted.
With what?
Love, no doubt.
She should only have what Marie and I have.
only God deserves love.
I adore this silence.
George has gone off, it seems.
- shall we go and look for her?
Not presently.
I need this rest. My tour next month is 20 cities.
- Where are you going?
- Vienna, Geneva...
You're going on a tour?
darling, did I forget to tell you?
What of your writing, your work?
What of me? Am I going with you?
We'II talk about it later.
We're going back.
Thank you, young man.
What a magnificent horse. Must have been a great hunter.
Yes.
Yes.
I'd invite you to my home for a drink, but I've got a house full of fops.
Guests of my wife's.
I won't let her move to Paris so she's trying to bring Paris here.
still, it's her money. And I Iove her for it.
(laughs)
Where are you staying, lad?
That is either Monsieur Chopin or Monsieur de Musset.
- You haven't invited alfred?
- I'm afraid so. Do you think it'II be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not alfred at all. This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- FeIicien MaIIefiIIe.
- He's the children's tutor.
- He can discipline those two savages!
I wonder where I shall put him, though.
In George's room, of course. That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
(Marie) He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.
- George!
- George!
I'II give you a horse to ride back to the inn.
- There's something I must confess.
We've been seen! Shit!
Not that one, monsieur!
By God!
What a fine seat that fellow George has.
Madame George Sand, dear. The authoress.
- Are you ready now to face me?
- God, MaIIefiIIe!
Not now! Yes, now.
No kisses?
Where's my greeting?
Didn't you get my letter?
Yes. Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.
- I will defend my position.
- Oh, balls!
You're not in the army any more.
You had an affair, not a pitched battle.
Oh, MaIIefiIIe. Poor boy. It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one. help me off with my boots.
He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!
Make that two epitaphs, because I'II kill you if I find...
Oh, my God, you're hurt!
You're bleeding.
Yes.
Be a dear. Ask UrsuIa if she's got something for a bandage.
Of course.
Don't move. No.
Bastard!
(yells) Oh, don't stop!
Monsieur Chopin, you were in the middle of a miracle.
I'm not quite yet cured. How did you get in?
Who are you?
I am your slave.
And you have summoned me with your music.
Oh, yes. I think I know who you are.
I have heard you described.
Madame Sand, rumour has it you are a woman, and so I must ask you to leave my private chambers.
Have I offended your modesty?
I apologise.
- play me one more piece and I'II go.
- This is ridiculously improper!
And frightening as well.
still, I am content. I've seen you at last.
And I am delighted to find you're not a man at all. You're an angel.
Hands, halo, wings... everything.
Good night, my dream.
My poor lady, you are a wreck.
I am a resurrected wreck.
Move over.
Citizen Maurice, the prisoner is ready for execution.
Viscount de Swamp, you are guilty of crimes against the people of France.
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
The king has escaped!
- Catch him!
- I will!
Tyrant! You will be brought to justice.
- Long live the republic!
- The king's guard!
We're surrounded. - We'II hold the king as hostage.
We'II shoot the viscount and throw them his body and demand their surrender.
Do we have enough ammunition to hold them off?
- I don't think so.
- I can help you. - My papa's got plenty of gunpowder.
- This could be very useful.
(girl) beautiful!
(both) Yes!
Good morning... master.
- Morning, excellency.
Ah. velvet flowers.
Did you make these, CIaudette?
I have a tiny talent and an enormous amount of time.
But have you come to work?
I will leave you in peace.
Oh, no. (giggles)
It's very bad.
No, don't!
Ooh!
That's really quite good.
One, two.
You're a fine shot, sir.
I can see you're not one of those perfumed prancers in there.
- What do you say to a little hunting?
- I am standing guard on my mistress.
That one? She doesn't need your protection, by God. Fascinating creature.
I'm sure she'd rather come hunting with us than sit around arranging her flounces.
"One warm word from you and I Iive. One brutal word and I die."
"It doesn't matter, for I am not afraid of death any more."
"I have already visited the beyond in your music."
- will you take it to him?
- Why don't you take it to him yourself?
I've been avoiding him all morning.
He's had a poor first impression of me, I fear.
Before I meet him again, I want him to be convinced of my complete sincerity.
well? What do you think?
Look, you know him. How will he respond?
I can't imagine any man resisting this prose.
It would melt the alps. But tell me, why do you pounce on our poor Chopin?
My dear, he's got one foot in the grave.
No, no. We shall all be in our graves soon enough. But Chopin is eternal.
The only permanent thing about him is his cough.
- AII right.
- Thank you, my friend.
Madame Sand, will you delight us with your company on a hunt?
I must decline, Your excellency.
My maid is fitting me for a dress this afternoon. A dress?
- Quick! - (fiinaI chord)
Perfect!
marvellous. darling, George proposes a game of croquet.
excellent idea.
Chopin will join us.
Oh, no. please excuse me. I do not really like the sun.
Hah!
Dear friend... I do not wish you to be burned.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, my friend. May I speak with you?
Something very terrible has happened.
- Oh!
Again.
- George seems more cheerful.
- Mm. She has a crush on Chopin.
The polish corpse?
- They couldn't be more different.
- Then they will definitely fall in love.
I suppose as friends we should help them along.
absolutely not!
Franz, you and I must put ourselves between them at every opportunity.
- Marie! Your turn.
He is so frail, darling.
You know George will finish him off.
- The countess made advances to you?
- She is my friend's mistress.
- She has borne his child. - He wouldn't mind if she changed hands.
really, I don't understand the attitude of you people.
Are we at a livestock sale?
She's a woman, not a goat.
- Are you in love with her yourself?
- Of course not. "I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities."
"I Iove, that is all."
"But I Iove strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."
No, it's like something out of a novel...
like that dreadful woman writes.
- If you can call her a woman.
She makes a great hash of her life, but she's got a good heart.
That's why so many men don't want to let go of her.
George knows how to love... while she loves.
The countess has an extraordinary style.
I'd not have guessed there was a volcano under that ice.
We can't find anything, citizen.
The viscount has been completely obliterated.
- Good to see you.
- Good evening.
They're all in here.
What the devil...
Good God, CIaudette!
Go back upstairs and change!
- Pooh!
- Ow! hello!
welcome. well, he left the salon at that moment.
CIaudette's decided to dress as a man for some reason.
At that stage everyone started to laugh.
At last!
Madame Sand!
Everybody's staring at me. It's a revelation wearing trousers.
I feel quite the bully!
George in a dress?
Red and white, the colours of the polish flag.
That's a bit of overkill.
I tell you, we'II discuss it...
May I take your arm?
My husband's in a temper tonight because I'm wearing his britches.
George, Chopin does not deserve to be collected.
He's so fragile, you know he might...
What's this?
A secret? Is he the one you came here to meet?
MaIIefiIIe, if you can't behave, go to your room.
I am quite marooned.
will you... partner me?
Of course.
- Bon appetit.
- (all) Bon appetit.
I understand many of you artists are atheists.
Atheists?
Oh, no.
No, we feel that God exists. He's just not considered worth all the trouble of denying him.
Oh, really!
The baron is baiting you.
He maintains there is no scientific evidence of God. And I reply "Because civilisation has poured dust on his traces."
God has been buried by science.
But alive!
God exists. But he is no Ionger loved, so he hides away to conceal his broken heart.
(sympathetic murmurs) certainly it is difficult to find God in our age. And artists are the only hope.
But we shall locate him again.
We are a search party, if you Iike, of orphans, with our emotions as a lantern in the dark.
(amused murmuring) Our greatest hope may be Monsieur Chopin, in whose music we find both emotion and science in the most perfect rapport.
(guests) Hear!
Hear! Thank you.
May I, in turn, propose a toast to our host and hostess?
For without the noble patronage of the aristocracy, we are orphans indeed.
They understand and nurture us.
They are our model and inspiration.
George, you're not drinking.
You must pardon Madame Sand. She is allergic to the aristocracy.
surely that can't be!
Madame Sand, my hobby is genealogy, and if I am correct, you are a baroness by marriage and your father's mother was a countess.
really? Yes, but my mother's father was a bird-seIIer.
There you are, philosopher.
Scientific proof of God.
The lion may lie down with the Iamb, and the baroness with the bird-seIIer.
(laughter) Since you must know birds, Madame Sand, what do you think of our local partridge?
We flushed four of them in a field this afternoon. Your friend MaIIefiIIe here shot three of them.
I only wounded the Iast one.
It flew away. I don't know how it could fly - one wing was nearly torn off.
When we were wandering back, we saw it thrashing about in the garden.
The dogs had got it!
One of the bitches had bitten off its head.
- Feathers were flying everywhere...
Now see what you've done!
What the devil's the matter with him?
He has trouble with his lungs. Makes a misery of his life.
He should be bled.
We have an excellent physician.
He's developed a special variety of leeches.
painless, and they leave very little mark.
Better yet, send in George to Monsieur Chopin.
She leaves no mark at all.
Hungarian humour, George.
(crash)
- You are too familiar.
apologise.
- Sit down, you ass! - You think I don't know what's going on?
- She has made love with Monsieur Liszt?
apologise or I'II rip your throat out!
apologise!
- Agh!
alfred! - St George!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the dragoon.
I was invited. Duchess, I've only just arrived.
Thank God I was in time to defend Madame Sand's honour.
- You followed me.
- He's the one? - You're starting up with him again?
- I'd sooner chew glass.
Choose your seconds and meet me at dawn, sir.
- No more duels! - This is men's business.
- I accept.
- Men? You're not fit to be men!
Morons! Idiots!
Choose your weapons, MaIIefiIIe.
Leave her alone!
She's going off to write about us.
It's time for her nightly regurgitation.
20 pages. The only reason she needs you or me or anybody is to provide characters for her ghastly novels!
- I trust you have no objection to pistols.
- What?
- For tomorrow. - My boy, I really don't care.
Thank you for the Ioan, my dear. It was most instructive.
You'II be up before dawn for the duel, so I shall sleep in my own bed.
Ooh! I do wish I couId be there tomorrow.
You will make sure nobody's killed?
I abhor killing, but a good fight's something to see.
- Good night. - Good night, CIaudette.
- Good evening.
(gasps)
(gasps and pants)
What do you...
Shh.
Show me your tongue.
- (horse snorts)
Oats de cologne.
Mm.
(grunts)
Damn it.
Let's go and see.
(George screams)
- Goodbye, George. I'm going to my death. - What are you ranting about?
- But before I die...
- Oh, my God!
- One kiss from you is all I ask.
- What are you doing? Let go of me.
Get that horse out of here. Shh.
I will be dead soon.
MaIIefiIIe is going to shoot me. (gasps) You two can't be serious.
please. please, alfred, don't go.
Um... - I'II talk to MaIIefiIIe.
- No.
- I want to die.
I nursed you when you were sick. Yes.
And then you fucked the doctor.
You were sick because you'd been out every night screwing all the whores in Venice while I was sitting at my desk writing so that we had a...
- (laughs hysterically)
- Oh! The horse is a critic!
Get out! kill yourself, I don't care!
I hate you!
And... One.
Two.
Three.
Four. Five.
Six.
Seven.
Mummy said we can't go till the roads dry up. But it's been raining for three days now. It's no use.
We're prisoners. Prisoners of the bastille. Guards are everywhere.
- We'II blast our way out. - Yes! (plays IistIess, melancholic piece)
(sighs)
Monsieur Chopin, it sounds so like the raindrops, it's quite magical, but I must ask you to produce a little sunshine for us instead.
I'm about to go mad with the sound of horrid rain, day in, day out.
ordinarily I would just take a bromide and go to bed, but one has guests to entertain.
Rather, it is our turn to entertain you.
- I've just written a play for your theatre.
- Oh, how gay! Eugene will paint the scenery. The maids can do the costumes.
- Chopin will provide an accompaniment.
- delighted.
We'II play the parts and you will enjoy this tribute from your grateful geniuses.
- Noah and the flood.
- (laughs) How appropriate!
I don't know what God sees in him. I hate those things.
Can I see that?
You don't remember them because you didn't write them!
I can't remember them because they're shit! (arguing)
Ah, children.
You are wanted in the theatre. Now!
There you are!
You must hurry. Hurry up! Get into your costumes!
Our artists have been up all night making their costumes.
It's terribly exciting! You're not acting in this piece? I have no stomach for farce.
I am here to cue you. When I signal you Iike so, you must play something which suggests rain.
I expect this will be very amusing.
Yes.
alfred and George have really outdone themselves this time.
(knocking)
- Good evening.
I am God.
I have grown disappointed in my master creation, the human race.
I endowed them with everything. The riches of the land, sea and air.
And enough intelligence to worship me. But they have become arrogant and pampered.
AII except for one man and his family.
(Duchess) Ah!
This is my servant Noah and his wife Noette and their children.
Into their hands do I place the future of mankind. Oh, this heat!
will it never rain? Here sits my stupid Iout of a husband. I don't know what God sees in him.
Ah, who can express the despair of youth married to age?
My husband is 600 years old while I am but 150!
A dove!
Ha! What luck! There will be good hunting today!
Look! It has begun to rain!
Stupid, stupid rain!
Yes, I have sent the stupid rain to fall upon the earth and stupidity shall engulf all its inhabitants.
Hurry now to the ark and fill it with two each of the creatures of land, sea and air.
Lord, we have no need for animals.
Art alone will save the world. We'II need two of everything.
They will not come - your conversation is not witty and you have no ideals.
(laughs) True.
But we shall also give them free food and lodging for 40 days and nights.
We shall also need two playwrights, two composers, two makers of velvet flowers.
Now you go too far. But it is an art, surely. Noette, come quickly!
I want no further part of this production!
Madame Sand, you insult our hosts.
Do it the way you did it last time.
Something that makes me look a little younger, please.
You always look young to me.
Perhaps I should chop it all off like you.
Except that I'm not that crazy.
Aurora, surely you can afford a dress by now.
I've got used to trousers. They're comfortable and I can move around.
Can you feel that draught?
It comes straight through that wall.
I've told you before, Mama. Don't stay here. - Come back with me to Nohant.
- No, I want to be in Paris. Besides, you don't need my company.
You have that young man.
What's he called?
MaIIe...
MaIIe...
- MaIIefiIIe. - MaIIefiIIe!
- A very dashing fellow.
- I wish he'd fall off the map.
You're always looking for something better, Aurora.
If you'd stayed married, you'd have money.
- You shouldn't beg for scraps like I did. - I'm doing fine.
The only money I ever saw was what your grandmother paid me not to see you. You didn't have to take it.
That's rather nice.
You only just got back.
It's humiliating! I know you.
Six weeks means six months.
My concerts raise money for the refugees.
The floods this year were devastating. It's my country, these are my people and they need me.
suddenly you're the patron saint of Hungary!
I couldn't stand between you and mankind.
I'II return as soon as I can. My beautiful archangeI.
I'II miss you.
(baby cries)
I gave up everything for you.
I disgraced myself for our dream, Franz.
AII I wanted was to kneel at your feet.
- Don't start, Marie.
- Inspire you to write music.
- I can't get anything done here!
- Nor anywhere! You're impotent!
- musically, that is.
- Get up! You're a performing bear!
Are the countess and Monsieur Liszt at home?
Is that the new baby? She's adorable.
Can I hold her?
darling.
- Countess! - hello, George.
I just saw the new baby. She's adorable.
Was it a difficult labour? Very.
What brings you to Paris?
- My mother's ill.
- Oh. I've been so depressed.
Seeing friends again will do me good.
How's Franz? He's very well.
Have you seen the charming Chopin?
No.
- Why do you ask? - Marie... I've tried so hard to put him out of my mind.
You want him very badly.
For a few heavenly minutes I thought I had him, too. In Angers, remember, I wore that dress. Our eyes met...
You won't get him with a dress. On the contrary, my dear. I know the man.
He's all emotion and refinement.
He has very few defences.
A woman is always on the point of abandoning herself anyhow.
It only takes one firm push.
You are sublime!
A true friend.
Those are marvellous. Yes. This is from...
Thank you.
And I want something with a much thinner, narrower line.
Yes, that is good, I think.
In fact, you could make this even more...
No, I don't want this.
Take it off, please. You are so good to escort me tonight.
people shun me unless I am on the arm of someone respectable.
You will find nothing but friends at Eugene's. Friends? Ha!
I wonder if George will be there.
She has the most alarming way of turning up everywhere I go.
I'm beginning to find it unnerving.
She has a desperate purpose.
What do you mean?
A while ago she was out drinking and gambling - she leads a rough life - and she boasted that...
socially she is too bizarre, but somehow I find her very compelling.
I wonder if she is different when alone.
She boasted that you are to be her next lover.
well, you know she's eternally in need of money.
Here we are.
You have the most priceless expression on your face.
There's MaIIefiIIe. We can be sure George is here. He's still following her like a tall.
darling, it's so good to see you. - I didn't know you'd be here.
- I didn't either. (chatter and laughter)
No.
Dear friend, I am just a musician.
What do I know? They...
They are very... - Are you ill?
- No. I only wish to lie down for a minute.
I have a room just to the side where you can relax.
It's all right, everyone.
She's going to be all right.
- What do you suppose is wrong?
- She's probably pregnant again. There's George. Excuse me.
I have no desire to speak to that woman.
Chopinsky!
You hiding from George too?
You would know the reason.
I don't want to spoil a good drunken stupor by imagining your reason.
Ever since the latest chapter of her egregious memoir was published, I can hardly show my face anywhere.
Did you read her latest novel? It's not literature, it's drainage. She only wrote good books when she was with me.
He'd have rather cleaned out the bloody stables.
Know what's funny?
- She doesn't come.
She makes a Iot of pretty noise, but she can't come. Like her books - Iovesick posturing and pretence for quick money.
Oh, what a whore she is.
This is despicable.
You are drunk.
My only regret is that I didn't put 20 francs on the mantelpiece the first time.
I can assure you, monsieur, that Madame Sand will gain no money from you on my account.
Hm?
(jaunty music)
Eugene!
Where's angel fingers?
I've lost him. - He's taking the Countess d'AgouIt home.
- Oh.
If you plan to invade poland, you should know that the countess has placed her troops at the border.
What did it say? Marie's jealous of you.
She couldn't stand it if you got a better composer than hers.
I don't know why I dress up. Nothing here but old men.
You should bring that MaIIefiIIe fellow with you. - He's at Nohant tutoring the children.
- So you took my advice and kept him.
No. It's all over with us.
- What does he say to that? - Oh...
He threatens to kill me and himself if I leave him. He's been reading too many of your books!
- Let's stop here.
- Mama, it is too cold for you here.
No, it's a lovely day.
Why should the Iast thing I see be a priest with the face of a dustbin?
I'm not afraid to stand before my maker.
God can accuse me of many things, but I defy him to say I haven't loved him. Yes.
Yes, that's pretty. Now the ribbons, hm?
No, it's too heavy.
Yes, in a bow.
So hot.
will you be going back to Nohant?
always running off alone in the woods.
AII the servants out calling "Aurora!" Aurora?
- Where did you go?
- In the woods?
I wasn't going anywhere. I was just running.
Mama?
Mama?
Good.
I think it's just a question of joining them together... Iegato. simplicity is the hardest thing.
It's the final thing.
well, er...
- Next week, then?
- Yes.
Baroness Dudevant? I don't think I know her.
well, send her in.
This is the first time I've found a use for my title.
I'II give you exactly one minute.
I am leaving Pa... (plays "Minute waltz")
I am leaving Paris.
You can't have failed to notice I've been pursuing you. I'm in love with you.
I don't know you at all...
(stops playing)
I don't know you at all, but I know this:
you are great.
You have made a single instrument speak the language of God.
And I wanted to Iearn it from your lips, you see.
You don't want me and... it's become complicated, Iike everything between two people.
It seems to me a pity, because it could have been so simple.
I'm begging you to give this up.
I know that you're in need, with your children and your mother's funeral.
surely you realise she wants you for herself?
- Dear lady, please... - Don't worry, I'm going! She's right.
(knock at door)
- (MaIIefiiIIe) George?
- Is madame at home, please?
- Madame?
please excuse me. - Sophie!
There's no more. I'm empty.
That's the Iast you'II get from me.
- I will return another time.
You haven't visited me for a Iong time.
My health has been hateful. Franz is away. AII the royal houses of Europe have invited him to play, it seems.
Even Russia.
Like most peasants, he has a weakness for crowned heads.
You may turn around. please sit.
Thank you.
Do you hear anything from Madame Sand? - will she be coming to Paris this year?
- I am no Ionger her friend.
She severed herself from Franz and me with no explanation.
- You have her latest book, I see. - Yes. - Have you read it?
- I wouldn't touch such trash.
Madame, last summer you gave me a letter. Yes, I took a chance... you would forgive me speaking the truth of my heart.
In fact, I was appalled.
But I couId not reject it entirely. Something touched me.
A phrase, Iike a tune one can't forget. - shall I remind you what you wrote? - Do.
"I am not full of virtues and noble qualities."
"I Iove, that is all."
"But I Iove strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."
Imagine my surprise when I found that here.
I see I must confess.
When I wrote you that letter, my tender feelings for you so overpowered me
I couId not find words of clarity and persuasion. I was desperate.
But a year ago this book had not been published.
Or even written, I suspect.
I think I've found the truth, for which I thank you, and I owe Madame Sand an apology.
Perhaps now she and I can become friends.
Don't be content with just a little truth.
George will never be content with just your friendship.
She wants your manhood.
Your virtue, your genius, your soul.
Listen to me! That woman is a graveyard!
But I can help you. I can inspire you.
- It's a bit on the thin side. - So's my Iife.
(sighs)
- I'm not happy with it.
Because a perfect impromptu should seem spontaneous and free.
No-one should be able to guess at the desperate calculation behind it.
I've been struggling with this for so long.
I have terrible dreams at night. I think if I ever finish it, then it will have finished me.
You must suffer tortures to find the perfect word that will make it all seem effortless.
Suffer for art? You must be joking.
I suffer quite enough for life.
I have no hope to be perfect.
I simply pump out pages for money.
No, your books are admirable. I've been reading them.
No-one expects me to live very long.
- I beg your pardon?
Look, I don't believe you're ill at all.
Take mine.
really. I have too much of it.
- No. - Yes. I want you so.
- No. - Oh!
Forgive me.
I... fear that we would harm the memory of our beautiful afternoon.
Yes.
AII right.
Who's taught you to be afraid?
No wonder you're choking to death.
Someone's got to show you how to breathe.
Come on.
Come on. You need light and air.
You need to move about.
Why stay inside wrestling with perfection? Come outside!
Run, Chopin! - Excuse me?
- Yes.
I won't kill you here as you deserve.
I will kill you honourabIy at dawn tomorrow.
With any weapon you prefer. You wish to fight me?
You have stolen my lady's affections.
- I wish the chance to avenge myself.
- (George) MaIIefiIIe!
No!
Very well, monsieur.
I will give you the opportunity.
But not the prize.
This is ridiculous.
What, run for my hole like a rabbit?
Nor could you, Aurora.
I'm going to fight at dawn for the right to see another dawn.
- Eugene.
- It's too late.
He's in love. Monsieur.
Madame. welcome.
The doctor is here.
These are my seconds.
please.
I wonder... Is there by any chance a cleaner one?
- He is not much more than a cloud. I'II come back to you.
I'II never see him again.
Just stop these silly heroics.
You have placed me in an impossible position.
AII I have left is a show of strength.
Besides, women like that sort of thing.
Pretty dress.
Are you ready, gentlemen?
And... one.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Wait!
Come back!
It's the frail one!
Oh, my God!
Is he dead?
I hope the damp hasn't killed him.
- Show us your finest room.
- I have one ready.
Give him milk when he wakes up.
Try not to excite him.
- gentlemen, do I have your word? - Yes.
And you, monsieur?
You're a menace to the future of art.
Goodbye.
Remember what the doctor said.
Try not to excite him. - He needs peace. - I know what he needs.
Go home.
Paint something dead.
- Aurora?
- Yes.
I feel very weak.
- Have I been wounded?
And then I fell?
You were overcome by...
the violence of what you'd done.
You're a sensitive man.
- I remember the gun was shaking so. - You see?
You're stronger than you knew. And I thought you needed me.
But I do need you.
Why don't we stay here for a few days?
It's discreet.
Chopin. Do you love me?
God help me, I do.
You are superb.
Don't.
I'm frightened.
Of me? Certain acts are unseemly. They are unsuitable.
Chopin.
It's an act of love.
It's the divine mystery itself. You must think I'm inexperienced, but I assure you,
I was baptised in the brothels of Paris when I first arrived.
But, um...
I'm so ill, and I have been for such a Iong time, and my body is such a great disappointment to me that I've already said goodbye to it.
I'm not really in it any more.
I'm just happier floating about in music.
And if I should come back inside this miserable collection of bones, then I am afraid that it wouId probably collapse altogether.
Forgive me.
I'm a fraud, you know.
I've never experienced that with anyone.
I've always had disastrous relationships. - I've never managed to stay in love.
- Why?
I don't know.
I want too much.
I think. Except when I hear you play.
And when I'm around you.
I simply want to be with you.
(baby screams)
Sophie!
will you please take them for a walk?
Throw them in the Seine!
So George has caught another butterfly.
He hasn't fallen in love.
He has succumbed to her.
The poor man was simply standing there and was crushed under her wheels.
It's not too late.
Franz, you must go over at once and talk to him.
excellent. Thank you.
That is perfect.
Thank Monsieur ViIIon for me.
We can be off. Franz.
I...
I didn't know you were back.
- Countess.
- You're going out?
Er, yes, I'm just leaving.
The Etudes are published. I didn't know.
Let's have a listen. could you take those downstairs for me?
And this trunk has to go. (starts playing)
Franz, Chopin's going out.
We'II come with you so we can talk.
I'm going to meet Madame Sand.
- You play it better than I. You're going on a trip?
Chopin is going to meet Madame Sand.
He once had his own experience with George.
- Marie, I told you nothing happened.
- So you love to claim. You must listen to him, because, one way or another,
(George) I've always wanted to know.
See here, darling. Chopin has dedicated the Etudes to you. To me?
It is a tremendous honour.
What did you do to deserve it, I wonder?
Marie is an angel of inspiration.
It's good to see you, Franz.
You should come back to Paris more often.
We all get into such trouble when you're away.
Where are you taking him?
For a Iong time now I have blamed myself for your unhappiness and suffering.
And when I think of the music I might have written if not for the guilt which has murdered my vitality all these years!
But Chopin has seen a happier side of you, it seems.
You can't think that I...
that he and I were lovers?
I'm not sure it was a good idea of yours dedicating the Etudes to her.
They're running away together!
It's a catastrophe!
- It sounds like fun to me.
Ever the wily peasant you are.
- Taking them?
- No Dr. Gachet's place?
He won't arrive until the 7 o'clock train
Know a cheap boarding house?
Ravoux's. That's the only one
You needed the next stop, Ravoux's is closer to Auvers
- Glass of wine?
- I don't drink
Wait!
Don't go like that. No suitcase?
I'll store all this and go with you.
- You're no talker.
- I am...
- What are you doing in Auvers? - Nothing
That's restful
You're in Auvers for the air.
I'm the railroad company agent in Chaponval
Whole family's on the railroad.
Trains put me to sleep as a baby
Dad was a stationmaster I couldn't pass the test.
There's Ravoux's.
If there's a room she'll take you. But it's simple.
I'm not picky
Buddy here needs a place 3.50 francs room and board, drinks extra.
- I don't drink
- He lives off his rotgut.
Want to see the room?
Bread and wine...
Here you are. Clean.
Fresh sheets once a week, you make your own bed A big cloest for your stuff A view of the sea?
Lean out, you see the beach
Pretty port
Auvers-sur-Oise is a charming town
Vessenots Street
There's Dr. Gachet Tightwad took a cab!
"Hippety-hop... "
- Taking it? - It's fine...
- Going to Gachet's?
- Yes, where is it?
Vessenots Street, And the bags?
I'll send for them tomorrow.
Still the right hand...
Change your pedal... hold it...
There!
Then it shifts...
Right hand...
There...
Let up on it... softly...
Very good, Marguerite.
You have talent Too bad you stopped
I stopped when mother died. I'll start again
I hope so
Play "Lakme" for me
I can't play "Lakme"
Play "Lakme" Marugerite
You won't play it?
It makes me cry I had a monkey named Lakme
And?
It's gone?
Dad put it in a zoo, said it was too dirty
- Let the teacher play it
- No Odd, to love a monkey
- It's not for tonight
Let's go on
We'll do staccatos
You're a bit late
I took the 3 o'clock train
I mean late in the season The lilac's going to leaf
Come in
Sit down
I expected you in my office... in Paris
I don't see patients here
I've a note from my brother
I'm not set up here We'll manage with what's at hand
Undress
My drawers too?
Keep them on
Need a napkin, Dad? Smells good...
Stew?
- It's not for tonight
- No, tomorrow
Lie on the couch
Sit on the table
Stare at me
Describe your fits
Go on
They vary
Recall the strongest?
The last one
How long ago?
Nearly 3 months
Time of day?
At night. 2 or 3 a. m. I'd just fallen asleep
How long before?
Half and hour I woke with a raging headache
Where?
There. I'd never felt such pain
It lasted at least 20 minutes A cold compress helped a bit
Did it return?
Not entirely
Bearable. And now?
I have a steady dull cahe
Now and then it vanishes, for a while
No pain... behind the eye?
Back of the neck?
Always on the side...
- ... you showed me?
- Yes, there
I have others, like everyone but they're different
How do you know?
Who's that guy?
I'm not kept informed A painter, I think
That so?
Here for rest and treatment
Can't he rest here?
We have room
Must I spell it out?
Great engraving. First printing
See how the blacks stand out?
Superb! And the central figure, remove it and it's a routine picture
I needn't tell you that
It's by Meryon I'd like to have treated him
He was really sick
- Dad, I took some of your books
- My son, Paul, "Coco" to us
Do I... inform your brother?
- What do I owe you?
- I'll settle it with him
He's not here. How much?
7 francs all right?
- Need lodgings?
- It's done
Where, if I may ask?
The cafe near the station
Ravoux's, It's simple.
How much? 3.50 francs
I understand
Let's eat
Your sister's late, as usual
He's odd I showed him my Renoir
What's for dinner?
Rabbit
- Where's the wine from?
- Duval's
It's not the greatest
I was saying he ignored my Renoir A doctor shouldn't always discuss painting
He should think of other things
What?
You haven't eaten?
- I can serve you some soup
- I'd like that
Dinner here's at 7 o'clock
Sit on the other side, it's quieter
- You still here?
- I haven't budged
I don't drink
Your napkin ring It's the prettiest
You don't dose it?
People think that means pouring wine in the soup and stirring
No, you save just a bit of broth ...add a good spoonful of wine
That's how I do it
It's called dosing in my Mom's town, spiking in my Dad's
Yet they're only 20 miles apart
Dad calls a funnel a "fontel"
In Mom's town it's a "tunner"
Where's your Mom from?
She's dead and buried
Life's funny My brother's first post was at Penglon, near the grave site...
The big curve before the river. There's a railroad crossing
The Clermont express roars by. Every year it runs over someone
No, don't
- I thought you were asleep
- No, I needed some air
What'll I do with this?
You'll see
God any soup?
Here's some
It's easier to wash at the pump in the yard
Did you hear me?
. I heard you
- I'm Adeline. I'm 13
- I'm Vincent
What're you writing?
To my brother
You write often?
May I read it?
Too bad...
My grandson wants to chat
My grandson wants to talk to you
I'd like you to do my portrait
- What?
- I want you to paint me
Go home, grandpa
Come have a drink
- Your health
- And yours
To health and wealth
Wealth
Here he comes...
What's up?
What?
My portrait
Like it?
The blue?
Want your portrait in blue?
Smile
Life isn't so bad, there's even room for the village idiot.
I'll cost you 2 sous
I got no money
Take it and scram
Scram!
...Cezanne can't stand me. Called us "Gauguin and Van Gag"
- Among aritists, that's mild
- I don't call him "seize-anes"
"16 asses" I never thought of that
That's my house
Cezanne throws a lot away, like all great painters.
Do you? Never My family does it for me
My Guillaumin but I've no frame for it
- You don't paint nudes, right? - I can't afford models A little Seurat
How'd you get it?
He doesn't let sketches out of his studio
It's a copy I made In scret. I'm proud of it
- The scret or the work?
- Both
The hanged man's house
It's called that but no one hanged there. It had to do with the owner's name
He's improved since then
I'll show you the finest..
That's really painting!
And how!
Cezanne was about to scrape it. I stopped him
I never scrape
Only once, "Christ in the Garden of Olives"
That so?
- My daughter, Marguerite
- Nice flowers in your room...
- What? - The painting
I want one of yours soon
Well, they're cheap
Mrs. Chevalier!
My Paris friend let me down tonight. Come to my room?
You get what I mean?
- What's this dirt?
- It's a spot I can see that!
It's rust Don't worry, you can't see it
I can. A new dress!
Lovely old lace from Aunt Francia Hand-me-downs
You're pretty as a princess
If only your Mom were here
She's not!
Want some tea?
I don't like it
We never see you It's so long since you came 2 days ago
Seems like ages to me You're so hesitant
I've watched you. You hesitate over the simplest things
In fact, you do as you please
How do you want me?
Like that. Play
I've a headache
Want some quinine?
Bring Mr. Van Gogh some quinine
All right. Let's go on
Don't feel like painting?
No, I don't
Yet I was told..
Who told you?
I'm not a machine
Sorry
I mean it. Your simpering bores me.
Play At least you don't pull faces like a virtuoso
Maybe bacause you're not one
You mean I play badly?
That's not for me to say
My sister Mina plays well. Or so I thought at home
Is she pretty?
What do you care?
Feminine rivalry "She's prettier than me?"
You're cranky with everyone Must be a strain
No, I'm happy as a lark. Now play
Hold that pose
- You smiling?
- Yes Not too much
Why are you here?
Simplicity is so difficult
We'll lunch outside ... in 15 minutes
Never changes!
At home, my mother and sister always interrupted my work
To eat their lousy Dutch chow
Mother yelled "It's cold" or "It'll burn!" My sister came never looked at my work
- Women only care about material things.
- Don't be unfair
My late wife valued painters' work
She adored Cezanne
It hurt her that I was just an amateur
The "chow" here's not bad.
Mrs. Chevalier's quite the cook except for my mother
It's ready
Marguerite's posing Mr. Van Gogh's painting
Eating's more important than painting
You can live without painting but without food... you die
If I had a cook, I'd let her cook I'd rather listen to you
So you say, but it's not true
When the food's ready you chomp at the bit
Lunch is served!
Come anyway
Coming
Each year he takes Coco and me to the company fair
The railroad band plays classics
It's a bit boring
Last year there were ballet stars from the Opera
They danced to Grieg's "Solveig's Song"
- You like Grieg? - Don't know him
My life's silly. I've the right to read, Dad's liberal
Using what I learn is another matter A girl's called a tomboy on her looks, not how she feels
We have to hide our feelings. Men are lucky They aren't restricted
We spend all those days shut in wanting to live.
All we can do is...
Is...?
Embroider
Painting's my embroidery
Go on, make fun!
Idle rich girls are the worst
At least working girls work
You've lived in England
Seen those suffragettes protest?
I don't like those marching women
I don't like to bite or being bitten I wage my revolt in private
Much good it does me!
I'm tired of playing
Take the pose!
No more piano!
- Take the post
- Then it's no pose
Want to know what I think?
I don't care
I love grouchy painters!
My dress isn't like that
You made it leaden. The train drags and my hands are claws!
It's all nonsense
The colors are like puke!
And your landscapes!
You serious?
Is this a pictorial disagreement?
Pose and shut up. Models have no say in how pictures are exucted
The very word!
You're a pest! Our guest kindly offered to paint you...
- I'm not talking to you!
- Enough!
Sure, treat me like your dog!
Hotblooded, like her mother
MY late wife treated our painter friends better
This generation is hopeless
Admirable! That's the word!
The muted mauve, the rhythem, background, hands, the swirling skirt...
It weighs a ton!
...like a wave, Vincent.. may I call you Vincent?
Painting is making a great leap with you
How can we keep up with you?
Good news. I went by the gallery and invited your brother
The whole family's coming Sunday
I met your sister-in-law Johanna
Theo's a lucky dog Admirable woman!
Such a gentle look yet strong, almost violent
In a positive sense, of course
I venture to think their marriage troubles you
You fear it may affect your close realtions with your brother so fruitful for your work
...will strengthen your ties
Or in fact, restore them in a calmer, more ample situation
I truly feel this
It's what I wish for the three of you
I don't like mauve. I wasn't wearing mauve Neither was the wall
You paint me from behind Never look at me head-on
Why not from the front?
Don't I inspire you?
I'm no goddess, but am I that purple lump on a purple ground?
Look who's here!
We meet again We met in Arles
I'm glad to see you
Stop, that's mine!
Yours?
Impossible
It is. I just paid her for it
All the more reason.. She forgot her belt
It's a small world.
When I heard I thought, "it must be him"
How's your illness?
It's OK, Cathy
- I'm glad - It's OK
How we talked!
I love talking to you
You bored here?
I can come and see you It's better in the country
Am I still so stingy?
Give me another, that one's...
It's wet. Want your shirt?
There...
Leave the bottle
It's Tockay But warm
I put it in the spring but the heat...
Here
What've you been up to?
A 5-year Legion hitch 4 really I was discharged
I tried to enlist in the Legion
You wouldn't have lasted a week
- You like bang-bangs
- I like weapons. You scared?
Gives me a laugh
Best thing for blowing your brains out
For cowards
It depends...
My captain Captain Longot surrounded by Germans, with the dead around him knowing what they'd do to him, he didn't hesitate!
What's going on?
You scared me.
Takes guts!
Coming?
Big-hearted
Most whores rush the client
I'm no whore
Three lays at my age, the monster's tired
How old are you?
- Guess -40-45
You burned yourself out
And how!
You put it all into your work left nothing for the rest
The rest counts most!
You a philosopher, too?
Not at all, but...
I've my way of talking
- And Sonia, in Arles? - You liked Sonia, eh? - Well?
- She went like that, phtt!
- You mean..?
- She's dead
I love being naked in the country
Especially in summer, the rain's warm, I roll in the grass
It's terrific!
The leaves stick to the skin
I didn't want to tell you in Arles...
What?
Spit it out!
But that night when you...
I god a bad name!
But I know how you really are
And last year, remember?
When you scared me so?
I should't have let you go like that. I wonder how you got home.
I do, too.
You were alone
I remember nothing
You could've let me know. I thought you'd died
We do nothing for fear of scandal
We're cowards, it makes me sore!
That's how the worst things happen, which you regret forever
But you can't always face up to trouble
I'm not the remorseful type, but when I think of it... I'm ashamed
Never mind, it's over now
Were you on something?
I said it's over
Hey, I can't see a thing!
I just went...
Aren't you ever happy with a man?
Why not?
My husband...
- Your husband?
- Yeah, I was married
It was fine, now it's over
I can't do it with the guy I live with
You're the only one
I'd like to
All men want that. They all want that with whores
But women hate that, they hate men
You never liked men?
I don't give a shit
That's the way I live
You can't always live that way
I can
Well, what's it to me? At least you're genuine
Looking for someone?
No, thanks
How did you find this place?
Everyone knows it
Men do. But women?
Depends which ones
How can they manage?
All those costumes!
And they take them off with such ease..
You think I'm silly, like all women
I don't know you
You probably don't get to talk much
True. Dad says I'm introverted. I don't speak for hours
There are no trains at night It's a local line
I often hear the last train, but not the first
When I sleep poorly, I rise late
In Arles I lived by the station
I love trains, like a kid
You're still a kid in many ways
Lots of trains went through Arles
Shall we sit or stand?
You'd rather lie down!
It's not that time I have to get my gear
I have to go too
Won't you join us for lunch? Friends are coming..
Sorry, I can't I have a family lunch
It was a last minute idea
A pity, I would have loved to
I'll play you something You have a lovely voice
That's going too far
You should visit me more often. We could sing that
I can't read music
- I never studied it
- You sing wonderfully
My dad wouldn't let me. And I work in the bar
- You have some free time
- See, they want me!
I've made a spot
'Bye!
Hurry!
What are you doing?
You've got work to do!
I know
Chaponval!
Next stop, Auvers!
All aboard!
Here he is
- How are you?
- I wanted to rent a carriage
- You've got no money...
- It's not far..
Give him to me I'll carry him
Chocolate!
Here they come!
My daughter, Marguerite
My son, Paul
He got little or no care there.
The doctor at St. Remy worte me that he got.. ...no specific therapy, nor regular supervision
I can't believe he had epileptic fits
That word is used to cover up ignorance
Your brother was exhausted, overworked. He works too much Still now.
And bad food That's all it takes with over-sensitive people like him
His pulse is good, as are his circulation blood pressure, and arteries
He's tough and in good shape
But any over-excitement becomes an attack...
I'd say of hysteria
It's not confined to women
He is too concentrated, monomaniacal...
The seating layout!
It's on the sideboard
You crazy?
It was harmless...
Well, lovebirds?
She connived to serve here today
Keeps tabs on you
You painted the pest?
Yes, why?
She's cute, but a bit vulgar
She's an innkeeper's daughter Not your class
You're mean!
It's the champagne
To little Vincent!
I like him very much
And to the complete recovery of big Vincent
Vincent the great
- Let's be serious...
- Homeopathy's not a serious topic
Homeopathy has one great virtue
It put an end to the barbaric practice of draining
That sounds good. But I read and unconvincing homeopathic treatise It listed 350 types of headaches
I only know of one There's a remedy for the fear of being cuckolded! - Charlatanism!
- A very widespread fear!
Come on, that doesn't exist
In allopathy, we did little to cure patients
I soon realized and I wasn't alone that we hadn't learned enough to heal... - ... the sick - Has that changed?
I've changed
The are of 1870 did it
I saw real suffering
Not just the usual hypochondriacs
Men who'd been butchered
We had to do something
We couldn't handle these men in real pain.. ...with the usual phony palliatives
Someone in pain is alone
Good intentions won't help
Sorry, madame, we're boring you...
Not at all. I'm never bored with painters
Painters?
I'm not much of one...
Theo must become a painter. I insist. We're all talented...
Why else did I marry him?
He'll paint. We got our talent from Mother
We shouldn't have become art dearlers
You're right, but for yourself For a somple man like me...
Not so simple, Mr. Van Gogh
You've carved a name in the art market, almost cornered it
There's Durand-Ruel
- You have more taste and courage - But less money
- You sponsor Impressionists..
- Except his brother
You've championed Monet and Renoir - Others will follow
- I can't wait!
Right, Theo?
Enough laces. OK?
Not too tight?
Not too tight...
Wait..
One, two..
"My name's Toulouse-Lautrec, I'm a handsome wreck,
"I get my inspiration, In places of damnation
"Although I'm short of leg, all the ladies beg
"So hide your wives from the meanie
"They all want to taste my wienie!"
In front of my kids!
I'm choking!
Once more?
Shall I do a number?
"After he entered a monastery...
"... the King of Beggars..
"It's not really Quasimodo, but it's quasi him!"
Dad, do the camel!
"The little mountain dwarfs...
"Do all the dirty work, while the shepherds sleep...
"from the witch they save the sheep... "
The Auvers ballet
I'd have liked a poem
There are lovely ones
I don't know any
Then a song. Jo, sing us "Cherryblossom Time"
Everyone knows that song!
Don't insist, Theo
- You, Madame
- I don't dare Please do
You can't turn us down.. A little song
I'll need the first note
We'll accompany you
"When we'll sing of cherryblossom time...
"all the nightingales and blackbirds
"will come out to rejoice...
"Lasses will have ribbons in their hair..
"and lovers unshine in their hearts
"When we'll sing of cherryblossom time..
"But who of us can match the blackbird's song?"
What about my poem?
I don't know any
It can't be
Is that true, doctor?
No, she just won't recite one... Search your memory
I can't remember any
Let's go for a walk by the river
Why not..
But the train's at 5:50
You've time
It'll do us good
You'll see, it's a lovely spot
That's why so many painters come
Jo has a fine face My brother's lucky
So paint her
She scares me
Meet my fiancee.
She's fallen for him
Idle girls fall easily
If Vincent was a chic painter Gachet would...
Let's get back to homeopathy
It's all contradictions You can interpret it any way you want
Like your brother's fine works
People reject them today.. .. as an outrageous, clumsy mess Soon those same "learned" people..
.. will claim they're sublime But they are now!
I hope you're right
Sorry... Shall we dance?
He's so clumsy
You wonder if he really does those things
His many weaknesses add up to strength
So do ours How can you stand him?
You don't dance?
My father disapproves. I practice secretly
Don't kiss a girl's hand!
He's a bumpkin
We sorely missed you for lunch
Still want me to sing?
A friend, Mrs. de Marigny
You've been hiding her?
I don't recruit for anyone!
I didn't mean that...
Are you a lady killer?
As with Lakme?
Good idea
Sing Lakme. The pianist will accompany you
Our friend has a lovely voice Accompany her?
Absolutely
That was wonderful
Remarkable voice
It's hard to find a woman at least for me
For everyone You're a wild man
I'm shy especially with women
Meaning?
I don't dare But I can also be bold
Really?
You never paint water?
No, I don't like to
It's too fluid the reflections are tricky
It's one thing, then another...
Cezanne can't paint the sea
It looks like cardboard, but people dote on it
In a short time, the gentlest of men has become..
.. irritable and bitter
There are constant fights Within a year...
Sorry to tell you... My husband isn't the Theo I once knew
He's more like you They way he says you are
You don't love him?
Are you mad?
I love him more than ever
To see him like this...
He tries to be cynical.. He forces himself..
He's sick, that must be it
Something's going on.
But he won't tell me He always was fragile. But, unlike me, never complains
I can feel it...
He's still considerate, but...
You'd better..
I feel like a stranger
He rejects me
As for our child.. He's worried by the tiniest bruise... But he's also distant
At times wholly absent
What's wrong?
Is it another woman?
Not his style
Don't say that
He told me of your sprees, the three of you
Ages ago!
I was forewarned
All that's past Theo's faithful as can be
I'm sure of it
You don't see him that much
One's faithful or not
I don't agree
But he feeds the whole family!
You, the baby, our mother one sister, and me. That's a lot of worries
Not you, Vincent.
You work If you say so..
I do
But he's wearing himself out. I tell you, it can't go on
Things must change Listen to me
I don't want my brother's death on my conscience
He can't die for my smudges that'll never be worth a cent
No, I say that things will change
I must do something. Theo, you and the baby can't go on this way
What can you do?
What's he doing?
Don't worry
He did it on the ferry with Mom
- Can he swim?
- He did it through our youth
There..
Pretty good
He'd really upset Mom
Come along... You'll catch cold..
How smart of you!
Very clever!
I'll get in first
My hat
We spent a nice day, right kids?
Come back, I'll paint the baby
You'll be a monster
Come visit
- Come to Paris soon
- On a Sunday
- Where is he?
- Gone. He always does that
We can't abandon him
Who said we will?
We never discuss things
Don't bother to ask!
Now I've got to go refill it!
You could say thanks
He gets on my nerves!
Now you water the wine!
- So, who taught me?
- Shut up!
You did!
Hear how she talks to me?
So much laundry!
I told my hudband we need bigger vats!
He never listens!
I'm sick of it!
That's too much..
It's musty in here
I thought it might storm
Not a breath of air
Is the baby restless?
No, he didn't get much champagne
You're being so nice. Can't you always be this way?
It won't last
You haven't had a real talk with your brother for a year
All last year..
Never
You were around
Yes, I was
But I was selfish
I thought only of us
That's all I ever do
When Vincent starts to paint, I sell other painters.
That's what destroys him
You can't deny it ...his life's a disater
You're part of it
Your life's a disaster, too
You don't love me?
Of course I do
If you don't udnerstand that...
I can't explain
You sling a lot of mud at me Why?
I don't know
Let go of me
Some water?
It's cool
Can I take it?
How will you paint?
Wait!
The milk's boiling...
You leaving?
I've got things to do. Be back later
You won't eat with us?
I lost
Six and one, seven Almost eight
There..
No, a nine
A nine would be nice Fice and four is nine!
Your turn
Call it
- What number? - One!
Will you draw the sand-merchant for him?
Mr. Van Gogh will draw you the sand-merchant
Come beside me
Go on
Well?
It's nice
Thanks, Mr. Van Gogh
Look!
See the nice sand-merchant?
You're not kind
- What's it for?
- What?
Kiindness
To get on witih people...
To live happily, have friends
Some more?
Bread and butter?
I never eat in the morning
I was looking at this...
She's like my mom in her youth, You did it?
No, Gilbert did
That's not like your other work More like paper for books
Mom used to say one loves only one person in life
It's true. Mom loved Dad, Dad only loved her, Coco loves Dad.
- And you?
- I don't know yet
And you?
You love no one
Strange, my fire's lit
Who lit it?
Did you?
So do it everyday, and bring me breakfast
I'm not Gilbert!
Don't joke.
He had a fever last night
How do you know?
Snopping again?
I never get to see you
I should've brought my embroidery
Garlic sausage. What a treat!
Want some?
I needed a pick-me-up
I enjoy a rest.
Mountain guides eat slowly, in silence
You don't need a rest You haven't started work
I'm all done
So paint me...
I Dad knew, he'd kill me
Him? No chance
You think everything's funny
No, I don't
You've got strength
Who, me?
A real strongman
Your arms aren't very muscular A woman's shouldn't be
Well, a little shape...
Only Dad exercises in our family
Glass of wine?
C'mon Coming?
Good wine from my brother's vineyard
We'll soon see If we don't drink too much!
It's nice here
You want another?
Seen my daugher?
Ah, doctor..
I see it's real party...
Sort of..
Can I have a shot?
Well, 'bye
- Can't I come to Paris?
- I was waiting...
I'm left at home alone like a little kid
And me at Ravoux's staring at a great wall?
So why live there?
"Week" takes two e's
There's also "w-e-a-k"... That's what I am with you two
This is "w-e-e-k"
What's got into him?
Think he doesn't know?
You were gone all day. It's not done!
Look at you!
You'll get pregnant
How would you know?
I had a baby boy at your age
Really?
You never told us
He joined the Commune in 1870 We never saw him again
When it was over.. .. the army moved into Paris He didn't come home
They summoned me
I was his body laid out with the others.
He was 15
Poor you
That's all past
No, nothing's ever past
It's past...
But Van Gogh may not be a reliable man
I was behind you. Where'd you go?
I had me a drink
King size. Overdoing it again!
Damn fairy!
You could help me
Your folks out?
Dunno where they are
It's paid
I owed you for one
Go right ahead!
Want my wife too? No.
Your daughter maybe. But she helps herself, like us
- You're some guard keeper!
- What?
The train nearly ran a man over Ran a man over?
In 20 years I never saw it happen
Hello, maestro
Could I?
I wanted a peek... if you don't mind
It's in the back
One more, and I'll be there
What changes since you left Paris!
Such a daring approach to pointillism!
It's exquisite
My paintings are there
I'm relieved I was being hypocritical
As if I told you that thing was the future of art
But with that.. I can be sincere
If I could do that
Look!
Your St. Remy self-portrait
You often finish paintings in the studio?
Happens... Bits and pieces..
That's my garden and Marguerite...
Coco's favorite acacia...
That's good too
Hello.
Are you better?
The oozing stopped?
Two portraits of me!
I'm honored I always do a copy
Which do I prefer?
You'll only get one.
What a treat!
My models always get the copy
Really?
Teach me your cut-reed technique
It's ismple you just cut a reed
Theo doesn't push your work Dear Theo is being retentive
I know
You laugh, but it shatters me I told him to see you
Is he ill?
I meant your career. It's coming along.
Aurier's piece was fine
He's an idiot
Very literary.
Writers don't understand painting
My daughter said you were worried...
That stinging pain?
Please, I'm her father
I'm here to help you
No, to cure me
You're in fine health, but a hypochondriac
At St. Remy you thrived on your illness
I'm no expert But my fits weren't imaginary
You doctors aren't patients When you are, then what?
We cease to be doctors You should be on a diet
I'll wrap it up
I'll parade with your masterpiece You're muscular, like me
Exercise!
I don't laze in my studio
My legs go in my art, too
Your painting hasn't found its price, only its pace!
What the hell are you doing?
That pink haze there upsets the balance I'm removing it It's a big mistake
That's much better
I like fluid airy things like Turner
I soar above this earthbound art
Earthbound
Those mechanical strokes
Your paintings are too big!
Too big?
How come you copied them 5 times?
Mine are ecstasy... fluidity...
Look what you do?
It's so thick the leaves are like the water or the sky. It's all the same
There's no glaze You don't know how to glaze
All those layers all those strokes
It's all bunched up
There's no feeling...
You through?
Look at that...
You through?
I saw his paintings.. Superb!
I'm proud, he's like family
He always will be
We have 6 rooms and you won't take him in.
His room isn't a room
- You've seen it?
- No, but I can imagine
You'd like him sleeping nearer to you
The insane can be dangerous company
What do you mean?
I mean in general
You said he's normal, in good health. Make up your mind!
He cut his own ear. The fits at the asylum in St. Remy...
Lock me up and I'd have fits too.
His brother never visited him
His real trouble is the syphilis he's had for years
Mom had it too, She died of it. You have it to her
Don't talk like that!
Not in that tone!
His influence again!
They said she'd go blind she was put in a dark room
Aunt Francia told me I was sent away to Lille
Your mother was always in poor health. What is this?
I read bits of your medical books.
You hid things from us
I was young, kids notice things. Unhappiness affects them
What's got into you?
You're hysterical, like your mother
To you Vincent's hysterical we all are. It's fashionable
You aspire toliberal thinking but you wind up a bigot You can't cure him.
You do nothing!
He came to be cured!
It's as wrong to say he's mad, as to say he's not
I'm in love with him! - What?
- I'm in love with him!
You'd marry that...
Who said marriage?
You'd live with a madman... No madder than you.
He loves me, wants to live with me
- He told you? - No, but I know it
So much for your liberalism!
You apply it to others, but not me
You're like everyone else
I have no set ideas, but this...
In theory, you're considerate, modern... free love and all that...
But in practice, forget it.
You're a coward
That's why you can't paint!
What you just said is unforgivable
Good news, I convinced Theo
Jo and the baby will spend the summer here
Glad?
It's unfair to slave and earn no money from one's work
You earn something from your work
You're going to support me?
I know Theo won't help me any more
Some days painting revolts me Maybe it's just as well
I write Theo that all's find He doesn't realize what I'm doing
Maybe he does. What can he tell?
That it's no good? He can't
- You always defend him!
- I try to understand
I know what's up
Don't talk about things you don't know
The Van Goghs aren't an artistic family
The way my father looked at me My work had to be really ugly and dirty to him for me to get that look
I just went on painting in my own way. That's all
I Keep at it..
But what's the use
True, things are chaning.
You help me more than Kate... Thanks alot!
Maybe if I'd met you instead of her...
You're lucky she didn't work out People say her rejection of you drove you to paint great art
I say, with a decent girl you'd have done even better work
If that's what you think
Yes, I do
Stop complaining!
you're gifted!
Forget your brother and his wife Forget all that
Only you can make the name Van Gogh famous!
Are we married?
You sound like my wife
Look, they're not pushing you you're towing them all
They're jealous of what you've got
Nothing was good enough for your Kate
Those women always marry the idiots they deserve!
And you're moping over her
Why are you going to Paris Sunday?
- To get sloshed
- You can't do that here?
To get sloshed!
Notice anything?
I konow them by heart
We're out of the woods.
Theo will soon smother you with jewels
I'll sell for less
There's only 30 And the rest?
At Tanguy's
I'll go to Clauzel Street
Watch out if you run into people. You scare everyone
He picks fights in Paris
He's a grown man
He's eccentric... But like anyone else.. ...he need help..
We can't do anything except relieve our own guilt
Like charity, that makes the donors feel good
Those 50 franc bills...
They relieve you more than him
Am I right?
- Get rid of this for me - What?
- There
- I hate that..
Go on, squeeze
That's it
He should've been one of the best painters of his time
But he started late and rushed things
He always does like when he wanted to be a priest
He never learned
I don't understand him
The truth is ...deep down I don't like his painting
I wish he painted like Renoir
I'd love that
No, I don't want him to paint like Renoir
Not that, either. But if Renoir painted like Vincent I'd like it because my brother hadn't done it.
See? What nonsense
You complicate everything
Life just happens, that's all
Shall I rinse you down?
Vollard's wrong to play the crafty dealer
Clever people act dumb
No, people prefer to deal with the craftiest
Come here...
Look at these marvels
Very nice
Beautiful
That painting grows on me
All those shades of blue
As perfect as a Tiepolo
He painted it when the baby was born
It's there so I can see it from my bed when I wake up
Here's to both Vincents
In a Japanese mode like the painting!
Rene is so talented
I know
That awful sun, the green sky..
Who are those creeps?
- They help sell you!
- I doubt it
Remove my paintings from Tanguy's It's a pigsty.
They'll rot!
- Where do I put them?
- Under your bed! - Or can't the maid sweep?
- Jo sweeps!
If Saint Jo does it...
Why are they in there?
I don't know
I'm a pain, right?
No, Vincent
Theo's not well
Dr. Gachet's not good enough for him
How will it all end?
You're the only one I feel close to
One must be selfish
Theo doesn't know how to be
That's what I am, selfish
I can't whistle
Pity you made two holes in the painting
You touched my wife?
And you're so out of touch
You don't paint ones like her You like sluts!
And you?
See you soon. We'll settle in all..
Thanks for coming
You're awful You quarrel with everyone
Even Gachet. You fought with him
You're rude to Aurier
You know ciritics like Aurier sell art
Buyers are more influenced by.. what they read than what they see
You know it
Yes, they read a alot of gibberish about beauty and have their minds all set
Critics praise good and bad so buters lap it all up
It's called eclecticism
Shit!
You got it made!
And you neglect the best painter of our time! You're the best?
Yes, I am.
You sleep on my work. It's under your bed
- Where do I put it? - Show it!
You wrote me not to!
All my work!
You got it for nothing!
How can you say that?
You're awful
One day I'll stop supporting you
You're just a dealer who exploits artists, a slave driver
You buy cheap, anyway From me you get.. 20 works a month for the price of one second-rate impressionist
You're vile
You must be revolted by your own words!
You've ruined our relationship Good.
I'm not scared
I'll be better off I've been sponging
All those paintings are yours Forever!
Fine words! "Forever!" If I died, who'd get my paintings?
Who?
You might destroy them like Mother did at home!
No one in the family believe in me.
No one! "Get rid of these" She said
She didn't Who told you that?
I happen to know it
I was a coward to accept your money. I became a drone
What's worse, I feel I'm being kept
The shame!
better to be a dock-worker
One can't work and paint Those who tried stopped painting
Gauguin painted for years as a stockbroker
You smothered me
I'd have worked harder, better I've done nothing great
And life's too sad
I'm at the end of my tether
Haven't you noticed?
My painting is shit
Seen my portrait of Marguerite Gachet?
Crap!
It's a transition Don't exaggerate
You've been there 2 months You can't always be on top
On top?
You've never liked what I do A kind word here and there but I know your taste
You've never spoken this way.
Never
I'm sick I can't keep this up for long
No, not for long
I've never had pains like this
Seen a doctor?
He didnt' understand me
You in pain now?
You are harder to bear We've had our problems but your present mood..
What? You're healthy and close to success! But my painting's worse!
Aurier's piece has made you And your fits
They're over!
Listen, Theo There are no fits
I never had any
There were tricks, like a squid spurts ink to hide
I'm telling you, it won't be a fit but a calm decision, if I can... to put an end to what's unbearable for me and all of us
I'm not as selfish as you say I do think of others
I didn't come to settle a score, just to say hello
Lautrec's always late
Vincent?
Come eat
Really!
Hare?
Will you stay in Auvers?
I'll leave Where?
With no money?
Who do we paint for?
Rich collectors connoisseurs... assoholes... the worst We paint for them
Dump all my stuff
You've got over 200 that's 20,000 francs
I can't unload all that by an unknown artist
Who's to blame?
Make up your mind
I'm off
Hear of Schubert?
What about him?
Yes, Schubert
Didn't you know?
All his friends dumped him.. to avoid catching his disease
What's the connection?
Don't you see?
You notice too late you have no friends.. if you can still notice things..
Just as well
You're crazy!
Stop that!
It's weakness, Vincent
When there's no more hay horses fight
I can't stand them
Find some buyers. I can't stand them. Get rid of them!
Look, I didn't do that!
Did I paint that eye?
Those shaded greys, the contour of the eyes..
I did that?
Impossible
I paint receding chins in banal complementary colors
Dump them or sell them Selling is dumping for money!
I can't
You can't?
NO one wants them, right?
What?
Nothing, Vincent
"Nothing, Vincent"
I bet if I throw them out the window..
.. they'll be there tomorrow No one'll touch them
Even garbage men and bums
Here, Mr. Van Gogh, your onion soup
You well, Vincent?
What's up?
I'm having my soup
Glad you're back in Paris
What're you up to?
Having my soup
Here's big Suzanne V
Back in Paris?
I just want to eat my soup
You know I paint now Dear Suzanne..
Everyone paints now, even women
How would he live without you?
Maybe he'd die!
He'd die!
He'd get a job like everyone else
I've known men as talented as he who wanted to live off their art
They took jobs Like everyone. Real jobs
Being an artist is a luxury
You must be able to afford it
I'm sick of hearing of their sufferings
The poor really suffer
They have no work, no food
Vincent is your showgirl!
- You can't afford him! - I've managed
It has to change
You have a family now Not just yours.
You'll support that wreck all your life?
Shut up!
Stop that!
- You're vulgar, Johanna - Yes, I am!
Stop that!
Coming!
What's happened?
He wasn't on the train He's not back.
Where is he? You must have crossed him...
He's not back.
He can only be one place
You know it. Take her there
A drink?
No, Thanks
Have you eaten?
I'm not hungry
Let's go
It'll be like the good old days
You're heavy!
You look content
You're new here I don't know you
You're married, right?
Brought your wife?
She was too tired
She had her baby?
3 months ago. He's big
Should've brought her.
She's teasing
She'd love it here!
Your name?
Cathy
Pretty name. You have nice rings, pretty hands
- How are things, Suzanne?
- All right
How's Puvis de Chavanne' Kid?
He's 7 now
Time flies
Did you wipe out Henri?
He always naps after it.
Not wearing socks?
I left in a hurry
- Your wife kicked you out?
- Sort of..
Play something more... more..
I'm busy
I came to Paris just for that
I always did you well...
Don't touch me
You crazy?
I looked for you in Auvers, left you a note
Can we meet?
Hands off!
Tomrrow... the day after.. Sure...
You can't be bothered..
Let go...
Hands off!
Your sweetness is phony
Asshole!
Go home!
Who needs you!
The whore with the heart of gold!
You're so romantic you're a goner!
She's shy
Sing "Red Hill"
"It's called Red Hill.. "... and here's why. All who fought here were doomed to die
"Now it's a vineyard like so many others...
"But when you drink its wine, you drink the blood of your brothers
"There were no pretty maids on that hill... "... no swains, no laughter and mirth
"It's far from Montmartre and Paris, the hub of the earth
"That hill is soaked in the blood... "... of farmers and workers who answered a call
"Those who start wars never die of them... "... only the innocent fall
"Red Hill.. "... is its name... "... and here's why.
All who fought here were doomed to die "Now it's a vineyard like so many others...
"But when you drink its wine, you drink the blood of your brothers
May I Here, taste
It's good Drink..
More...
You love me?
Say it
Come, brother. Time to parade! Look sharp!
- Will you buy my paintings? - I did...
Which ones?
Those I paint!
You're known as a model!
No one wants your paintings!
Bastard! Now you're like all the dealers
I need sleep before I open my gallery
I'll go snooze with my old lady
Third class is narrow
Sure, the poor have smaller asses
This is living
Tickets please
Kiss again, it's the milk-train! Have a nice trip!
What's wrong?
I so wish you loved me...
I know you don't Doesn't matter
What have I done?
Answer when I ask you!
You can't take paintings to the grave!
Painting!
It's a disease
You're sick, you hear!
You grovel in your shit! Your shitty paintings!
From your sick mind!
Let go of me!
You're not normal!
You're insane!
Stay there!
Sit down!
Here You're alone?
Where's my daugher?
- Your ugly face!
- She vanished yesterday
- What happened? - Nothing
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing
Answer
Are you ill?
There's no need to destroy to create!
You sow despair A great artist but a loathsome man
You're twice her age!
Aren't you ashamed?
I've known many painters They weren't like you
You're vulgar It's in everything you do
You don't love me You don't care
If you knew how I love you...
You forgot your package
Go out onto the platform The young lady's unwell
- Get help! - A doctor?
I'm a doctor, idiot!
A carriage
Take her feet... Climb up and lift her..
- What are you eating?
- A bun Can I have some?
Good, huh?
Here, take that
Come on..
- Where you off to?
- To watch him paint
Matching loonies! Why's that here?
Do other hotels let'em paint indoors?
Soon it'll be in the bar!
It won't be a bar but a paint store!
You didn't do my ear
Move over
Some day we'll do this for free Normally...
Right, it'll be nice
Let's start now What?
For free
Really?
That send you?
When I kiss your neck
Well it does me. So do it.
Are you eating me?
Where's La Mouche?
In Paris
Hurry, I'm bushed
It'll be all right
Don't you want any?
She doesn't
Why not?
What's wrong?
Glass of wine?
Who was that?
Mr. Van Gogh.
Why isn't he eating with us?
Go look.
See what he's up to
Coming?
Go see what's up
Wants none
Just like your sister
Mom, come quick!
What is it?
- Suicide's great for a hotel!
- Some hotel! Three rooms!
Is it a bullet?
Yes, it is
Does that hurt?
Help me turn him over
You in pain? Want a shot? No shots
Shall we operate?
Well, doctor?
He needs hot compresses And clean his bed
Very well, doctor
An overdose of barbiturates is easier to deal with
When your daughter said it was suicide... I brought my stomach pump
We'll look after you
Doctor, where were you?
- I was away, Where is he? - Upstairs
- May I?
- Go ahead
- Sorry... - The casualty's next door
You won't let me examine you?
Well, doctor?
He's breathing normally As if he wasn't hurt
I'll open the door
They're doing nothing?
Don't say that
But they aren't!
Little one...
Dear Theo...
You shouldn't have come... till I'd croaked
Is that position all right?
He chose it. Leave him in it
No, don't...
It's good for him
Isn't drinking bad for him?
Don't give him a thing
They've readied a room for you Get some rest. I'll watch him
How is he?
Get me a brandy
He must be moved to a hospital in Paris. And operated on.
Never...
He can't be moved
It'd kill him
But he'll die if he lingers here
We can't do nothing and let him die
He'll die of nothing!
If he's still alive after 12 hours his organs must be intact
Even a surgeon would damage his organs extracting the bullet
The journey alone may kill him
I agree with my colleague...
I think it's hopeless
All right?
I'm hungry
It's all over
I'll settle up
Board and lodging for June is due.
And Dr. Masery's two visits
Did he give you any paintings?
Two
Keep them. They're yours
Run along. Don't tell your sister
I'll return the paintings he left with me
My portrait and my daugher's
We were just storing them...
You must keep them. He'll become known through your collection
If you mean it... I'm very touched.
Mr. Van Gogh, I've done the death certificate
My foot!
I didn't mean to!
My foot's crushed and you laught!
I'm not laughing
Doctor!
My foot!
I'll massage you
I have a healing hand
Better? Feels good
So good...
I never let anyone touch my feet
That's much better I'll help you
It'll take months to heal
You from here?
This the hanged man's house?
No, it's on Pylon Street No one hanged himself there
First time you've painted here?
No, I come often
It's like all the greats are still here
Pissarro, Cezanne Daumier, Millet...
Millet never came Daumier lived in Valmondois
He painted a studio door here
The owner will show it to you
What's the motif?
Don Quixote... Van Gogh liked it a lot
You knew Van Gogh?
Yes. He was my friend.
On February 8, 1807... from daybreak to nightfall... the battle of Eylau cost Napoleon's France 10,000 dead.
His Majesty King Louis XVIII...
His (capital H) Majesty (capital M)...
Louis (capital L) XVIII... took...no, reconquered, make that reconquered... reconquered His kingdom...
If only he understood!
You are in the office of Mr. Derville, attorney at law!
It's burning, Hure!
Open the window!
Mr. Hure, you rascal!
No more snacks for you!
Stop all this chatter!
I asked for a cloth to shield my hands.
Why not gloves?
Calfskin?
Pigskin?
The scarecrow, with his hat screwed on!
He's coming!
Shut the window! And your trap too!
But, sir...
Quiet, Mr. Simonnin!
Don't keep the others from working.
We base our case... on the decree... Issued June 17, 1816.
Can I see your employer today?
Mr. Derville is in court, sir.
Good evening, sir. As you can see, it's dinnertime. We're closing.
- When will Mr. Derville be back?
With Mr. Derville, you never know. He's very busy.
State your case quickly, and we can...
I need a long time to explain my case. And I'll explain it to no one but Mr. Derville.
I've come here five times!
Sorry, sir, but there's the possible and the impossible.
It's impossible to talk to Mr. Derville if he's not here. And Mr. Derville is not here.
He's busy until past midnight.
If you're strong enough to return at 1:00 am...
Tonight at 1:00 am?
You got rid of him.
You have to take spectres like him by surprise.
Quite a surprise, a 1:00 am appointment. I say he's an old servant cheated of his pay.
A coachman, I'll bet. Nagged by his wife and despoiled by his children!
- It's a bet!
- Why a coachman?
By the odor, sir.
- Didn't you notice?
- Perhaps.
A horsey smell, and then some! Stronger than horse.
A coachman's stink!
But the bet's on! Simonnin!
Now what are you up to?
Sir? We need your name for the appointment! Chabert.
Colonel Chabert.
See, he's a colonel!
The one who died at Eylau?
Godeschal, really!
Don't make tasteless jokes.
But I feel concerned. I handled the Chabert estate... for Attorney Roguin, three or four years ago.
So he's a ghost?
He's neither ghost nor Colonel Chabert. He's just mad.
Godeschal's right. He's crazy.
- Godeschal lost his bet.
- What do you mean?
A colonel's a horseman. More coachman than servant.
Madam, the guests are here. The Count says the concert's starting.
I'm coming.
Help me, Sophie.
Brady Worms? You remembered?
I was in London and I thought...
He'll make a fine peer!
I haven't smoked one of these since I left England.
You remembered the weakness I confessed to you?
A trifle, sir!
Life in England is unrivaled, but after a year the London moneylenders sucked our blood.
Emigration...how sad!
We were so short of funds.
How those people made us suffer!
- Yet we do our best to imitate them.
This Chamber of Peers you're so proud of... imitates their House of Lords.
Same standards of birth and wealth. It too is the way to government service...to power!
You'll be neither lord nor senator, my dear sir... but a Peer of France.
May I take two?
The box is for you, my lord.
He's bribing me!
I already mention him to anyone who has the King's ear.
Why waste your money?
The Peerage... There'll be no trouble slipping you in.
You're highly esteemed... everywhere. Esteemed... but...
I'm already setting up an entailment.
Who mentioned entailment?
We know your fortune could buy... ten peerages.
My fortune is often confused with that of my wife.
Countess Ferraud is irreproachable. A good wife and mother.
I owe her a lot.
It's nothing to do with her personally.
We know how attached you are to each other.
It's what she represents.
The principle she represents, her past.
Her fortune amassed under Napoleon.
You know our friends... suffered under that tyrant... While that lovely woman partied... danced with marshals he promoted... who bowed to their Little Corporal.
His Majesty resents all that.
It'll be forgotten. Everything is. But we must act now.
In six months the chamber will be full.
Baron Courcelle has three daughters to marry off... and one foot in the grave.
It's time to go calling with gifts of sweets.
Don't miss the boat, Ferraud. Make your move.
When powerful interests vie, you can't put one on ice... and serve the other.
You have to cut.
It should be surgical.
Surgical. An excision.
Look at Talleyrand.
His wife was an idiot. Goodbye, Madam.
Look at the monster Bonaparte.
Josephine was sterile.
Out with her.
It seems a huge step. The first six weeks are difficult. Then one morning you wake up... and realize it's passed.
Like an illness.
I must see to my other guests.
Excuse me.
Of course, my dear man.
But...think over our chat.
Ambition... or the pillow?
It's up to you.
All this music is a bore.
It was a great success.
Indeed.
You seem doubtful. A great success.
The wine was scalding. Too hot. For my taste, anyway.
Lucienne served it too soon.
I warned her, but she's unruly.
I'll speak to her.
The musicians cost a lot of money.
I'll put them away, Sophie.
- Yes, Madam.
- You go to bed.
Goodnight, Madam.
They were good, and we agreed to the price.
The musicians.
How do you know they were good?
I hired them for your pleasure... and you vanished with that old miser Chamblin.
Vanished?
I was in the next room. Music can be heard from room to room.
So can Chamblin.
He annoyed everyone.
Was what you had to say... so important?
So secret?
The peerage as usual, I suppose?
The peerage... and many other things.
What, for example?
What other things?
Sophie is really a nitwit!
I ought to get her back down here.
She forgot to remove my necklace.
Don't disturb her.
Well?
Aside from the peerage... what did you gentlemen talk about?
The weather... Hunting.
And me?
You spoke about me?
Yes.
You. Me. The Empire.
Surgery.
You forgot your keys, boss?
Oh, it's you.
You said 1:00 am.
I know, but...
This way.
The porter let you come in?
I mentioned Derville.
Sit down.
Attorney Derville will be back soon.
I'll be patient.
Did you think we were joking... when we stipulated this amazing time... to see Mr. Derville?
This is his normal routine.
Each evening he's out cultivating people.
From 10:00 am to 2:00 pm he sees clients. The rest of the day he's in court or at meetings.
He has only the night to plan his case strategies.
He's immensely intelligent.
He can do ten things at once.
He'll sit there, dining, reading letters and newspapers... while I outline the next day's cases.
Never gets mixed up!
Everything is absorbed, analyzed, filed.
He makes it a point of honor never to lose a case.
Any case!
Sir, whom have I the honor of speaking to?
Colonel Chabert.
I'm listening.
I wish no one but you to know my situation.
You may go, Boucard.
- But... - No.
Sleep well.
Yes, sir. It's all ready...
All right, I'll tend to it. Good night.
I'm all yours, sir.
Don't mind if I read. I'm listening carefully.
Late at night every minute counts.
Please be precise and brief.
Get right to the point.
If questions are needed, I'll ask them.
All right. I'm Chabert.
Colonel.
I commanded a calvary regiment at Eylau... where I died on February 8, 1807.
I was a key figure in Murat's charge... that won the battle.
I can even say I saved the day.
I crossed the Russian lines.
Three lines reformed behind me as we rejoined the Emperor... after massacring the Russians.
Two officers... giants...attacked me. A saber gashed open my head.
I fell off my horse.
You fell off your horse.
Murat flew to my aid... and 2000 riders passed over my body...no less!
The earth shook. I felt it in my gut. 2000!
A charge no one will ever see again.
The cannons... the screams...
The battle shook my body... until I died.
It's all in "French Victories and Conquests from 1792 to 1815".
It must be in your library.
The Emperor was told of my death.
He said, as you'll see on page 206:
"So my poor Chabert is dead!"
The Emperor!
Two surgeons, who didn't bother to listen to my heart, signed the death certificate.
And there I was...a corpse!
Did you know I'm Countess Ferraud's lawyer?
Yes, I know.
I came to you because all the other lawyers think I'm mad.
But yes, I know.
You interrupted.
Page 206, "Victories and Conquests".
"So my poor Chabert is dead.
Two surgeons. And there I was, a corpse!"
My wounds had put me in a cataleptic state.
That's why I was inert... when, as usual in wartime... the burial detail stripped me... and threw me naked into the mass grave.
The pit...
How was I to breathe?
No air.
My ears rang. And my head...
There's no word to describe the pain.
But I can describe death.
Death is red, then blue. And it is cold.
Above all... It's silent.
Silent...
At first, you seem to hear a running brook:
My comrades' dying breath and moans.
Some weep, oh, yes.
Bones crack...
Teeth grind... Oh, Lord!
And then...
And then... the slightest sigh echoes... echoes...
And then...
Death is the silence of death.
Then suddenly... a thump. Another and then another.
My heart began to beat again.
I moved the mass smothering me... opening a breach big as a rabbit hole.
Air flowed down on me. Air!
The cold burned me like salt. To suffer is, after all, to live.
A woman saw the snow flutter when I coughed.
She called her husband... a fool who knelt and crossed himself.
She hauled me out of the pit to their hut.
Six months between life and death.
They took me to the Heilsberg hospital.
My memory returned in bits and pieces.
My name, my past life... my colonel's rank.
Luckily...
Dr. Sparchmann, a surgeon... took an interest in my case.
Sparchmann, Heinrich...
Neukapelle Strasse, Heilsberg.
He took me to his lawyer, a Prussian, like him.
So I got my story on paper, with oaths and signatures... medical descriptions of my wounds... testimony from my rescuers. It's all there, in Heilsberg.
I was to get a copy, but war resumed. I had to flee. A city each week.
Those people are no worse than others.
No better, either.
I was French, an enemy, but they fed me.
When they heard "Colonel"... they laughed.
Often it got me a kick in the ass.
Or the madhouse.
The madhouse... the worst thing that can happen to a man.
The buckets of water... your arms tied behind your back... the cudgel... the food they toss you.
And as a madman... you live with the mad.
Cottbus...
Dresden...
Gera.
The asylum in Gera!
After all that, I can't stand my name.
Yet I'm claiming it.
I'd like not to be me...
Yet here I am.
The general blindness mystifies me.
Knock at any attorney's door...
In rags, sir... a knock brings dogs and policemen!
How does one bring a lawsuit... without cash on the table?
You should know that.
A lawsuit against whom?
The Russian Army?
Against my wife!
You mentioned her name before.
Isn't Countess Ferraud my wife?
She has a large fortune.
It came from me. From me...alone.
I found her here, in Paris.
I call. She has me thrown out.
I write to her.
Boutin, my only friend... my orderly in my days of glory.
Boutin... who alone recognized me in a Strasbourg jail... from which we escaped together.
You wrote to Countess Ferraud?
Four times from Prussia, twice since my return.
I'd say, maybe they were lost in the mail.
Boutin handed her the last one.
She tore it up without reading it.
Without reading it.
She's killing me again!
Killing me!
Calm yourself.
I earned it for her... I bought her a house.
It cost me over 100,000 francs. With paintings... furnishings, everything!
Maybe at first she didn't recognize my deathly pallor.
But since then?
I was buried under the dead, sir.
Now they're burying me under the living...
Under papers, stamps...
Lawyers see worse things than writers can invent.
I've seen wills burned...
Mothers despoil their lawful children... on behalf of those bred in adultery. Wives use their husbands' love to murder them... or drive them mad, so as to live with their lovers.
I've seen ugly quarrels over still-warm bodies.
I've seen crimes, sir... Crimes... that human justice is powerless to punish.
Our offices are sewers that no one can clean.
Tonight I won 300 francs at cards.
I'll contribute half to your resurrection.
Tomorrow see my chief clerk, Boucard.
Tell him your story, with dates, names, addresses.
Add any details you think of overnight.
As for me... I have five more hours' work to do.
Forgive me. Shall I see you out?
Are those all people you're defending?
The files?
I attack people too.
It reminds me of the Genoa cemetary.
Graves on the hillside... dangling red flowers.
The Genoa cemetary...
Is my wife there?
This way.
- You know her?
- Of course.
Has she changed?
Changed?
I wouldn't know, sir.
But today, as a woman, Countess Ferraud is...
The word will come to me:
"Superb".
Superb.
That's her, all right.
- You'll recover your wealth, Colonel. - "Colonel"!
But the paperwork, the mail... It all takes time.
Here's an advance.
Until you win, you'll get a stipend so you can live decently.
It's a difficult case. Even if I get the papers you say are in Heilsberg... It's no certainty.
It will be slow. It goes before three courts.
Leave Countess Ferraud alone.
You still love her?
Love her?
No.
Yes.
I want her, that's for sure. But such disgust too!
Forget her as a woman. From now on she's merely... the opposing party, the enemy.
- Very well.
- We'll play dead.
No one can do that better than I, sir.
Even if I lose my money... I won't regret it.
I'll have seen the most skilled actor of our time.
Third wound in the back:
Austerlitz. Nine inches, from navel to left breast:
Iena.
Fourth wound...
- He contradicts himself?
Not once in three weeks. Not one mistake.
Ask about yesterday's weather, he's mute. But a wound 15 year ago? He's ruler-precise.
I'm waiting for his papers.
It'll be a long wait.
Does Sprachmann even exist?
Or the Heilsberg lawyer?
Or even his accomplice, Boutin?
- Meaning?
- It's memorized, like a role.
He's been repeating it for ten years, revising, ruminating.
- And his birthplace? - He's a foundling.
There must be some record.
- And his mother's name?
- Unknown.
He gives her name as Augustine or Augusta. Sometimes Marguerite.
That's how it is!
Memory's like that!
Mine, at any rate!
It's all dead!
Except some spots glow like embers... and they can die too.
You'd understand if you saw the wound on my head.
That wound...his head... - You saw it?
- No, that's like a shrine.
His hat's nailed over it.
When he took it off to mop his neck, he had a black stocking cap under it.
Move, Simonnin!
The same one he wore under his helmet.
- And the inventory, Godeschal?
- Nothing new. None of the valuables he describes appear in the estate inventory.
- Really?
- Yes. Ask Desroches.
No tapestries, no silver punch bowl.
The Girodet painting?
No trace of it, or of the display cabinet... for the coin collection he boasted of.
I keep telling you: A pretty cabinet, with eight flat drawers... velvet-lined, with holes for the antique coins.
Silver, bronze, all rarities.
12 of them: Greek, Roman, some even older.
Spoils of war. Wiesbach Palace.
I repeat sir, the estate lists no such...
Your millions come down to a few hundred thousand... perhaps less.
I keep on reciting...
I made a list of my goods before I went off to war.
I have your list.
But compared with the one your wife gave to Rougin...
The official estate inventory after your...death...
My death!
They don't match.
It's terrifying.
It's magnificent.
Your wife robbed you like a bandit, which you can forgive. But she also robbed the State, which never forgives.
We have a good way to bring her to her knees. You don't matter. It's a case of tax fraud.
If she contests it, we'll call witnesses.
- What witnesses?
- Boutin, for one. He knew you in your days of glory.
He saw the painting, the punch bowl, perhaps even the money...
Boutin saw it all. He even got a bit of it.
But I won't bring him into court.
Really?
He's wanted. A Strasbourg lawman.
- No.
- Yes.
They threatened me with the madhouse.
All right, no Boutin.
We'll canvas your fellow soldiers.
Fishing's poor in that stream. Too many dead.
Too many dead.
Russia devoured them all.
All switch... Right attacks left!
Bounce on those thighs!
Torso springs straight on the thighs!
You're on horseback, gentlemen.
Don't forget that!
Straighten your backs!
You asshole!
Fined for obscenity!
- He broke my nose.
- Good for him!
In combat, it'd be your skull!
Son of a bitch!
Stop the fighting!
Sergeant, the rules!
No swearing, no blasphemy. No insults.
No talk of the Bourbons or their cronies!
We honor the Emperor and await his son.
Violators will be fined.
He buys two quarts!
Crépin, gather the rods.
The rest can take a break.
In silence!
Who's this clown?
Mr. Derville.
In formation, gentlemen!
Combat positions!
Attack!
The papers, Colonel.
The papers from Germany.
- Hello, Colonel.
- Hello, sir.
How'd you find me?
We had you followed.
Is there someplace quiet we can talk?
Of course.
You live here?
I wanted to hide this poverty from you.
What a stench!
The bears sleep there.
- Are they yours?
- Boutin's.
They dance, coins drop, so we eat.
Speaking of which, I'm embarrassed, but...
You want to talk about money too?
Frankly, yes. We met two months ago.
You get five francs a day.
- Isn't Boucard paying you?
- Yes. Yes, in cash every Friday.
He makes me sign a receipt.
Well, then?
That's Boutin, my orderly.
Is there no better lodging in Paris?
The stink is awful!
A place suiting your rank of Colonel... Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor?
No tailors, wig makers, cobblers?
You think I'm wasting my money?
So people can say, "Chabert spends it... on wine, gambling, women"?
- I only mean...
- When I'm rich, you'll get double. Tenfold, a hundredfold!
It's too sloppy, Sergeant!
Landrevec, you look ridiculous! Guard your thigh and head!
Saber combat is a science.
For the calvary, the science of survival. Survival is a soldier's duty.
"Reports of the Imperial Army."
I know them by heart up to the battle of Eylau. Up to my death. Then they went it alone.
"By heart." You admit that openly?
Why not?
You can say it to me... but suppose...
Come, we'll be better off outside.
Suppose... our opponent heard that naive admission.
They'd say, "The imposter memorized it all!" That stink of bear!
- The wind blows it back.
Don't worry. They're chained.
Brie's the youngest. I gave him to Boutin.
Sit down.
You have the papers?
All of them:
Surgeon, lawyer, hospital.
Sit down.
We're training the sons of war dead.
So that the truth is re-established.
Two days ago I despaired of recovering even my name.
I was going to stand in the street... and howl for justice.
Now justice is done.
The papers say I'm Chabert. I'll be awarded the rest.
- The rest? - Yes.
My money. My rank.
My wife. Chabert. Colonel Chabert.
You had no children. They've had two together.
You only reported your survival after their marriage. Morally, your position is weak.
You face a woman who no longer loves you, and her husband.
Powerful people who can influence the courts.
- Justice is justice, no?
- Yes, but merely justice. Let us compromise with it.
Compromise is the key.
- You claimed we'd win.
- I still do. But in 5, 10, 20 years of bickering...
We baffle them, so we're strong now.
It could go quickly, out of court. - And honor?
- Honor is living openly and well.
I'll get a settlement of 400,000, maybe more.
We'll offer to annul your marriage... If the Ferrauds help annul your death certificate.
Alive again, you'll retire with a general's rank.
Every penniless country girl... will be at your feet.
But I will have sold my girl... My wife.
Derville!
Good morning, my dear Derville.
Madam, I haven't much time... and we have a serious matter to discuss.
I'm crushed! My husband's away.
I'm delighted. He'd have been crushed to hear us.
Delbecq says you can manage your own affairs well.
I'll call Delbecq.
I know his skill and devotion to you... But...believe me, we're better off alone.
I do declare, your face and voice are frightening. A few words will turn you serious, Madam.
Chabert is alive. I've seen him. I know him.
Stop clowning. What won't you think of!
Must I show you the papers proving your first husband's survival?
It's a lie.
This so-called Colonel Chabert must be an imposter, an ex-convict.
Can Chabert return to life?
Bonaparte sent an aide to inform me... of his death, and I was awarded 3000 francs... in pension, as his widow. By the Chamber.
I rightly rejected all the Chaberts who turned up... as I will those to come.
Luckily, we're alone. We can tell lies.
I wouldn't take on a fraud. You know that.
You're representing this impostor?
I pitied him, and he has so much proof.
I'm sure I can easily disprove his "proofs".
No. They are strong enough to cancel the death certificate.
Lose on that, and you lose the rest.
Whose cause are you defending?
His...or mine?
I'm still your lawyer, as I am Colonel Chabert's.
Do you think I want to lose a client... as valuable as you?
You're not listening.
- I am. I can hardly wait to hear the rest.
I'm in a position to know how large your fortune is.
It's colossal.
- Is that a reproach?
- Not at all. I admire your ability to make it grow.
But it began as Colonel Chabert's.
He left me far less than I have now!
Calm yourself, please. On the one hand, this fortune.
On the other hand, the poverty of a man you refuse to aid.
Aid means acknowledgment!
Reducing him to beggary will harm your reputation.
Then let's go to court!
I may lose 100,000 to your "Mr. Chabert"... but my second marriage will be legalized because of my children.
How do we know how the courts will see a matter of the heart?
We have a mother and her children... versus an old man forced into poverty and misfortune... by fate, but also by you.
Judges are rarely young men in the prime of life. They'll see a lost, wrinkled Chabert... unable to find another wife, and then... you'd go to court, but courts are public.
Places where secrets are unveiled, proclaimed.
Your opponent is never mute. A good lawyer can paint you in odious colors... and arouse... an unexpected enemy.
I'm giving you a friendly warning of the risk.
An unexpected enemy?
Your husband, Count Ferraud.
Count Ferraud prizes me. - I'm the mother of his children...
- I'm a lawyer!
Don't talk such nonsense to a man who knows the human heart.
Right now, I'm sure he loves you... and has no wish to break the ties that bind you.
Imagine him learning... that his marriage could be annulled.
He'd refuse.
No, Madam.
He'd need...strong reasons.
Isn't the strongest that, with his marriage annulled... he'd see no obstacle to a new union?
I know French peers anxious to marry off a daughter. A royal decree... could make the peerage hereditary... from father-in-law to son-in-law.
I'll never have any lawyer but you, Derville.
Thank you, Countess.
What should I do?
Compromise.
Negotiate. That's always the way.
The Colonel...
Do you think he still loves me?
I can't imagine he'd feel otherwise.
I'll send you an agreement... acceptable to both parties.
You could have your first meeting... in a few days.
Trying to get sick?
- I slept badly.
- When's the meeting?
- Noon.
- You've time for a nap.
No.
For a woman.
Really! Especially your own.
They're only in case I push on to Pomains.
There's no public coach, but a lone rider's not safe.
Army deserters.
Keep an eye on Gilbert in my absence.
He's hovering around Julie.
So?
He's promised to Mathilde.
If he toys with a rival, we may lose him and Mathilde.
What do you care?
I'm attached to him. He knows horses.
What'll you do in Pomains?
More questions.
I heard that the Marquis de Termesson's sister lives there.
In Pomains.
She'll sell the land bordering my estate at the right price.
You said you were too poor for any extravagance.
A good reason to drive a hard bargain with the old witch.
Unless you lend me the money I need.
I said no.
Never mind, Berry!
I'd only need 80,000. That's nothing to you.
For me, it completes my entailment... without resorting to usurers.
I'm going to Groslay to set the new farm rents.
- You'd lend that sum to anyone.
- I'm short of cash. It all went into the sugar refinery.
The sugar refinery! Progress!
A fortune built on beets.
I didn't dictate our marriage contract. Your demands are working against you... and I manage my fortune as I see fit.
I gave you a name. And a rank. - That's worth...
- Two children? You have them. Including a son which is beyond price.
You never listen to me. Or to Delbecq.
Only to the old fogies in the peerage... scheming for riches.
Don't go away angry.
I'll talk to Delbecq, see what we can do.
40,000...
Be cautious.
You're seeing Derville today?
Just for a few signatures.
Berry, the Count is leaving.
- This dress, Madam?
- Yes, put it on the bed.
You'll never see her again... our maid Julie.
I'm firing her.
You value Gilbert, I value Mathilde. And you.
Hurry! My appointment's in an hour.
I saw her! She's coming!
Chief!
She's here!
Hush, Simonnin!
Not so loud!
Scat! You'll wear a wig, not a hat!
And your Legion of Honor.
You must be impressive, very impressive!
Mr. Derville is in his office, Countess.
She visits Count Ferraud on odd days... and Colonel Chabert on even ones!
On leap years she evens the "count"!
I bet a box of candy... they kiss and make up.
She's a man-eating tiger. She'll gobble up Chabert!
I didn't know if you wanted to see Count Chabert... so I separated you.
I'm grateful for the courtesy.
I'll be in the next room... where Boucard will note the parties' reactions.
Mr. Chabert has agreed to stay in the adjoining room.
I can read aloud a proposal you can both hear.
I'll sound you out for your opinions.
Let's begin, Derville.
Very well, Madam.
"It is agreed this day... in the office of Mr. Derville... attorney, and in his presence, between... on the one side, Mr. Chabert...
Amédée Jacques Hyacinthe...
Count... Brigadier General, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor... domiciled in Pre Saint Gervais... and, on the other side...
Madam Chapotel, Rose... Marie Cecile... wife of...
- Skip the preliminaries!
They explain your respective positions.
- The terms! - I'm coming to them.
"In Article One of this agreement... you recognize before me and my head clerk...
Amédée Boucard..."
- Hello, Boucard.
- My respects, Countess.
"You agree that the aforesaid person, whose identity is given... in an ordinance held by Alexandre Crottat... attorney succeeding to Roguin... is your first husband, Colonel Chabert.
The said Colonel and Count Chabert agrees... first, to renounce all rights this bestows. Second, to begin proceedings to dissolve the marriage... in the month after his death certificate is annulled... provided that the financial clauses are fulfilled.
You are given two choices:
An annual payment of 30,000 francs... recorded in the public register..."
Which involves some publicity.
No, our agreement must be kept secret!
Quite right, Madam.
"The alternative... closes the case with the payment... the payment of a flat... and final sum of... 420,000 francs."
That's absurd!
420,000 is absurd!
It's far too much!
The sum's preposterous!
400,000 is the minimum.
Be reasonable, Derville.
Does your money come so easily?
150,000, and that's a lot.
- 400,000.
- No!
400,000, no!
180,000.
But, Madam... What do you expect?
I reject these indecent claims.
But I want no lawsuit. I know what I want.
For the Colonel to stay dead?
Then I'll go to court!
I prefer that!
A lawsuit!
I'm no pushover!
400,000 is fraud!
It's madness!
Then let's go to court!
I'll tell how I left you over a million!
And how you haggle over my revival.
That man is not Colonel Chabert.
I'll prove our intimacy.
Describe the secret marks on your body.
You want a suit?
So do I!
She was in a brothel!
The first time I had her... I bet 100 francs in a lottery and won her!
Don't rush off!
I've a lot to say!
I want 420,000!
And my rights!
By law, I've two days a month of conjugal rights.
Now I want them!
Two days a month.
Two days. Two nights.
He's insane!
He should be locked up, put in a straitjacket!
Two days, two nights, like old times, Countess!
Like the brothel!
Courtrooms love to hear about sluts!
_BAR_ We'll see if I'm mad!
It's all over. Get to work.
Not a word about this!
Your identity's proven. She blanched when she saw you.
Her pallor is worth an affidavit.
Boucard, the Colonel's hat.
- A madhouse. I'll kill her.
- You'll be caught and guillotined.
I'll take this medal and have your name engraved on it.
Forget about killing a woman you might miss.
That would be an unforgivable error.
Put on your hat.
I'm not mad, you know. It's criminal to say so!
Go home. I'll file the suit. We'll do fine.
Our terms stand. I want to see you happy.
Avoid traps. Agree to nothing, sign nothing without asking me.
Be wary. We have weapons and your wife knows it.
She knows it.
Come.
Please. Why hold back?
Sir, I recognized you.
Please understand.
How could I admit to my mistakes... confess in front of all those people?
I did get your letters... but a year after your death. I'd already remarried. A month before.
You were my sole support.
I'd only been tolerated on your account.
Without you, I was nobody again.
Then I met Ferraud.
He's been good to me.
Very good.
You got my letters.
But soiled, and scarcely legible.
I feared I was being tricked by a false Chabert.
Then... a new family relieved my mourning.
You mourned me?
Where are you taking me?
To my country house in Groslay.
if you have the time to spare, we can decide what course to take.
It's my private retreat.
In Paris we know too many people. We're always entertaining.
Count Ferraud's colleagues.
He's on the Council of State.
Prominent men, members of the Academy, judges.
No one comes here. It's peaceful.
Count Ferraud... likes to rest here.
The children love the place.
Count Ferraud designed the gardens himself.
- Don't you ever say "my husband"?
- May I?
Delbecq, my steward. Knows the price of everything!
Colonel Chabert, the hero of...
You know. I need a few moments to give orders.
I want the children here early tommorrow.
It's been arranged, Madam.
And the Colonel?
It's trickier than I expected.
Like it?
Yes.
It's beautiful.
Just what I'd have given you when I made general.
I'll sell it.
How do I get the 400,000 Derville's asking for?
Come. I'll show you your room.
You were sure I'd come here?
I hoped we'd already have reached an agreement.
Alas. Why "alas"? It's easy to agree.
I doubted the whole world, Rose...
You, myself. Be reasonable!
You're still so lovely.
Reasonable? Aren't we man and wife?
Even if the law's on your side, I'm no longer yours.
My heart's changed.
You mustn't love me like your wife.
I love someone else.
Life tore us apart, the harm's already done.
Why reopen old wounds?
I appeal to you.
Lieutenant.
You can take me by force. But I love Ferraud... and my children.
When Fate made me a widow... I wasn't yet a mother.
So the dead are wrong to reappear.
I'll summon you when dinner's ready.
Nothing but my share. And not even all of that.
You were part of it... and I lost you. You know how our luck changes in life. Misfortunes occur, houses burn, sickness comes...
People die. It's everyone's lot.
My lot is that I'm not dead. I've had sickness, misfortune.
But my house didn't burn. It was stolen, and I nabbed the thief!
I just want half of what was in it.
In the house.
The solution's simple.
When...the bad news came... I had to obey the law. - So I went to a lawyer...
- Roguin?
Yes. I drew up an inventory of your estate.
Life doesn't change as much as you say.
Countess Chabert, Countess Ferraud.
Scratch the polish and you find Rose Chapotel... who sells a ten-cent object for three francs.
The inventory... was checked, line by line. Everything of value has vanished.
The tapestries... the gold coins, the silver...
Josephine's punch bowl.
400,000, no!
How much?
180,000?
No.
300,000.
It's too much.
250,000.
I can't rob my children without further thought.
Ferraud's ambitious. I help him the best I can.
If you fleece me too... 200,000?
Well, let's see. What do I need?
A small house in the heartland. It's Boutin's region.
He'll give fencing lessons.
Rabbits, chickens... fishing, firewood for winter... a newspaper and my tobacco.
On 1000 a month I'll live like a prince.
Who can live on 1000 a month?
I haven't always had a hundredth of that.
Ten francs?
No, not always.
Ten francs?
Can you really?
Ten francs for a whole month?
No, you can't. But you survive.
And regret it.
You can very well regret living.
My God... How you've changed.
You too. Changed.
No more laughter? With Ferraud... Do you laugh?
No.
I'm sure you don't, not even in bed.
I bet you play the Duchess... with that dummy.
Still snickering.
You only know how to roughhouse women or laugh at them. I won't give in.
Ferraud and you, two hounds in a pack biting at opposite sides.
Normally he'd protect me from you... but when he hears you're back I'll read my doom in his eyes.
But you keep telling me you two are in love.
I am, yes!
He still pretends to be. But women can read men like an open book.
An open book.
My God!
I'm so frightened!
Madam, the children have arrived.
I'll be right down.
The old man didn't sleep in his bed.
I saw him go out. His bed was still made.
All right.
He slept on top of it.
Here you are, Delbecq!
- What do I do about the Colonel?
- We'll pay him off. No. It's not the money.
He's frightening.
It's a mask. I'm terrified.
He yields, looks away, I think I've won.
Then he looks back, and I see nothing's settled.
I find him affable.
Believe me, he's an ogre.
If he recovers his name and title, what then?
- If I may ask, has he given you up? - Yes.
Today.
Then we've won.
No, it's a drunkard's oath. On a whim, or bad advice, or his lust for women.
I saw the heron fly off.
I saw the nest.
Three eggs.
Eggs.
What comes out may not be a bird. It could be... A snake, a turtle...
A dragon with two heads.
Take the children inside!
Mathilde!
- But, Madam...
- Take them inside. It's still too cold.
In Egypt there are big lizards called crocodiles... that also come out of eggs.
Hurry!
You frighten them.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
Weeping again?
I can see you are.
Delbecq said I was rash to bring you here without telling my husband.
If the Count learns, he may cast me off.
I won't tell him.
But my children saw you!
They'll talk.
They'll be taken from me.
I couldn't survive that.
I'd kill myself!
For me, it's settled. I thought it over last night.
I've made my decision.
Don't worry. Give me 12,000 francs a year... plus a coach and horse, and that's that.
You mean...
You'll hear no more of your dead husband.
But... you could change your mind... tomorrow, or an hour from now.
Is that how you see me?
No.
I trust your generosity. But your decision forces you into a vow of silence. A permanent lie.
You're better off dead.
Death is gentler than you think.
They'll want proof of your good will.
I can't live waiting for you to reappear on some pretext.
You're not wicked, but you're so capricious.
Even before, you were thought of as weird, remember?
Your head wound must have accentuated that.
My word's not enough?
You want forms, stamps, seals, official edicts?
Then let's go back to Derville.
Why Derville?
If you agree, there's a lawyer here.
We can settle it today.
Fine, so we'll use this lawyer.
He's very convenient, isn't he?
The silver?
Yes, she always did that.
The Countess. Always.
"Before you die, make silver shine", they say.
"A token of friendship.
Josephine."
The Empress. Her punch bowl. A wedding gift.
Where's the Countess?
In her office, end of the hall.
- But her lawyer's with her.
- I know. He's here for me.
This is...the cosigner.
Sir, the Countess has requested me... to read you this agreement...
- It's already drawn up?
- Lawyers know how.
All right. You may read it.
"On this June 14, 1817... was made before Mr. Sarrazin, attorney in Montmorency... with Marie Gratien and Leon Delbecq acting as witnesses... the following agreement:
Countess Ferraud, born Rose Chapotel... agrees to an annual payment to the cosigner... until the death of either... the sum of 12,000 francs... in twelve equal parts of 1000 francs... to be paid on the first day of each month.
In addition to this sum, Attorney Derville will receive... a single flat fee of 2000 francs.
In return for this... the cosigner agrees to renounce forever... the usurped identity of Colonel Chabert... which he admits he took fraudulently..."
How could you imagine I'd sign such a paper?
I wanted to see how far this sham would go.
I didn't think you could stoop so low.
- I told you I'd given up.
- On the money, yes. But your name's a threat.
I need to be sure. What's in a name?
My name, Madam, is my honor.
Honor!
What honor?
That of being a burden to society... a madman who can't manage his life without help?
Madam...
I thank the fate that separated us.
I won't curse you. I despise you.
I don't even want revenge.
I want nothing from her.
She can believe my word's worth more than any lawyer's scribble.
I'll never claim the name I glorified and she dishonors.
Don't touch me!
Please understand. Without the children...
Without the children?
You'd be dead.
"She'd have loved to see me foam and scream the insults she deserved... to give her a pretext to call me mad... so she could have me locked away at Charenton.
Dear Mr. Derville...
I've suddenly contracted an incurable ailment:
Disgust with humanity.
You could scarcely measure my contempt for the world... and the public life most men value.
Except for Boutin and you.
You listened and helped me more than a son might have done.
Now I'm returning underground.
I may not have shown you my gratitude for your kindness... but I hold it prominently in my heart. It reigns there, fully intact.
But what more can the unfortunate do?
They love, and that's all.
Good men like you put fine thoughts above fine clothes.
I fear no man's scorn.
Farewell, and thank you."
Death can strike a person without dissolving the family.
It can even enlarge the group... by bringing forth unknown relatives.
But that's not your case.
All right.
Derville?
You didn't say you were coming.
I didn't come to see you, Madam.
Not you alone, in any case.
You wished to see me?
- Yes, he's surprised me!
The latest list of new peers, Count.
I know. Four idiots who passed me by.
They're young, Count. They'll be there a long time.
Gonpalet! He grew rich swindling under Napoleon... he's led a life of debauchery.
Mistresses, bastards...
But skill in corruption, wealth, and a knowledge of the law...
- You're here for that?
- Indirectly, yes. A possible connection.
A surprise. A visit I received that you weren't told about... though it offers us a way...
You're being mysterious. What's this about?
A way to do what?
A way, perhaps... to reverse those unjust nominations.
- I don't see...
- The peerage, Count.
Chabert is alive. I've seen him.
Chabert?
Your first husband?
The dead have come back to life.
That's impossible!
He came to see me. It's him.
There's a mass of proof.
Now's the time to decide, Armand.
If you drag me into court... they'll have to declare him alive.
He's dropped his claims... but this frees you from the chains of marriage. Isn't that right?
It's true that no one in France may have two wives... or two husbands.
I mean, officially.
Incredible!
You hid all this from me?
For how many days or weeks have you lied?
Lied?
Why lied?
I fought. Your raging desire to crawl toward the Throne.
The peerage!
What misery it put me through!
All those smiles for people we both despised.
Those concerts, suppers, meetings. Each one left you more distant from me.
The blame in your eyes... the cold courtesy toward me, the obstacle to your ambition.
Without my money...
Countess...
Count... I am at your disposal at all times.
Good day, Sister.
Your protegé is in the arcade today.
- Is he settling in?
- Well, he's very docile.
Thank you, Sister.
Colonel Chabert, you look like a mere lieutenant.
No.
Not Chabert. Hyacinthe. Old Man Hyacinthe.
Number 164, room 7.
I brought you some country cheese. - And white bread!
- White? Say!
The Countess, your wife, is retiring to the country.
She still has a future.
White bread.
Nice!
Count Ferraud hints he'll wed... the oldest Courcelle girl.
That will make him a Peer of France within two years.
I also brought a flask of red wine.
You saw the condemned man?
This wine... is not as strong as last time.
And tobacco.
Good tobacco.
Chabert!
But I can describe Death. Death is red, then blue.
And then it's cold.
Above all, it's silent.
Death is the silence of death.
A meadow in early morning somewhere on earth.
Hidden here is the world as wast as our own where the weeds are like inpenetrable jungles, stones are mountains, and even the smallest pond becomes an ocean
Time passes differently here, an hour is like a day, a day is like a season, and the passing of a season is a lifetime.

Princess Mononoke (1997) 1080p (12audio) MultiSubs (OST) Extras (Fan Collection) hime (BDrip) [KoTuWa]
Dentsu and Studio Ghibli present
In ancient times the land lay covered in forest.
Here dwelt the spirits of nature from time immemorial.
PRINCESS MONONOKE
Yakul!
Ashitaka!
Oracle says to get back to the village.
too.
- Something's wrong.
- The birds are gone.
The animals too.
I'll go to him.
You'd better go now.
Something's coming.
- What is it?
- Don't know.
It's not human.
Oracle summoned everyone back to the village.
There!
A demon god!
run!
It'll attack the village!
Ashitaka!
Don't touch it!
Its curse will be on you!
Yakul!
I beg you!
why do you rampage so?
- A monster!
- Run!
Stop!
Leave our village in peace!
Stop!
Still your rage!
Get up!
- It's down!
- Ashitaka!
Bring Oracle!
Stoke the fire!
Ashitaka.
Don't touch it.
It's no ordinary wound.
He's hurt!
Where's Oracle?
stay back!
Oracle!
slowly.
O raging god unknown to us I bow before you.
we will raise a mound and perform rites.
Bear us no hate.
Be at peace.
loathsome humans!
You shall know my agony and my hatred.
very bad.
The boar-spirit came from far to the west.
rotting his flesh... making a demon of him.
Prince Ashitaka... show us your right arm.
Oracle!
are you ready to face your destiny?
Yes.
I was resolved when I let my arrow fly.
The poison will seep into your bones and you will die.
Can nothing be done?
!
He fought for the women and the village!
To simply wait for death...
We cannot change our fate.
But we can rise to meet it.
Look.
This was deep in the boar's body.
His suffering was terrible.
The iron shattered his bones and tore his entrails.
What else could have made him that way?
Something sinister waits in the lands to the west.
If you journey there and search for evil with eyes unclouded... you might find a way to lift the curse.
More than 500 years have passed... since the Emperor drove us into this land.
Now we hear how his power fades... and the fangs of his Shoguns are broken.
But the blood of our tribe likewise grows thin.
bitter fate... the youth who was one day to lead us must journey far to the west.
The Law forbids us to watch you go.
Farewell.
you can't be here.
I don't care.
Remember me with this.
Your jewel dagger.
It will protect you.
without fail.
Kaya.
Fighting?
Head them off!
get him!
His head is mine!
Stop!
My arm!
Don't let him get away.
Stay back.
Let me pass!
A demon!
The mark is getting darker.
This gruel tastes like hot water.
There he is!
Is this enough?
This isn't money.
Give me back my rice!
let me take a look.
this is pure gold!
I'll pay you.
Give me this.
is there a money-changer here?
No?
but I'd say this is worth three sacks of rice.
wait!
give it back!
don't be in such a hurry.
No need to thank me.
It is I who should thank you.
I saw how you dealt with those samurai.
You fight like one possessed.
You see them too?
Keep your gold hidden.
Hearts have grown hard throughout the land.
They'll rob you in your sleep.
Shall we run?
So the boar became a demon... but lost them in the village.
I'm not surprised.
Look around you.
This used to be a fine village.
or a landslide.
I'm sure many died.
The land teems with bitter ghosts... sick or starved and fallen where they stood.
you say?
This world is a curse.
this is good!
I shouldn't have gotten into that fight.
I killed two men.
You helped me escape.
Give me your bowl.
You need food.
Everyone dies.
some later.
an elegant bowl.
You remind me of the Emishi of old.
A brave people far to the east.... who used stone arrowheads and rode red elk.
The trick is to avoid the jaws of death.
Or so my master used to say.
my boy.
It's your rice.
Look at this.
What is it?
It was in the body of the giant boar.
This is what killed him.
deep in the mountains... is a forest where none may tread.
- The forest of the Deer God.
- The Deer God?
as in ages past.
I knew he'd go...
It's not far now.
Stay on your guard.
They're coming.
The wolves!
Calm the oxen.
Don't rush.
Form ranks.
Keep your powder dry!
Wait until they're close.
fire!
fire!
That was too easy.
Those were just the pups.
Where's the mother?
It's Moro.
Moro!
Got her!
She's immortal.
She won't die from that.
She did some real damage.
Let's get going.
What about those who fell?
Form ranks and move out.
He's breathing.
Hang on!
My name is Ashitaka!
I come from the east.
Are you ancient gods from the forest of the Deer God?
Leave!
too?
Don't move.
You're hurt.
They won't harm you.
They're a sign the woods are healthy.
They'll bring the Deer God.
The Deer God?
The giant wolf?
far bigger.
The mother of all beasts.
It's gone!
Yakul's not afraid.
There's no danger here.
Please let us pass through your woods.
Let's go back.
Please!
There's a trail across the river.
We'll never get through these woods.
The current's too strong to cross.
this man will die.
Are you guiding us or getting us lost?
these sprites aren't helping us.
There are more of them!
What a magnificent tree.
Is she your mother?
That girl and the wolves... so this is where they live... sir.
This way leads into the other world.
let's take a rest.
Footprints.
Three toes... still fresh.
sir?
Are you all right?
You're awfully pale.
I told you!
Did you see something?
forget it.
Hang on a little longer.
I'm sorry.
It's gone.
What is this?
I feel much stronger.
Hey!
It doesn't hurt.
it's broken.
you're a genius.
We're back at the ironworks!
- It's a castle.
- Lady Eboshi's ironworks.
They melt sand into iron.
Hey!
Hey!
- Someone's coming from the woods!
- A monster?
Koroku the ox-driver!
he's crossing the lake!
What's all this noise?
Be quiet when I'm writing.
Koroku's back from the dead!
What?
You're not a ghost.
- Where are the others?
- There were two more.
Only we were saved.
The guards never get killed.
Step aside.
sir?
An outsider.
listen!
This gentleman carried us all the way here.
Show some gratitude.
Ouch!
Don't grab me there.
You!
Wait there!
I thank you for helping our men.
But something bothers me.
You got here in less than half the time we did... carrying two...
Koroku!
You're alive!
Toki!
You fool!
How can you drive oxen with that broken leg?
But... Scaring me half to death! The wolves should've eaten you.
Then I could find a better man.
Toki.
take your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.
leaving them to die!
Some guard you are.
You don't lift a finger around here.
do something!
It couldn't be helped... but I'm glad he's safe.
Good.
I was afraid maybe I'd done something wrong.
You seem very handsome.
Show us your face.
Gonza.
I would like to thank the traveler.
Bring him to me later.
Koroku.
It's good you're back.
I apologize.
Lady Eboshi.
He'll just take advantage of you.
Toki.
I shouldn't have let it happen.
if you hadn't been there... they'd all be cavorting inside the wolves by now.
please stop and rest.
Hey!
You are handsome!
you know.
Dish it out!
Where?
Is that him?
Toki was right!
- He is handsome!
- A bit young.
That never stopped you before.
Quiet out there.
We lost two men.
There are plenty of handsome men here.
Cowherds!
traveler!
Forget this stinking barn.
Watch your mouth!
We risked our lives for the rice you're eating.
Who made the iron that bought the rice?
We work those bellows all night long.
if you don't mind.
Really?
We'll have to work in makeup.
Even rouge!
we'll be waiting.
sir.
Lady Eboshi spoils them.
A good village has happy women.
But women working the bellows in an ironworks?
Their presence defiles the iron.
Eboshi buys their freedom.
that's all.
old man.
or of curses.
either.
You should've seen her fighting Nago!
Nago?
A huge boar-god.
He ruled the forest around here.
We couldn't go into the mountains.
All we could do was look up at them.
We used up the iron in the sand by the lake.
Many people had their eye on this place.
The boars got them all.
we have to clear the trees.
Nago went wild.
There they go again!
Then Lady Eboshi came along with her muskets.
Sir?
What's wrong?
Does your arm hurt?
I was thinking about that boar.
He must have died full of hate.
Ashitaka.
That's good iron.
We had to make tomorrow's shipment.
Let's rest now.
Tell the others.
or the monsters.
There are many who covet our iron.
May I ask why you're here?
You must recognize this.
rotted his flesh and made him a monster.
a curse unto death.
Where is your land?
I've never seen an elk like yours.
Between north and east.
That's all I will say.
you!
Answer her or I'll cut you in two!
And when you find the one who made that?
and decide.
Eyes unclouded?
I see.
I'll show you my secret.
Come.
Lady Eboshi!
Gonza.
No one dares enter this garden.
if you would know my secret.
We're coming in.
We just finished.
It's still heavy.
It's light in your hands.
it will burst.
It's not just for me.
The women will be using them.
Won't that be a sight!
This is the new musket these people have designed.
Chinese muskets are too heavy.
This will kill monsters and pierce samurai armor.
Watch out.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the country.
I'm sorry to rush you.
I'll send sake later.
Won't that be nice!
You stole the boar's woods and made a monster of him.
Will you breed new hatred and evil with those weapons?
I'm sorry you suffer.
The musket ball you found is mine.
That hapless boar should have cursed me instead.
Your right hand wants to kill me?
Perhaps that would lift this curse.
But my hand would not be stayed.
Must it kill us all to find peace?
Osa wants to say something.
do not scorn the young man's strength.
I too am cursed.
I understand your rage and grief... but I beg you not to kill our lady.
She is the only person who ever treated us as human.
She did not fear our disease.
She washed and bandaged our flesh.
- Osa...
- Life is suffering and pain.
but we still wish to live.
Forgive my foolish babbling.
They're back.
They come at night to plant trees and take back the mountain.
and work with me?
Would you seize even the Deer God's forest?
the wild ones are mere beasts.
this will be a land of riches.
Even Princess Mononoke will be human again.
Princess Mononoke?
The wild girl whose soul the wolves stole.
She lives to kill me.
The blood of the Deer God is said to cure disease.
even lift your curse.
Lady Eboshi!
How does it handle?
Very well made.
Perfect for conquering the country.
- But still a bit heavy.
- Hard to please.
Look who's here!
let me try the bellows.
Wait!
May I try?
Let him see what it's like.
What strength!
You really came!
I told you he's an handsome man.
she's fixing her kimono!
traveler.
It's hard work.
we work four days straight.
Is life hard here?
but it's better than in the towns.
We eat our fill and the men know their place.
I see.
- You're leaving tomorrow?
- You should stay longer.
You can help us.
but there is someone I must meet.
She's here.
Princess Mononoke!
It's her!
Stop!
I don't want to fight you!
She's after the Lady!
keep her inside!
Steady at your posts!
She's up on the roof.
Don't get excited.
Keep working.
We must keep the fire going.
- Is she alone?
- Yes.
We have her cornered.
She came for you.
let's go.
Princess Mononoke?
Here I am.
You wish to avenge your tribe.
There are some here who seek vengeance for husbands... killed by your wolves.
Come out!
We have scores to settle!
There she is!
Princess Mononoke!
Stay out of the line of fire!
It's a trap.
Stop!
go back to your woods!
Don't die for nothing.
Go back!
I knew it!
Let him do as he likes.
Got her!
She's falling.
Don't move.
A wolf's severed head can still bite.
Aim where she falls.
Fire!
Stay back!
Wake up!
No!
Get her!
Don't let her go.
Kill her!
sir?
Don't worry about me.
Go!
Villain!
You're one of them too.
Halt!
Step aside.
Ashitaka?
Her life is mine.
Will you marry the wolf princess?
There is a demon inside you.
And in her.
Look!
This is the hatred and bitterness that curses me!
It rots my flesh and summons my death.
You cannot yield to it.
Enough talk of your curse.
I'll cut that arm off!
Lady Eboshi!
Someone help me.
Don't worry.
She'll recover.
I will take the girl!
Wait!
You hurt Lady Eboshi!
Don't move!
no!
He still lives... sir.
fall in!
They won't get away.
quick!
You're... you may not pass.
The gate may not be opened without orders.
Please turn back.
You helped us.
We don't want to harm you.
of my own will.
No... it takes ten men to open that gate.
no!
You'll die!
It's moving... Out of the way!
Wolves!
Flint!
Flint!
Stop.
Your princess is safe!
We're coming.
let's go.
Thank you.
He's gone.
Wait!
He's mine.
Did they shoot you?
Are you going to die?
Why did you stop me?
Speak while you still live!
I didn't want you to die.
I'm not afraid to die if it will drive away the humans!
I knew that when I first saw you.
You've wasted your life by getting in my way!
I'll cut your throat!
That'll shut you up.
Live...
I don't listen to humans!
You're beautiful...
San?
Shall I tear him apart?
It's the apes.
Apes!
Do you insult the tribe of Moro?
This forest ours.
Give us man.
Give us man and go.
Be gone before my fangs find you.
Go.
We eat man.
We eat him.
Let us eat man.
Why would the tribe of the apes want to eat a man?
We eat man.
We get his strength.
We get strength to drive humans away.
You won't get that power by eating a man.
All that will do is defile you and turn you into something else!
We plant trees.
Humans kill them.
Forest not come back.
We kill humans.
The Deer God is with us.
Don't give up.
Plant your trees.
Moro's tribe is fighting for you!
Deer God not fight.
We die.
Wolf girl not care.
Wolf girl human.
Monkey!
I'll break your neck!
Stop it!
It's all right.
You go ahead.
I'll deal with the human.
What about him?
Can we eat him?
you can't.
Now go on.
Come here.
Let's be friends.
Help me carry your master.
You're smart.
You know not to set foot on this island.
That human stench.
Go where you will.
You're free.
There he is!
the Nightwalker!
come and look.
That's why we've been sitting in these stinking bearskins.
you'll go blind!
And you call yourselves hunters?
This decree from the Emperor allows us to subdue the Deer God!
Now he's the Nightwalker.
he becomes a deer again.
He's going in. There!
- Jiko!
- I saw them.
Over there.
There must be hundreds of them.
They're not from these woods.
They're lords of some other forest.
It's Okkoto!
He swam across the straits?
No other boar has those tusks.
He brought his whole tribe.
He knows we're here.
Run!
jump!
There's no wound.
Yakul... thank Yakul.
He never left your side.
You know his name?
about your village and its forest.
because the Deer God saved your life.
I had a dream... a golden deer...
Eat this.
Chew.
We're here to kill humans and save the forest.
Why are humans here?
my daughter.
There are humans everywhere.
Go back to your homeland and kill them there.
We kill for the forest of the Deer God.
Why is the man here?
The Deer God healed him.
He should leave here alive.
The Deer God saved him?
The Deer God healed a human?
Why did he not save Nago?
Does the Deer God not protect all in the forest?
The Deer God gives life and takes it away.
Have you boars forgotten that?
You begrudge us the Deer God's favor.
You did nothing to help Nago!
as do I.
I also carry within me a poisoned human stone.
Nago fled.
I will stay here and face my death.
Ask the Deer God for help.
San.
The Deer God would probably take my life.
Mother!
You protect the Deer God.
You lie!
Nago was beautiful and strong.
Our brother would never run.
You wolves ate him!
Silence!
You slander my mother!
all of you.
It was I who killed Nago.
He became a demon and attacked our village.
A huge boar.
Here is my proof.
I came to this land to ask the Deer God to lift this curse.
but Nago's curse remains.
I must suffer until his curse destroys me.
someone with some sense.
wait!
You mustn't eat him.
You are Moro's daughter.
I have heard of you.
Your eyes...
Stand back.
I will not eat him.
Wolf Princess...
Fear not.
I tell of Nago's end.
young one.
It grieves us that our tribe spawned a demon.
how I may lift the curse?
Leave this forest.
I must kill you.
You cannot win against the fire stones of the humans.
Moro.
We grow small and stupid.
Soon we will be nothing more than game for the humans to hunt.
you'll play into their hands.
I seek no help from wolves.
we will leave the humans in awe.
The Deer God...
Keep the oxen together!
Hold your fire.
Let them come.
Fire!
Reload!
Quick!
That damned Eboshi's fighting the wrong enemy.
Go on ahead and hide.
It's them!
They've returned.
- Jiko!
- Well done.
We're moving out.
Tell the others.
Jiko.
His Majesty is impatient.
This is no time for sport with country samurai.
Lord Asano sends them against me.
Asano?
He's a powerful man.
He wants half my iron.
How greedy of him.
This is no time to fight men.
The boars are gathering in the forest.
Give Asano all your iron.
then smash Asano.
Lady Eboshi!
Asano's men are coming.
Speak of the devil. A messenger.
An envoy approaches.
Remember your manners.
Welcome home!
Aren't you going to receive him?
you fight well!
I bring a message from my lord.
Open the gate!
We can hear you from there.
Our lady took this mountain from the boars.
Now it's worth something and you want it.
On your way!
woman!
Impudent?
We've been impudent since the day we were born!
You want iron?
Take some!
Eboshi's women are quite impressive!
they don't care.
They certainly don't lack for courage.
What good is this paper?
It's helped me get the best hunters and trackers.
not just beasts.
my lady?
Do you know who this comes from?
- The Son of Heaven.
- The what?
The Emperor.
it's nothing special.
Off you go.
the weaker the forest becomes.
We lose fewer lives.
We've spent too much time and money.
We didn't send 40 sharpshooters just for the iron.
At least that's what His Majesty would say.
Surely he doesn't believe that the head of a god confers immortality?
I'm not privy to his thoughts.
I prefer it that way.
I'll keep my promise.
Boars are easier to deal with than Moro and her tribe.
You can summon that shady bunch hidden under the cliff.
did you?
One more thing...
Did a young man pass through here?
riding a red elk.
He left.
They look frightening.
They're not ordinary hunters.
They're special scouts.
Let us go with you.
Don't trust those men!
We can't help you from here if anything happens!
We know how to shoot.
That's why I need you here.
I fear humans more than monsters.
things will become clear.
Is the Deer God's head all the Emperor really wants?
too.
Men can't be trusted.
Stay on your toes.
Don't worry about Lady Eboshi.
I'll protect her with my life.
- I wonder.
- What!
I'd believe that coming from a woman!
Are you suffering?
you know.
the curse will torment you.
I feel like I've slept for days.
I dreamed San was watching over me.
so I could bite off your head.
These woods are beautiful.
Are the boars moving yet?
boy. You can't hear it...
The forest crying out as the boars move forward.
I hear the forest crying and feel the wasting of my body... and I wait for that woman.
I dream of crushing her head in my jaws.
Can't humans and the forest live in peace?
Can't this be stopped?
The humans are gathering.
even here.
And San?
Will you force her to die with you?
How like a human.
You think only of yourself.
so will she.
Set her free!
She's human.
boy!
What can you do for her?
The humans who violated the forest threw her in my path as they ran from me.
Now she is neither human nor wolf.
lovely daughter.
Can you save her?
but together we can live.
How?
Will you join San and fight the humans?
No. That will only breed more hatred.
There is nothing you can do.
Soon Nago's curse will kill you.
Leave this place at sunrise.
Can you walk?
thanks to you and the Deer God.
Yakul!
Did you worry?
My legs are still weak.
It's too quiet.
Where are the kodama?
I can smell the ironworks.
Thank you for guiding me.
I have a favor to ask.
Give this to San.
Let's go.
What a stench! I can't breathe.
That's tracker's smoke.
It will blunt our sense of smell.
It's her.
- She knows we're here.
- It's a trap.
Trap?
They want to lure the boars out of the woods.
Everything has been planned.
We've got to warn them.
They'll die!
Okkoto is no fool.
but still they'll charge.
They are a proud race.
The last one alive will keep charging forward.
They're cutting trees.
Another provocation.
this is farewell.
The smoke will blind Okkoto.
I'll be his eyes.
San.
But there is a life for you with that boy.
I hate humans!
From Ashitaka... for me?
It's beautiful.
You two go with San.
I will stay with the Deer God.
Let's go.
The tribe of Moro fights with you!
Where is Okkoto?
Thank you!
It's coming from the ironworks.
Let's go.
Halt!
Samurai!
Halt!
Let me pass!
I don't believe it.
He's fending them off.
Don't waste your arrows.
Quick!
it is him.
- It's not a ghost.
Ashitaka!
Toki!
Are you all right?
Of course!
They thought they'd catch us while the men were away.
We showed 'em!
- They thought we'd be easy.
- Where's Lady Eboshi?
She took every man and went after the Deer God.
We're trapped here and can't reach her.
The Deer God?
So that's what I heard.
I've still got your bow.
What about his saddle and cloak?
- I forgot.
- You're useless!
thanks!
I'll bring help.
Can you hold on?
We'll pour hot iron on them if we have to!
Ashitaka!
- Bring Lady Eboshi.
Missed!
They're bringing boats.
Hurry!
too!
I'll be back.
Keep fighting!
We'll be here!
Kill that man!
Yakul!
Burning flesh...
Yakul!
Stay back!
Show me the wound.
Wait here.
I'll be back.
I said!
We're almost there.
Who goes there?
You're not allowed here.
I'm indebted to these men.
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
She's not here.
I'll see that she gets it.
I will speak to her.
Where is she?
you made it after all!
You've suffered badly.
Some men are still buried.
It was horrible.
The ironworks are under attack.
There's still time.
The women are holding the inner stockade.
This cannot stand!
Asano waited until we left.
Where's Lady Eboshi?
She went after the Deer God.
Call her back.
There's no time!
get moving.
Get back to work!
And the ironworks?
Now wait a minute!
They're ready to sacrifice us all.
- There's no time to lose.
- Send Eboshi a message!
She's deep in the woods.
We'll never find her.
then.
They're using Lady Eboshi.
Were there any wolves with the boars?
Have you seen Princess Mononoke?
It was pitch black when they came at us.
She was there.
We were on the front line...
And?
the world turned upside down...
The scouts put us there to lure the boars in.
There were mines underneath us... and grenades from above.
Where's San?
I want to help you.
A wolf!
There's a wolf still alive over here.
what are you...
Sir!
boy?
He'll take me to Eboshi.
are you?
Step aside.
Would you sacrifice these men and their families?
Poison darts!
Stop!
Give me a hand!
He's free!
Go through the swamp and hide near the lake.
They have sharpshooters.
Be careful.
Take this.
My last arrow broke.
Go with them.
Look after him!
Find San.
That's where Eboshi is.
Keep up with the scouts.
We finish this today!
Jiko!
Well?
How does it look?
Okkoto's hurt.
He and the girl are going to the Deer God.
So they're going to ask him for help.
Stay with them.
Keep out of sight or he won't appear.
Of course.
Was that boar blood on his face?
isn't it?
We're almost at the Deer God's pond.
Something's coming!
Okkoto!
We have to keep moving.
Something bad is coming.
I can't smell it.
There's too much blood.
Apes!
You did this.
Your fault.
Forest die.
Is this how you thank those who fought for your forest?
You bring monsters.
Not animal!
Not human!
Neither animal nor human?
- They're here!
- Doom!
Doom!
Scouts?
They're here!
My warriors have returned from the land of the dead.
my warriors!
To the Deer God!
no!
Your warriors haven't come back to life.
The boar skins hide their scent.
Humans!
Stop!
They want us to lead them to the Deer God!
Deer God!
revive my warriors to slay the humans.
Okkoto!
Still your heart!
We're surrounded!
He's done for.
Leave him!
No!
He'll become a demon!
Tell Mother it's the Deer God the humans want.
She'll know what to do.
We can't let our kind die out!
Go!
and tell the forest what you are.
Ashitaka?
Get back!
I burn!
A flame bursts from within me.
No!
Okkoto!
Don't turn into a demon!
Okkoto!
An answer!
- What is it?
- San's in danger!
Let's go!
It's hot!
No!
I don't want to be a demon!
Okkoto!
Too slow.
Get on.
A wolf!
Eboshi...
Go on ahead!
listen to me!
- Cease fire!
- Ashitaka?
The ironworks are under attack.
Forget the Deer God and go back!
The women need help.
Your men are on their way.
They're waiting for you.
What proof do you have?
None!
I would have stayed and fought if I could!
You want me to kill samurai instead of the Deer God?
No! Can't the forest and the ironworks live in peace?
- Whose side is he on?
- Let's go back!
The women can hold their own.
They have weapons and supplies.
There's the pond.
He's close!
It's now or never.
Stay alert.
Do we need her?
We're hunting a god.
Let her do the dirty work.
Moro!
Are you dead?
San!
Where are you?
San!
Ashitaka!
Okkoto... boy.
the god won't come.
Okkoto!
Be still!
Give me Princess Mononoke.
Where is San?
Ashitaka!
San!
Silence him!
Shoot him down!
San!
San!
Ashitaka!
San!
Ashitaka!
And here I was saving my last strength for that woman.
Close up!
Stay away from him.
The curse will fall on you.
Have you lost even the power of speech?
Well done.
Fall back and tend to the wounded.
A horrible sight.
There he is.
Give me back my daughter!
Ashitaka...
Can you save San?
The Deer God...
Don't shoot!
Eboshi!
Your enemy is not the Deer God!
Guns can't hurt him...
Only through the head...
San!
Don't die!
but it gave them death.
all of you.
This is how you kill a god.
This is also the god of death.
Stay close behind me.
Stop!
Eboshi!
Damn you!
Got him!
Get the head!
Jiko!
Bring the box!
The porters are dead!
Quick!
Don't touch the body!
It'll suck the life out of you.
Take it!
The head is yours.
Lady Eboshi!
Moro's head... it moved by itself!
hurry!
Run!
Run!
To the island!
- I can't swim!
- It's shallow.
Bring her here.
I'll kill her!
Moro's had her revenge.
- Lady Eboshi!
- Help me.
Don't waste your sympathy.
I promised Toki I'd bring you back.
It's searching for its head. We can't stay here.
San!
Help me.
No!
You're on their side!
Take her and go away!
Keep away!
I hate humans!
I am human.
So are you.
Shut up!
I'm a wolf!
Don't touch me!
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop it.
Everything is finished.
The forest is dead.
No it's not.
We're still alive.
Help me.
Wait!
Help us!
A little danger and they're useless.
Don't stop!
The head's moving!
It's calling him!
That will fix it.
Thanks.
- It's too quiet.
- They're waiting for dawn.
I wonder if that young man found Eboshi.
I'm sure he did.
She should be here soon.
Koroku!
Let him sleep for now.
What is it?
It sounds unearthly.
The Nightwalker!
Hold your positions!
- It's coming this way.
- We've got to run.
We guard the ironworks!
We promised Lady Eboshi.
It's him!
Ashitaka!
escape!
The Deer God is coming for his head!
Touch that muck and you're dead!
Go to the lake.
The water will protect you.
Lady Eboshi and the men are coming from the other side.
We must return the head!
Hurry!
It's here.
What do we do?
Don't panic.
To the lake!
Stay calm!
Help the injured.
Not that way!
There goes the roof... it's all over.
it isn't.
We're still alive.
Farther... quickly!
There they are!
Go!
Wait!
You're still alive?
That's good.
I'll return the head.
Leave it and go.
Give it back now?
It's too late.
The sun's coming up.
life-sucking god of death.
He'll vanish with the sun.
Jiko.
Quick!
The thirst to possess heaven and earth is what makes us human.
I don't want to kill you.
dear.
Don't look so serious.
Get going!
Ashitaka!
Trapped.
We're surrounded!
come quickly!
- Open it!
Don't you understand?
It's too late.
talking with humans is useless.
Human hands must return it.
I warned you.
O Deer God...
We return your head!
Be at peace!
Here it comes!
- It stopped.
- There they are!
Lady Eboshi!
she's hurt.
It's falling!
Hang on tight!
I didn't know the Deer God made flowers bloom.
look!
these are not the Deer God's woods.
The Deer God is dead.
He can't die.
He is life itself.
He is both life and death.
He is telling us we should live.
Ashitaka.
But I'll never forgive the human race.
and I'll live at the ironworks.
we'll live.
Yakul and I will visit you.
Can you believe it?
Carried to safety by a wolf.
Someone bring Ashitaka.
I want to thank him.
We'll start over.
We'll build a good village here.
I give up. You can't win against fools.

The End
" ජය වේවා!
grateful.... as a gesture of gratitude... not to us... but to who made this movie... and remember their name good work!
Ayubowan!
They believe their own eyes!
I've kept my eyes peeled for 60 years to see a little clearly. The more I see, the less I know what it is I'm seeing.
A hundred times, to know that, I've painted my own face.
Often enough, I've scooped my eye up
out of the mud of my palette.
Often enough I've found my eye there laden with tears.
What's with the old loony?
Don't talk of the Master thus.
His mind's in the past again.
Sold!
The painter, Rembrandt Van Rijn, bankrupt!
For ten years now, before my very eyes I've seen that hammer slam down.
Open up!
Please!
Open up!
I'm afraid.
I pity you!
What do I care?
Did you pity my hands that reached out to you like beggars?
Open up!
I'll show you my bush!
I'll let you feel my tears.
Just let me show you the wreck of my body.
That's right, my beauty, run.
Tell them I'm stil greedy. I always was.
I'm an ogre that stuffs himself and patiently pukes up a mass of light.
Sold!
The price is absurd!
It's worth four times as much!
Frankly, this is murder!
Now I must convert the horror to splendour.
I'll do it, despite my fellow men.
Afterwards, I shall rest.
At the climax of the feast I shall fall still.
I must hurry now, there's not much time.
I must go back once more to the source,
back there, at the wellspring of light,
the golden heart of the mill at Leyden.
Don't leave me!
Where are you going?
Rembrandt!
What's wrong?
Stop sniffing at the sun, or I'll pee on you.
Don't you believe me?
Lower the paddle!
That's the Westerkerk, the church of 100 bells.
The colours, the accents of Amsterdam.
Where'll you stay?
At a dealer's.
My partner, his name is Uylenburgh.
He'l shift himself on your account.
Rat poison!
Galleons unload their cargoes at our docks.
The riches of the Indies spread out before the eyes of the poor.
Yes, my brothers, if your son is old enough to be tempted send him away from Amsterdam.
The women here sell their bellies without shame, there are lustful monkeys... strange-looking men, they say, couple together.
Stinking pipes are smoked, full of drugs borne in on caravels, accursed herbs culled in Satan's pastures.
They light up brains like the Northern Lights.
You are a painter, you want glory!
Beware the blind, they envy those who know the Light.
Cornelia, my sweet mother, you were not far wrong, Amsterdam turns the head.
Uylenburgh promised instant acclaim.
It came all right, like a friend.
It was snowing.
As sure as my name is Uylenburgh...
I'm pinching myself, but this is no dream!
No one has done this before. This is life in motion, inch by inch, the living thing, caught in a split second.
Do your hear, Paulus?
In Rembrandt's studio work is work.
I know, I know...
The orders are flooding in.
I told you, didn't I?
High society is aching to know you.
The company at Muiden have announced a visit. One of them is here, he wants to meet you.
Can he come in?
No, you can't not.
Hurrah!
I'll fetch him.
This is Master Rembrandt.
Rembrandt, this is the Honourable Jan Six, a great scholar and poet.
I'm no prophet, but I predict a happy future.
You laugh?
Good.
Genius is not meant to laugh.
Genius?
You do me too great an honour.
Don't conceal assurance behind assumed modesty.
I recognize my own pride in yours.
His pride and mine were not of the same sort.
Jan Six' pride bore the tint of his world, the world of Muiden, at the gates of Amsterdam.
Maria Tesselschade whom a burning ember blinded in one eye reigns over Muiden Castle.
Each and everyone of us keeps a watchful eye for rivals who might catch her gaze.
Tell me, Huygens, I hear you're responsible for luring to Amsterdam one Rembrandt Van Rijn.
One Rembrandt Van Rijn!
You must have been on a long journey. Know, Sir, that anyone with a care to novelty and 2 eyes in his head must have noticed him an age ago.
Even I, with only one.
Why have I not seen him here?
He is said to be somewhat exuberant!
So says Six.
They are inseparable.
He says his brush is remarkable.
I said both, it's true.
So he's exuberant. Where's the harm?
A little is charming. A lot is vulgar.
He has 20 pupils already!
All exuberant, probably!
- Look at his shoes!
- I want to see them!
I must see them. - They're like lily-pads.
- With pom-poms!
He looks wealthy!
He must be, to buy a picture for a carpenter's annual wage.
In Rembrandt's studio, work is work and nothing else.
He says so often enough.
They hanged the coat-thief. He is to be dissected tomorrow.
The commission was for next month!
It has been decided otherwise.
Public dissections are rare.
I gather it had to come before the elections. So, Professor Tulp moved the execution forward.
What's wrong with starting a commission early?
What man thinks he has the right to shorten a man's life
by so much as a minute?
Ladies and Gentlemen, Professor Nicolaes Tulp,
Messrs. Matthijs Calkoen,
Jacob de Wit, Jacob Block,
Hartman Hartmansz,
Adrian Slabberaan,
Jacob Koolvelt, Frans Van Lonen. ..
As you see, I make an incision in the arm, after which I'll part the tissue.
You'll see, in this man, whom sin has condemned, the tunnels where flowed an impious blood.
Blood flows throughout the body.
Watch and use this knowledge!
Never get lost in conjecture.
Use this experience and the proof it brings.
We respect proof, such is our rule. The intangible is valid only in religion.
We have been given proof of this criminal's error.
He had sto en another's property.
The equilibrium of society rests on absolute rights of property.
Infringement of this law commands sentences the frivolous consider severe.
They do not admit the law demands respect not because it is right but because it is the law.
Let us return to the lesson this man affords us.
It is his penance that his remains should further the noble cause of knowledge.
Consider the mechanical splendour of this, God's machine,
a more perfect creation than the most perfect creations of our artists.
You seem dissatisfied.
Professor Tulp is not natural, he poses.
It's not in his nature to be natural.
That is his strength.
Your painting is magnificent because you cannot lie.
I know, you're working. There's a girl, my cousin... my cousin Saskia...
Come, Saskia!
She is but recently in Amsterdam, at her guardian Cornelius Sylvius'. The Calvinist preacher, a holy man!
She is an orphan.
We'd like you to paint her.
She is very pretty.
Not that pretty!
That's true.
She's not that pretty!
Well he's not pretty at all!
He's a bit old for me.
Forgive me, I'm only a peasant. I don't have pretty manners to suit a gir of your sort.
Maybe you drink a drop too much beer and gin too!
Me?
!
As to my "sort"...
I'm only the 8th child of a respectable man who came close to bankruptcy, then died.
I did not mean your money. I meant your manners.
They always criticize those!
I can believe that!
You can't stop fidgeting.
Why do you dance about so?
Look at your hair!
This is your tenth visit, see what trouble this is.
I thought you enjoyed seeing me.
In Rembrandt's studio, work is work.
I now give way to our dear, great poet, Joost Van den Vondel who will honour us with a few recent epigrams.
To our great preacher, Cornelius Anslo.
Cornelius' voice Rembrandt wished to paint, keen to express the inexpressible.
But is painting made for this?
Are not words our sole interpreters?
Saskia!
Look to our Master, he will bankrupt himself!
Flinck is worried about your money.
How you smi e at her!
I like Jews!
And Jewesses even more!
Rembrandt!
You make me laugh.
You make me warm.
Shame on you!
A whale, a whale!
A whale is beached on the shore by the port.
My guardian preaches that a beached whale is God's warning.
May God ward us from evil and protect our be oved land.
God save us from the plague!
The whale-oil trade will grow plump!
They measured its member, it's over 8 ft.
An 8 ft prick, what a dream!
Such beauty makes one thirsty. Come.
I, to a tavern! What wil they say?
Will you buy from me?
He's mad!
It's yours.
Thank you.
I shall marry you.
As I thought, Rembrandt is mad.
Rembrandt, the painter?
Quite so, this is Rembrandt the painter.
My husband.
I married her. I married her.
We were married.
For many years, we were one. Were one, were fused into one.
Painting does that.
Huygens!
What's up!
Great god!
I'm furious.
Rubens is so haughty.
He made me wait two years, now he answers. He rejects the Prince's offer.
Three images of the Passion!
The Catholic devil!
I've asked Rembrandt to do it.
This Rembrandt is wel on his way. But is he right for such a subject?
He sees Calvinists, Mennonites, Anabaptists indifferently.
He is fond of Jews. He even has Catholic friends.
And a few barbarians!
Prints by Lucas van Leyden, ast ot of the day.
I'll buy them cheap, I'll sell them at as light profit, that way we'll both benefit.
Starting price: 80 florins.
80 florins on my left. 90!
100!
110!
150!
165!
200!
2 1 0!
400!
For the good of my profession!
400!
400 it is!
Have you paid him for his Passion yet?
Sold at 400!
He's mad!
Marriage has not made you wiser. Reckless bidding is unwelcome.
People will frown on it.
You've put Becker's nose out of joint, and he's a powerful dealer. A slave-trader!
People like him starved the great Lucas to death.
I sense your disapproval. Is it not my money?
That's not the point. Our society...
Your society is not mine.
Our friendship is outside all that.
Why are you not asked to Muiden?
Do you think I wish to attend your gatherings?
Attend, no.
Be asked, yes.
I do think that.
This house is worth ten times the price of a good ordinary one.
Do we not deserve it?
13,000 florins, Rembrandt dear. You're mad.
Such a sum would feed most people to the end of their days.
Uylenburgh told you. He says it's madness.
He's an ass.
Tell him we'll spend as much again to furnish it properly.
Blue mirrors in ebony frames!
And russet tortoise-shell!
Nothing wil be too magnificent for the wife of an artist famed throughout Europe.
And I, I shall adore you into your old age.
Come!
We'll have soft beds hung in bright cloth!
Why?
I am enjoying you.
Heavy burdens are not good in your condition.
No, Fabritius.
Beauty is truth.
It's not to be sought for in the ideal, much better to find it in what's around. In what's about us.
Once more...
- Fabritius!
- Yes, Master!
- Higher!
- Like this?
That's it!
Nobody move.
- What was I saying?
- The idea...
Ah yes. The ideal.
Beware the grand spiritual charge.
It's not sensible to look for God on high.
Where then?
In man's humble flesh.
It is in the thickness of things that I look for God.
There's nothing I hate more than people who think they can jump at his neck.
They do!
They don't see it, the buffoons!
Not even Huygens, though I owe him much.
Nor that ass Uylenburgh who's always in tune with the times.
Listen to me, children, don't give in to them.
Why are you so mean?
Saskia, my beauty, let's celebrate my anger.
- Mind the drawings.
- Hurry.
Our finest apparel!
Boys!
Tidy those papers, there!
We'll swim in gin!
Yes, swim in gin!
Agatha, Janeke, bring lamps!
Who'll play music?
After this child, I'll make you a 1000 more.
After the pealand plum soup... ox-tongue and green-apples.
What about sweets?
Boys!
Out!
Waters break, baby's born.
Get the men away.
Baby's born, husband out!
Go on!
You can see his hair!
Welcome Rombertus!
You don't much like these things here.
Is that not Govaert Flinck?
A delicate artist.
He at least has hastened to join our circle!
If you refer to Rembrandt, you should know he turned down my invitation.
If you're so keen to meet him, why not commission a portrait?
Losing an eye has not deprived me of sight but of the pleasure of being seen.
May I introduce the painter Govaert Flinck?
Your work is most delicate. Unlike your master, Rembrandt's.
Perhaps my master chooses to see the weight of things and not their lightness.
He's dead, Madam.
What world is this where mothers may not bury their dead children?
Tiny children, tiny, dead children.
Time will pass and gently,
very gently, happiness wil return.
Thanks be to forgetfulness, to hope reborn.
Look at poor Vondel, and he's our national poet!
He lives off his late father's business.
Why on earth be a poet?
My son!
Lord knows, he could easily follow the family tradition.
You who are from a poor background, if you hadn't had to paint...
Mother!
And between us, you were too kind to give him those prints for his tragedy.
It was only really tragic for the four unfortunate spectators in that empty house.
Madam, no brush could possibly keep up with your mouth which does not stop moving.
Light of my ife, I want to see you smile.
Do you know, Rembrandt, that our friend Huygens has just pub ished an epigram which barbs you somewhat?
Really?
It refers to his brother's friend's portrait.
He says it's a poor likeliness.
Do you know, Jan Six, why men of letters often misunderstand painting?
They don't realize the visible is a language which owes nothing to words.
In painting, one should observe exactly that... the painting.
How old is the noisy brat?
Nearly four weeks.
Is he your first?
The third.
How old are the others?
Mother!
Please!
They are deceased.
What is this one's name?
We've called her Cornelia, after my mother.
She has fine lungs.
May God hear you, Madam.
Cornelia, aged three weeks, buried this day in August of the year 1640 beside her brother Rombertus and her sister Cornelia, also dead soon after baptism.
Gently, happiness will return.
Thanks be to forgetfulness. Hope reborn...
Hope is a hardy plant.
On these sorry little ruins it gave us the strength to rebuild,
to make life and erase death.
It's a boy!
A tall flame means a long life.
Here is your child. God grant you happiness in him or let him call him soon.
Here is the father's feather-hat.
Captain Frans Banningh Cocq's company, it will be his biggest canvas!
Saskia's fourth has a cheerful voice.
- This is the one.
- I hope to God.
Janeke, let me fondle your sweet bum.
Stop it!
My Titus, my love.
Maybe we should go home.
It might rain.
You're still very tired.
Geertje, you're a spoil-sport.
Geertje, be good. Take the little one.
Come with Geertje.
Come baby. ..
let's let Mummy rest.
She seems sweet and devoted, the trumpeteer's widow.
The trumpeteer's widow?
The new nurse.
She's a trumpeteer's widow.
I'll let you sleep.
What's become of Captain Cocq's company?
It's becoming.
I bequeath to my son, Titus, al my worldly goods.
My husband,
Rembrandt Van Rijn will manage such goods for him
having full enjoyment of them during his lifetime.
If he should remarry, such provisions are null,
in which case...
We can continue tomorrow...
It'l be fine.
In which case
he must entrust 20,000 florins to the Court of Wardship
in our Titus' name.
Saskia, you're barefoot.
What is it?
It's ovely.
Life is beautiful, my Rembrandt.
I don't want to die.
Our babies, our tiny babies. ..
Look after Titus...
I remember when you enjoyed me.
I did ove you, you know.
Cornelia, my sweet mother,
sorrow snapped my brushes.
Brains stewed in the juices of drugs, skulls infested with lustful images, they stagger now
through the fermented syrup of the streets.
Do you know, friends, why time marks me not?
You cheated, rat!
You deafen us with your eunuch's laugh.
I'll flatten your head, your mother'l think you're Dover sole.
Your Government has voted this absurd law which says those apes are freed from slavery as soon as they touch Dutch soil.
You can put up with savages. I can't!
Rather the golden tan of their skin than your flaccid, pink flesh!
Here. This is for you.
For us?
Thank you.
It really looks like us.
Have the monkey.
He's sweet.
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Titus?
- He's asleep.
Geertje Dircx, the finest trumpeteer's widow I know.
The sun is rising.
The little one. ..
Titus...
Obviously, one frowns on a wastre such as him.
- His son is dressed as a prince.
- He and his maid hold carna ...
Margaretha is right. Even his friends comment.
They say Saskia's family claim he has spent her dowry.
I cannot accept that, Miss. Saskia had not a penny.
- Who says?
- She told me herself.
Bravo!
Trickles of bile thicken fast.
I didn't expect such honesty.
Come on. Come....
It suits him.
Well done, Fabritius!
Welcome, your Lordship!
Quite a dandy!
Have you received summons from Muiden?
We must treat him right.
Muiden dictates right and wrong!
See how he looks down on us!
The Prince's death leaves him vulnerable.
This never-ending war has ruined the art market.
And you, my son, who are his patron?
Patron is a big word.
Client.
As my mother insists, I admit, I have another complaint.
What?
I wish he'd reciprocated the enormous esteem in which I held him.
And you?
Pride leads him to ignore what France and Italy teach us.
It's true his palette has got yet darker.
Uylenburgh, his dealer, complains of it.
Too much shadow...
And if you permit, Father, too much paint too!
Shame a genius should choose such low models.
Indeed. And delights in... showing the mark of a garter on women's thighs.
He suckled vulgarity in his milk.
It makes him stolid.
He won't rise above the owly.
Shame a genius chooses such low...
Shut up!
The highest function of art is not to escape this world but help know it better.
Why are you so mean?
They've killed him, Sir.
I found him hanging off the door-knocker.
He's still warm.
Paulus, fetch me fresh canvas.
The life's still in him.
Don't tell Titus, let me.
The cushion.
There!
Fabritius says there's not one primed canvas.
Never mind.
How dare you impose this dead creature?
500 florins, we're paying you!
Go to hell!
You, your money, your dog with its arsehole of a nose.
We should've listened, they told us he was vulgar and dishonest.
Even his dealer, Uylenburgh, has had enough of him.
There's a feast in the Town Hall. Amsterdam is celebrating the peace.
It's a disgrace our Master is not invited.
He's ill, he's not fit for celebration.
Govaert Flinck is there.
Govaert Flinck has sold his sou to that dog Uylenburgh.
The Master is chesty.
We'll bring his blood up.
Take a pinch of gauze, dip it in spirits just there.
Light it at the flame. 634 00:59:12,220 -- 00:59:13,448 And chuck it in. I'll do the rest.
Seven years I've been with him, he's never been ill.
Let's do it.
They suck up well.
The Master's nice and plump.
My word, they're like teats!
See the nipples sucked out.
Who is the brainless bird that mocks a dying man.
Hendrickje Stoffels.
Janeke's gone off to get married.
She's silly but she's pretty.
Now we have to do it all again.
He must like it.
What's the Master doing later?
He's off to buy prints, cloth
and knick-knacks.
They say the Master's naughty.
Who is this "they"?
People your extravagance annoys.
Plenty of them around...
I have loved your son as my own...
As my own.
The ring...
I had thought...
You had thought...
It was an engagement.
Saskia's ring.
Why did you give it to me?
To say thank you.
I'll look after you for the rest of your lfe.
Rembrandt Van Rijn, I shall take nothing from you.
I don't want charity.
I'll drag you through the courts for breach of promise.
Rembrandt Van Rijn, you shall marry me.
You are unhappy and it is I
who wrenches your heart asunder.
Rembrandt Van Rijn, you shall marry me.
I'll drag you through the courts.
A thousand florins is nothing to you, Six, and it saves me.
I'd be doing you no favour.
You must give up these mad sprees.
I agree. But this is a crisis.
Have I not proved my friendship?
Friendship above one's station.
The Town Hall fire is a sign! The past is dead!
Fire purifies.
I am the next Regent.
Think, if you should marry my daughter Margaretha...
She is not attractive... I won't have flattery.
God made her as she is. She has her gifts.
You are not much concerned with issues of love.
Naturally, if you enter our family, you must end any relationship that might jeopardize our standing.
You know he has recently done a portrait of me and I succumbed to the temptation of...
Lending him money. I know.
I know he signed a bill of receipt.
He signed a bill of receipt.
I must warn you that the Elders of our Church frown upon his culpable domestic arrangements with that creature.
What's that under your dress?
Are you ashamed of the little one?
It shows the vigour of my brushwork.
It's a girl, I know. She shall be Cornelia.
Is it the Elders' summons which make you so sad?
This time, I must obey.
Who cares about their excommunicaton?
We shall be with the acrobats, the jugglers and the bankers!
I know you cannot marry me.
If you asked me I'd refuse: You must paint in peace.
But they must not turn from you on my account.
Hendrickje Stoffels, you are a lady.
Me?
Strange to say.
I am nothing but you inside me.
Hendrickje Stoffels, you appear before our Church Council.
You confess to fornication with Rembrandt Van Rijn as his whore.
You shall be punished for it, condemned to do penance and banished from the Lord's Table unless you leave his house and return to your family.
I cannot. He needs me.
He needs me.
To think it took eight years to make this Temple of Solomon!
A wonder of the world!
Seven years and 8m florins!
You too, you've abandoned him.
The lack of his pictures here will prove it even before the Town Hall opened,
Flinck was commissioned to do it all.
Indeed, but...
Flinck's painting eads just where you want it to go!
Built on a thousand piles!
This war'll finish the feeble.
And the luckless.
Vondel's in trouble. They say his son is bankrupting him.
Not to mention lesser fish.
Rembrandt is pressed to pay 8,400 florins, owed these sixteen years for the purchase of his house.
Have you not, just when his affairs are in crisis, sold a bil of receipt for a debt of his?
Was the sum not an insignificant one for Tulp's son-in-law?
Is it true you sold this IOU?
I did.
He did and was right to.
As we talk of your Rembrandt may I say I fully admit my part in that girl's prosecution?
She has given him a child, I hear.
Cornelia, my darling...
See, Titus, when the brush thinks, it makes mistakes.
It must rummage and chop through the mud of a palette, perhaps find life there... caught red-handed in the act of being.
The true story is what's there.
Right there!
This ox is better than the 1640 one.
It was freezing.
The Buschraat strolled us through the hanging carcasses. One of them was swinging...
He told us poor women would haunt the abattoir to favour apprentices in exchange for a steak or two.
Swings of hot meat!
Come in!
This cancels a part of Uylenburgh's debt to the City.
This is about Rembrandt's failure.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, you were signing...
Yes.
I've come, Father, about that.
If the Court of Bankruptcy has precedence over that of Wardship, Rembrandt won't keep his house in his son's name.
It will go. His collections will be dispersed.
It will kil him.
The receiver has ful powers.
You can't cancel Uylenburgh's debts and kill Rembrandt.
Couldn't you?
I wouldn't if I could.
Forgive me, Father.
I'm disappointed, Jan.
You lack conviction.
I did not betray him at your behest. I did so because I saw his genius and he did not allow me any.
I did so because I gave in to society.
He never did that, because...
He mocks the law!
Your laws are unjust because they do not consider man's true condition.
You are a cold-hearted man. I hate you.
I can live with that. It will not affect our relationship.
You are my son-in-law.
He wouldn't listen. That is why I gave him up.
Do not justify yourself, Uylenburgh.
We could have made a fortune!
He is stubborn!
Now his house is for sale, he must go to the suburbs!
I am surprised at your reluctance.
I hope you do not forget that Regent Tulp's cancellation of your debts means you owe the city... Certain favours.
And we are the city!
- I know.
- Quite!
That's all settled.
And public opinion?
Will be pleased to see a fel on punished for ignoring his creditors' interests.
Will the others follow?
The auction will be as we have agreed. It is settled!
In that case... A canvas called "Christ and the Pilgrim from Emmaus", starting price 35 florins.
Quiet!
I request silence!
Let us pursue this Rembrandt sale.
You stink like a Frenchman!
Is your scent to cover the stench of this affair?
Do you know the words that come to mind?
Tally-ho!
Lucas Van Leyden,
Starting price, 15 florins.
20 florins.
25!
40!
45.
These same prints were bought by Rembrandt 25 years ago for 400 florins!
Any further bid?
45 it is.
Sold!
Sold to the Honourable Harmen Becker.
The price is absurd!
A large, ebony-framed mirror, at 25 florins.
40 florins...
For the good of my profession!
40 florins!
Sold!
A spinet, at 35 florins!
35!
35 it is.
Sold!
The spinet is sold to Miss Tulp!
I can't stand it.
So ends the sale of goods belonging to Rembrandt Van Rijn!
3,000 florins for all this!
What'll become of him?
Losing all he's got won't help. They will pursue him to his grave.
The following lots were sold, 70 paintings by Rembrandt Van Rijn, a Miche angelo marble, a Virgin, by Raphael. An old man, by Van Eyck...
Titus Van Rijn...
Eat up, darling.
The rats clean our canals.
Don't tell me I don't know the plague.
Listen, rat-face, I know the plague, my little daughter has just died of it.
Happy resurrection!
He's working!
He must settle immediately.
They've got everything. Look how we live now!
The order concerns future sales.
It's a question of honour!
Yours as well!
Who live in shame under his roof.
- I shall fight for him to work free...
- And go where Beauty calls.
Don't talk thus!
This is serious.
Is Art not serious?
Honour is in jeopardy, Madam!
I'm not Madam!
I am a whore!
So say your laws!
A whore, do you hear?
Let me by, Hendrickje Stoffels!
Hendrickje Van Rijn!
No woman so deserves the name!
Never mind. I must pass!
You have no business here!
Don't make us use force!
Do you know the cost of thwarting the law?
- Leave this house!
- I'll pass, Madam!
By this deed, you transfer your remaining assets and such as you may yet acquire to your partners,
Titus Van Rijn and Hendrickje Stoffels.
This wardship is protection against prosecution.
You shall possess nothing in your own name.
You may, by this deed, ose the respect of society.
I forego that, gladly, if it means I'm free to paint.
From this day 21st December 1660,
Hendrickje Stoffel and Titus Van Rijn become the guardians of Rembrandt Van Rijn.
They must provide his board, and in return he brings a knowledge of art and the commerce of art to his partners.
They'll never forgive you.
Here's proof of worthiness!
Vondel has paid his son's entire debt.
Noble Vonde!
All he had, 40,000 florins.
I heard it this morning. He's made accountant at the Municipal Savings?
Yes. We have awarded him 600 florins per year. A pastor's wage!
Nice aims!
Lord what charity!
True, it's not easy finding yourself on the streets at his age.
I prefer not to remain here.
Hendrickje has puked green phlegm.
She has two black cherries under her armpits.
I wish to retrieve some jewels. Here's the ticket.
Name?
Rembrandt Van Rijn.
My name is
Joost Van den Vondel.
By feeble light, writing is easier than painting.
You are retrieving goods, that's a good sign. I'm delighted.
Good news is always we come in this horrid time of p ague.
To tell you the truth, I wish to pawn this... in order to retrieve this.
These flies are a nuisance. They ruin our light.
One day, I saw the sun set fire to its own whiskers.
I tried to extinguish it with my spit, but I didn't dare.
Sun-daisies... scented
scented... with turpentine.
At night, the Master comes dripping with colour
and ounges across me.
I get all smeared.
The doctor cut into her boils!
I can still hear the screams.
She is delirious.
It hurts less...
Did you see the sun nibbling at the window?
Pass me the mirror.
The flies make me a veil.
Hendrickje...
Long after you left us, Titus, little Cornelia and I often paid you a visit in your place of rest.
I am banned from the pulpit. They fear Truth.
Still, I shall preach it.
Rats crawl and fornicate throughout the slums.
Their stinking fur is infested with vermin that delight in the rags of the poor.
I tell you, it is through the blood of rats that death and plague run wild.
Come down!
The rich preach Virtue and eave the poor to eat with rats.
You, the artist!
Remember me?
I warned you. The blind envy Light.
Quiet, you!
Don't!
"Since my mother died,
my father, the great Rembrandt, is very quiet.
He thinks only of his pictures.
He goes to bed late, hands covered in paint.
In the morning,
Agatha, our old maid who's remained faithful brings my father herrings he dips in gin like sweet biscuits.
My brother was saddened by the death of the madwoman who looked after him as a child.
She spent six years in an asylum at Gouda.
Titus says she was a trumpeteer's widow.
10th February 1668.
Snow.
Titus is marrying his cousin, Magdalena Van Loo.
He shal be a father soon."
"Titus, my brother, my father's beloved son, died of the plague, aged 27, on this 4th September 1 668.
He will not know his child."
"My father wanders round the house, a foolish smile..."
Titus, my son, I was so fearful for you, when you were still being nursed.
Tiny bean... I held you in my arms.
I remember your head resting...
Can I tidy up?
...in the hollow of my hand.
Tidy?
Why?
It was as if I was gauging the exact measure of my affection.
That's it.
As if my arms could hold love itself in swaddling-clothes.
My father is dead!
Rembrandt is dead!
The great Rembrandt!
He died with his eyes open, smiling!
Great Rembrandt has died with his eyes open!
My father is dead!
Great Rembrandt is dead !
To paint thus, one must surely have died more than a few times.
It's cold.
Lotte, Lotte, Lotte.
Catch it, Anna.
~ Dear little sister, dance with me
~ Take both your little hands
~ One time back, one time forth
~ Turn around and then it's done
~ Now give me your right hand ~ And we dance very gallantly
~ One, two, three, quick on your feet
~ Cheerfully we dance around each other
It's time.
I'm not saying that we're any better than you, but really in Thee find eternal happiness.
You have absolutely no right.
I'm family too, aren't I?
They're better off with us.
I'm not trying to be difficult, but...
So many nice things. Music, a big house...
Aren't we good enough? Not posh enough?
Are you any better?
They will have every opportunity with us.
Be honest. Lord, grant the deceased eternal peace.
Let perpetual light shine on him.
Lord, grant him eternal rest.
Amen.
You can have the sick one. Just the sick one. Final offer.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection.
It's a disgrace.
Twins belong together.
Be quiet, Ferdinand. We'll go along with it. Everyone will get something.
Let me go.
Anna.
Lotte.
Anna!
- Anna!
- Lotte!
- Bonjour, Madame.
- Bonjour.
Not bad, eh, Jet?
It turns with the sun.
No Swiss sanatorium could match it.
For you.
For you.
We're going to get Lotte well again.
Lotte is going to be well cared for in her new country.
Go on.
Come.
- When is Lotte coming?
- When you've finished.
Start at the front.
Not all in one go.
Lotte won't be coming. She has consumption.
So that's that.
Look, this is my mummy. She's not alive anymore.
Just like your mummy.
And now I'm your new mummy.
Give me that handkerchief.
You know these words, don't you?
Handkerchief?
Mummy? Say "mummy". They are Dutch words.
Dear Lotte, when are you coming?
- What are you writing?
- A letter. - To whom?
- Lotte.
- And where will you send it to?
Do you know the address?
She thinks we know the address.
No, no, no.
We don't have the address either.
They don't want us to know it. Afraid we'll drop by.
Stuck-up lot.
Maybe Lotte will write to you.
If she's still alive.
Dear Anna.
Tomorrow I will get on the train and come to you.
Tomorrow I will be with you again.
You'll never guess what delicious things I have.
That's good. Write a nice letter to your sister.
Later. After your meal.
Dinand?
We have to decide now.
Do we send it?
And then?
She'll want to go there when she's better. And then they'll keep her.
- I can't bear to see it.
- They're barbarians, Jetje.
Stupid farmers.
Stupid, Catholic farmers. Do you want her to grow up there?
No.
She has to forget Anna.
Believe me, Jetje.
For her own good.
She simply has to forget Anna.
Why is there no letter?
- Harder.
- No.
- Because there won't be a letter.
- Why not? - I'll tell you some day.
Go on. - No.
Lotte doesn't want anything to do with you. She thinks you're stupid and dirty.
And besides, she's dead.
- Anna! - Sweetie... Did something make you call out for Anna?
Shall I tell you about Anna?
You understand me perfectly, don't you? Clever little girl.
Anna is living with the barbarians.
They are really stupid people who have no stationery. And that's why there is never a letter.
But not to worry. Anna is very happy with the barbarians. She likes it there.
And she wants Lotte to be happy, too. Anna doesn't want Lotte to cry.
You have to go to sleep now.
Sleep well.
Sleep well.
- Is she getting milk?
- The milk is to sell.
And why don't I see her in school?
Really?
She doesn't seem that way to me. In fact, she seems rather clever.
What is it?
"The grace of help is a supernatural assistance through which God lightens our understanding and moves us to shun evil and do good."
- I want to go to school.
- You're coming with me.
- Why are you here?
- My hands, you see.
I don't play the piano anymore.
- Both hands?
- Only the right. Arm and hand.
I have everything low in the kitchen. But other than that...
Bonjour, Madame.
We just have to make the best of it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What's wrong with you?
- Arthritis?
- Yes.
Me, too. I have that, too.
- It runs in our family.
- Oh, well. Not in mine.
Yes, it does.
It does.
Why are you looking in the mirror?
Your father had consumption. So did your sister.
And your mother had cancer.
But I'm still alive.
Our Lot has been on the radio twice already.
With a choir.
- It's not about you, you know.
Here comes Schumann.
Third year, conservatory. I'm a rotten player. Go on.
- The farmer who marries you...
- Does not exist.
- Oh no?
- No.
I won't marry a farmer. I won't be a farmer's wife.
You have a beautiful voice.
Are you coming to the conservatory?
No, I'm going to study German.
Pity. Why? Why German?
I think German is a beautiful language.
Are you the milkman's?
You don't look like your sisters at all.
Yet they're sisters all the same.
Imagine.
You're much more beautiful.
Please.
- The axle of our hay cart.
Is it ready? - Not yet.
What are you doing?
- He looks like he wants to fight.
- He does. Fight for us. For all of us.
Against unemployment and against poverty.
That man has big plans for us.
It's incredible that this Hitler, this mudslinger, is so successful.
Germany, Germany...
It's in the papers every day. I'm sick of it.
Our Bram has just returned from Germany.
- Oh really?
- Yes. A born raconteur, my brother.
They said that you had to go to Germany for proper training in violin making.
And?
He was back after fourteen days, devastated.
Why?
Oh, I don't know...
I can listen to him for hours.
- Tell us, go on.
- It's just not easy to get a position there.
For Jews, he means. He was given the cold shoulder everywhere he went.
We're no longer welcome there.
Oh, you shouldn't take those Nazis too seriously, you know.
We belong to the first class.
Did you know that? Farmers belong to the first class.
If he succeeds, everything will be better.
Then you can take on a workman and I can go to school.
- Who gave you this paper?
- Bernd Möller. He told me all this.
Bernd Möller is an idiot.
We are Catholics.
Adolf Hitler is fighting for us. It says so there.
You'll get a workman, I'll go to school.
- Never let me catch you near that boy. - Why?
I only want to go to school.
Never let me catch you near that bastard, you hear me?
So that's how they do it. Enlisting young people.
Idiots. Bunch of sheep. And you're falling for this as well.
Never again, do you hear?
If I ever catch you near that stupid ass...
Let them talk, ignorant farmers.
Your uncle is an ignorant farmer.
Obedient Catholics. They don't know any better.
Like animals who have lived too long in a cage. Open the door and they stay inside.
What has the Church ever done for us?
Do you want to spend the rest of your life in filth?
We'll do it differently.
If there were more women like you, we'd have the new Germany in no time.
You sit here.
- Well, what do you think?
I've joined, Anna. A new order, and I'm part of it.
- You should join as well.
- Yes.
Do you want to make me happy?
- And Germany? And our Fuhrer?
- I want to go to grammar school.
I'll build you a house. With a gable roof. And shutters.
And a solid oak door. I have to go home. They don't know where I am.
Heinrich, come here.
Anna kissed him.
Would you have dared if your father were still alive?
Would you?
Would you have dared if your father were still alive? Come here, you.
Come here.
What's wrong?
Anna.
Separating twins - what an idea.
It's just criminal.
I've written so many letters. Sitting up in my bed.
"Anna, where are you?
Anna, write back. Anna, Anna, Anna."
But she never replied.
I talked to her in my head.
They thought I was a quiet child, but I was talking all day.
- Like this I can see both of you.
- Don't.
But which one is Anna?
Why don't you visit her?
She never gave me a sign she was alive.
Shall I go with you?
I'll go with you.
David, you cannot talk about this.
- We never talk about it at home.
- Why not?
I told you. Now you must forget it again.
That does it. I'm taking you away from here.
~ Dear little sister, dance with me
Take both your little hands
~ One time back, one time forth
That cupboard on Monday morning, I told you.
The outside only.
- And the floor?
- I wanted to do that later.
Come here, girl.
I check everything myself, like this.
There can be no dust, no dirt anywhere.
No rest until all the dirt is gone.
It's a struggle.
Dust plagues our lives.
Don't forget the portrait of our Fuhrer.
~ Now give me your right hand
~ And we dance very gallantly
~ One, two, three, quick on your feet
~ Cheerfully we dance around each other
- I can't find it.
Schumann.
- Higher, I think.
Schumann.
Schumann.
That's not very gentlemanly.
No, it's not.
What is that?
It's cruel.
All those letters.
My sister.
How could you?
Something so terrible.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Where are her letters?
Or did you throw them away?
- No, darling. No.
- Give me those letters then.
No letter ever came.
Why not?
Did she know where I lived?
All that time she was waiting for a letter from me?
Who would do such a thing?
Why? Explain it to me.
We saved you from a bunch of illiterate barbarians.
Why didn't you save her then?
You were sick.
And if you had visited Anna, they would have kept you there.
- Your life wouldn't have been as nice.
- I would have still had my sister.
You would now both be marching behind Mr. Hitler, waving flags.
Does she still live there?
With the barbarians?
Why?
Because I'm going to her.
Good day, madam.
Hereditary Health Department.
Could we have a word? According to our information, you have a servant called Anna Bamberg.
May we come in?
What about Anna Bamberg?
As you know, Anna Bamberg is mentally retarded.
- She looks quite normal, I thought.
- Yes, yes. That's not unusual.
But these papers leave no doubts.
What do you want from her?
You know the government is looking to solve the problem of retarded people?
I don't understand.
It has been decided that Anna Bamberg is to be sterilized.
Sterilized?
Such things are hereditary, madam. Surely you know that.
Anna Bamberg, retarded?
It's right here in the guardianship deed.
"Anna Bamberg, foster daughter of Heinrich and Martha, is retarded and too delicate of health to be educated."
"She is so weak..."
That they had to keep her home from school. And so on.
Read for yourself.
He was paid?
She's right in front of you, Anna Bamberg.
I'm that delicate, retarded girl.
I could read and write when I was six years old.
My uncle kept me home to work for him for free.
He allowed his wife to terrorize me, he beat me up. And no one... No one ever came to check whether what he'd written was true.
And now you're going to sterilize me?
I've had quite enough of this.
Out.
- Excuse us.
- Get out.
Don't you worry. I won't break any more of your vases.
You know what your problem is?
You have ideas above your station.
- Good luck.
- You're a servant and you always will be.
My dear sister.
This is my first letter to you, but also my hundredth.
I'm writing this with thumping heart, because I think, dear Anna, that we will see each other again soon.
I have found you.
So you're still alive.
Lotte... What a surprise.
I've asked myself so often why you didn't write.
We were both lied to.
Your letter took five weeks to get here.
Dear Anna, do you know where you're going yet?
I'm tutoring in German. I have nearly enough for the trip.
Will you write to me?
Dear Lotte. Your letter came yesterday, after eight weeks.
It was opened at Customs.
I have a new position, near Cologne, with a countess.
We live in a villa with a swimming pool. Can you imagine?
The countess is beautiful. And she smells so nice, of powder and cigarettes.
Are you coming soon?
I've gone ahead and bought one.
Anna. Do you remember me?
Everything-
Your eyebrows... Everything. Your eyes.
Daddy's eyes.
This car belongs to the countess.
Everyone else's cars are commandeered.
Nice car.
You can only stay one night.
I couldn't reach you. Everything has changed again.
We're heading east. The countess is afraid. Afraid that the English will start bombing us.
Thank you, Gunther.
There she is.
Charlotte von Garlitz Dublow, Countess of Falkenau.
They have an old castle on the Oder.
That's where we're going.
Beautiful, isn't she?
- Is this all right?
- Yes. Yes.
When do you have to leave?
Tomorrow morning.
The countess can't do without me.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes. Pity. The war...
I have to go downstairs.
What about me?
Can I come? I'll help you.
Why not? You'll find out what a proper maid's life is like.
You're like a board. As straight as an arrow.
- Thanks.
- Not too tight?
- Why are they here?
- They're on leave. Guests of the count.
Come on.
I don't know what it's like there or how long we'll stay.
It's mad. We're taking everything with us.
The whole family is dining here. Plus spouses and children.
The officers, the guests...
Let me think. Who is sewing?
- We used to have the same glasses.
- Hannele and I. And Lotte.
Hermann will pour the wine.
Did we have crystal?
No, in Holland. At my mother and father's house.
Anna, the silverware. We can't find it. Has it been packed?
Madam, this is my sister.
Not now, darling. Silverware. Come, rescue me.
What's it like, university?
Oh, nice. But I don't study enough.
I much prefer singing.
I've got an accompanist at the moment.
I can play, but he's much better.
Do you still play the piano?
A very nice boy.
Do you want to know a secret?
We're going to get engaged.
Anna, dear Anna. What would I do without you?
Engaged? Really?
Tell me about it.
When are you finished?
Is it the champagne, or are there more maids here?
~ Jews live shamelessly in our German fatherland
~ Soldiers, comrades, put the Jews against the wall
~ When the soldier goes into battle he is in high spirits
~ With the Jew's blood dripping from his knife, things look even better
~ For we are going into battle
~ For we are going into battle
~ Against England, England
Our side has suffered the first casualty.
This is the hardest I've ever worked.
Do you want to stay here?
Why?
You can come with me to Holland.
There is no war there.
And I'm sure my... my mother would be pleased.
Go with you to Holland?
I don't have anything for you.
That many?
You don't have to read them now. Silly children's letters.
If I had received all those letters...
Remember this?
Mum's.
Now you can have it for a while.
She couldn't embroider.
What are they doing?
- Why are they doing that?
- They've gone mad.
Anna, you have to leave. You can't stay here.
Come with me. Come with me to Holland.
Please.
Why not?
I can't abandon the countess right now.
Two weeks. Three, at the most. Until we settle in there.
Then I'll come. Two weeks... I don't understand.
Until we've settled in. Then I'll come.
Why can't you decide for yourself?
Forty-five rooms.
She doesn't know what to do. It's not up to that woman. It's your life.
Three weeks. Then I'll come.
I promise. I want to meet everybody. Your sisters.
Want to see him?
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.
- What was it?
- For a moment I thought he was a Jew.
Madam?
If you want me to take you to the station, you'd better come now.
Safe journey.
See you soon.
Bye.
Bye, Lotte.
Bye, Lotte.
Bye.
Everyone is waiting for you.
Lotte. Lotte, come. Please, Lotte.
This endless running... I'm old.
Then don't.
I didn't ask you to run after me.
- I'm your sister. I'm alive, I exist. - I didn't ask you for anything.
- I've looked for you, I've telephoned.
- Telephoned?
Yes, telephoned. I asked for you. And then she doesn't know who I am.
- Who?
- Your daughter.
- Did you call Hester? - Yes. I said:
Anna. Nothing. Anna Grosalie.
Nothing. Anna Bamberg.
Nothing.
- She must have thought I was crazy.
- Bother my daughter?
How dare you?
All this time you pretended that I didn't exist.
But I'm alive, and I want to talk to you.
Why are you bothering me?
You were gone.
Why didn't you stay away?
Why didn't you tell anyone about me?
What should I have told my children?
Were you ashamed of me?
- I'll walk with you and we will talk.
- I don't want to talk.
Then I'll talk.
I can't hear anything.
My God, what a pigsty.
Forty-five rooms.
You have to help me.
The emperor Wilhelm slept here.
You can still smell him.
Stuffy and sour.
I'd like to go to Holland in two weeks, to visit my sister.
Is that all right? Of course not.
The rooms, I don't know where everything is. The linen and suchlike.
But after that I want to go to visit my sister.
Darling, that's impossible. Then we have to get the cellars ready for the Poles.
- Which Poles?
- Forced labor.
Coming to replace our workers, who have to fight in Poland.
Funny, isn't it?
She's an anti-Semite.
Don't be silly. Just because she thought I was a Jew?
Yes.
You want to know something? I am a Jew. I look like three Jews put together.
So bring your sister over.
I won't have anything to do with that whole German thing.
And I'm giving up my studies, too.
Considering the circumstances, I think it's better if you don't come here.
Your country is at war. Better not.
Anna. We're going. Are you coming?
Something wrong with your sister?
I have no sister.
Do you want to dance?
Are you all right?
- Come, drink.
- No, no.
How about you?
I'm so hot, so terribly hot. Are my cheeks really red?
Will you be staying long?
Yes.
Come.
Why does she say that? "Better not." Better for whom?
- Who said that?
- Lotte.
- First I had to come, and now I can't.
- Lotte. Is that the fat woman?
- My sister in Holland.
The letter. - Oh, your sister.
- Why not, all of a sudden?
- Why not what?
What have I done wrong? I only want to go to her.
To Holland?
- We're twin sisters.
- Yes, twins.
We had one of those in Czechoslovakia. A non-commissioned artillery officer.
I won't write back. "Better not." I've done without her all my life.
Seriously?
You were in Czechoslovakia?
Do you look alike?
My sister knows all about music. She's a wonderful singer. Songs by...
I don't know who. With a pianist, that's her fiancé.
Can you sing?
Me neither.
She studies at a university. German. My sister.
She teaches, too. Speaks really good German, better than me. So clever...
And her eyes...
- The way she sometimes looks...
- What way is that?
Exactly like our father. Then she doesn't need to say anything.
I could see her thinking.
And looking.
Why would she do that?
It's clean.
She's German herself.
What a nice handkerchief.
It's good that you've got a handkerchief like that with you.
- Maybe she thinks I'm stupid.
- Stupid? You?
Impossible. Out of the question.
I'm on to you, you Ostmarker.
Or should I say Austrian?
Since you're with us now.
Now it's dirty.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
Austrians. They're those operetta soldiers, aren't they?
With roses in their rifles.
I'm a conscript.
If I had a choice, I'd be at home in Vienna. With a rose in my rifle.
- See you tomorrow. - Bye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Good?
- Yes.
What's this I hear?
What have you done?
Did you lend the beet press to the Poles?
Otherwise they have to do it by hand.
Silly goose. You don't think they'd do the same for us, do you?
- They hate us.
- But we don't hate them.
They are subhuman. We are the master race.
Shouldn't we lend them the beet press, if we are the master race?
Go ahead, then. You do what you want anyway. Bolshevik.
- Come.
- What is it?
Listen carefully. I wanted to see you.
I'm not allowed to leave the barracks, so I climbed over the wall.
- It's a secret. We're marching off.
- Where to?
I don't have time. I have to go back. If they find out...
I just wanted to see you.
Where to?
I have to go back. All leave has been canceled.
We're off, Anna. Oh, my dearest. I'll write.
Will you wait for me?
When are you coming back?
Why has all leave suddenly been canceled?
My people. Despite having maintained strict neutrality during the past months, our country was attacked last night, suddenly and without warning, by the German Wehrmacht, despite their solemn promise that our neutrality would be respected as long as we maintained it ourselves.
Who do they think they are? Bloody Huns.
Let's go.
- To do what? - Sailing.
Today?
It's war.
- People are advised not to go out.
- We're going anyway.
Lotte, hold on.
We said we would wait.
- First we get married.
That's the deal. - I don't want to wait any longer.
Stop.
Why don't you want to wait?
David!
- You're mad.
- No, I'm very serious.
- We could be dead tomorrow.
- Seriously.
I don't know.
Forget it.
Forget everything. Forget me. What does it matter?
- What's wrong with you?
- And we're not getting married either.
Don't be stupid.
Here.
I'm breaking it off.
OK?
Then don't. All the same to me.
- Can we go back? - No.
Come on, I want to go now.
- Go on, then.
- Come.
Don't forget the peak halyard.
David, come on.
No.
- I'm going.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What's the matter, silly rabbit?
- Why don't you break it off?
- Why should I?
Because I'm German, of course.
I'm German.
You know how it is. All those refugees... The way Germans think about Jews...
And now they're here.
It's war. I'm German, and you'll hate me.
To me you're Lotte. The girl I love so much. The girl who sings so beautifully.
- Who is German. - And who thinks she can sail.
We're Lotte and David, and politics have nothing to do with it.
Lotte, don't.
I've come for Martin Grosalie. His training is done.
Leave has been canceled.
What?
- They're being punished.
- What for? They were almost done. All they had to do was shout "Sieg Heil".
Brand-new SS officers. Shouldn't be a problem.
The commanding officer didn't think it sounded enthusiastic enough.
Do you understand?
Poland, Russia. Fighting, fighting...
He's been trying to get leave for two years.
It was the only reason he wanted to do this stupid training.
Do you think he really wanted to be an officer?
He doesn't give a damn about the whole war.
- Sieg... - Heil!
At least you can't throw that one in the water.
David, I want to become a Jew.
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.
- I want to convert.
- You'd be mad.
Why?
Because of the situation?
No, because of all the fuss.
My silly rabbit.
My bag. I forgot my bag.
- Where?
- In the cafe. The train tickets, everything.
- You'll never make it. Seven minutes.
- Easily.
David!
- I'm your silly rabbit.
- And don't you forget it.
Buchenwald?
Buchenwald, Buchenwald.
- What is there, Buchenwald?
- A sort of work camp, for young men.
"I'm doing fine. We're working hard.
David."
In German.
What is the charge?
Is there a charge?
No, no. We think the Germans wanted to set an example.
After the strike in Amsterdam.
"Watch out, don't make trouble."
He's not so badly off there. He's healthy. He's always practiced sports.
It could easily last a few months, though.
Strange how things go, isn't it? If you hadn't forgotten your bag...
Shall I make tea?
Please forgive me, Anna, for not contacting you for so long.
We're all confused here.
But I think about you a lot, and I need you.
I'm scared, Anna. Help me.
David has been taken to Buchenwald.
It's my own fault.
Do you know what's in Buchenwald?
Tell me.
We're getting married, if I want to.
And I want to.
Anna.
Sweet, dear Anna.
- He wants me in Vienna. He has leave.
- How can he have leave now?
"Got tired.
Russia too big.
Eight days too late for Stalingrad."
"Official leave. Come to Vienna.
Get married, if you want.
Martin."
I don't understand, but I want to. I want to.
Good luck.
Goodbye.
Anna. Goodbye, Anna.
Anna, wait.
Anna, wait. From Holland. From your sister.
Just for a few months, of course.
But of course. I think it will be a lot of fun.
Don't you, Dinand?
We'll pay all the expenses. Have I made that clear?
Yes, yes.
Plenty of space now that the girls have left home. Such lovely little rooms.
- Until we find a definite solution.
- Jet's room... Dad.
- Is it all right?
- Oh, did I not make that clear?
Of course it is. It's our humane duty.
Welcome.
From David.
"If I don't get my sailboat soon, it will be too late.
David."
- He's asking for help.
- Auschwitz. Now it's Auschwitz.
My darling, my sweet. I want to go to him.
Mother.
Just for once, let me be alone... in this stupid house.
Welcome home, Mr. and Mrs. Grosalie.
Did it hurt?
It hurt terribly.
Did you cry?
I'm a man.
Oh, my hero.
Don't worry. I'm with the signals unit. They're not in any danger.
Goodbye.
What's this supposed to be?
What is this?
Mash?
Looks more and more like water.
Is that it? Do I not get any more?
Never mind, then.
I'm so nervous. I hope I recognize him.
- As long as he recognizes you.
- I'm sure he will.
The girls.
Martin.
Martin.
- They say it's almost over.
- The Russians are at West Prussia.
Maybe you won't have to go back.
Then we'll go back to Vienna.
Don't look.
Now. It's a bit premature, but I don't have much to do at your parents'.
That's what I want.
A baby. As long as I have a lot.
A big family. On Sundays we'll go for walks.
Will you come?
Actually, I'd like a girl first. I don't know why.
Now I know what I really want. Twins. Two girls.
And they'll always stay together.
- Gas?
- Yes, gas.
What kind of sick idea is that?
It was in the paper. I'm not making it up.
What was in the paper?
Something about shower rooms, where the enemy prisoners, it said, were driven in naked and gassed.
- And that the capacity of the chambers has been raised...
from 200 to 1,000 people per day. - Of course that isn't true.
- Are you calling me a liar?
There's mail?
There hasn't been a letter for a long time.
There is mail.
"Dear Frau Grosalie."
"it is my duty as company commander to inform you of your husband's heroic death."
In the Eiffel. Shellfire.
"Certain of our victory, and our rightful cause, I remain..."
"Your husband's heroic death."
They swept him together and buried him in that village.
At least you had a grave.
There was no cemetery in Auschwitz.
Father?
Do you know where Lotte is?
Lotte!
Lotte, are you coming?
Everyone's going. Are you coming?
I want to see the Canadians. We don't want to be late.
Do you think David will still want me?
I don't think David is coming back.
And I think... that you think that, too.
Are you awake?
My little girl.
An official notice about David.
Do you want to read it?
Well, what it boils down to... It's what we already suspected.
In Auschwitz.
What we suspected.
My little bunny rabbit.
Can I help you?
Yes. Could you tell me where... Damn, a bloody Hun.
Lotte.
You have a baby.
I didn't know that.
Never again.
Start a fight, curse her, hit her, I don't know, but do something. This is terrible.
You have to talk to her. Get over it.
She can't help it.
And you don't know anything about her.
They're not all Nazis.
Talk to her. You'll find out.
She's family, Lotte. Your twin sister, for God's sake.
Lotte, please.
Lotte.
Come.
All glued together. For the sound.
I came for her.
She's the only one I have left.
Get out.
Get out of my house, Nazi.
Nazi. You killed him. You and that man.
Do you want an SS whore in your home?
Get out.
Get out of my life. I never want to see you again.
You're not my sister anymore.
So that's what it was.
Your twin sister, the wife of an SS officer.
And now you speak Dutch.
Good, eh?
I thought: I won't let that happen to me twice.
We should get back. It's getting late.
I hardly knew what was happening in Holland.
And about what happened to the Jews we didn't find out until much later.
"We didn't know."
Yes. - We didn't know.
- We have to get back.
If I'd had TB instead of you, our roles would have been reversed.
But would I have made the same choices?
Of course. You wouldn't have known any better, just like me.
I would never have married an SS officer.
I didn't fall in love with an SS officer, but with Martin, the best man in the whole world.
I would never have fallen in love with a murderer.
Martin was no murderer.
Where are we, for God's sake?
We've both been victims of circumstance.
Sorry, but I'm not going to compare my life to yours.
Why not?
Is my sorrow worth any less than yours?
Damn it, Lotte. If you and I can't understand each other, then who can?
- What will happen to the world?
- Shut up. I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to understand. By forgiving you I'd betray David.
You don't have to forgive me. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I haven't done anything wrong.
I've always tried to do the right thing and you're treating me like a monster.
- I didn't kill David.
- Oh, stop it, Anna.
You and I live in two different worlds. They can never, ever meet.
I'm going this way. You go back. I'll find another route.
Hold on.
- We'll climb down slowly.
- Yes.
"The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Well, there we are.
Dinner can be served here, as far as I'm concerned.
Lotte, I didn't kill David.
I know that.
But you feel I'm responsible.
I'm not really sure that I do.
The very last one.
Lovely. A feast.
- Do you have any children?
I couldn't have any, thanks to Uncle Heinrich's beatings.
I later got a job with the Child Welfare Council.
That's where I worked for the rest of my life. And I really enjoyed it.
Little Anna.
I'm so cold, so cold.
I understand.
She knew that she...
She wanted me... for me to... before she...
- That's what it was.
- Madam.
I understand.
Who is this woman?
Anna. My sister.
My twin sister.
Johan became a multimillionaire in his old age.
An old Danish aunt... who had been a renowned opera singer... left him a fortune.
Once he became financially independent, he left the university.
He bought his grandparents' summer house. A run-down chalet in an isolated area near Orsa.
Johan and I haven't had any contact with each other for many years.
Our daughters are far away, even from me.
Martha lives in a home, sinking in the isolation of her illness.
I visit her now and then, but she doesn't recognize me.
And Sarah...
Sarah married a successful lawyer... and then moved to Australia where they have very good jobs.
They don't have any children.
Me?
I still practice my profession, but at the pace I choose.
Family quarrels and divorces mostly.
I've been thinking I should visit Johan.
ONE Marianne carries out her plan
I've been thinking... I should visit Johan.
And now I'm here.
He's sitting there, at the porch. And I've been standing here, watching him and... waiting, at least ten minutes.
Maybe I should have ignored this irrational impulse.
This trip. In fact, I'm not an impulsive person at all.
But here I am... And so I must decide:
Slowly return to my car... or get close to him.
Of course, I could stay here a while longer... and let my confusion abate.
But not very long. A minute more!
This minute is taking its time.
33 seconds... 47 seconds...
55 seconds...
No!
- Did I wake you?
- It's you, Marianne.
- Hi!
- No, don't get up.
- Typical, you were spying on me.
- That's not true.
We haven't seen each other in 30 years. 32 years!
- We simply lost track of each other.
- That's natural. People start together, then they separate and talk by phone...
- and finally silence.
- So sad! - ¿Was that a reproach?
- No, we had nothing to say to each other.
Then suddenly you call me and tell me you want to visit.
- You didn't sound very keen.
- Keen? I said no.
I still say no. I don't want this. No.
But you don't care. - I had to come.
- Why?
- I won't tell you.
- You're laughing.
Johan...
I've driven 340 km.... and managed to find your hideout... in the middle of the jungle.
Now that I've seen and kissed you and we've spoken I can leave.
That won't be enough.
Really?
- At least you can stay over for dinner.
A week ago, I told Mrs. Nilsson... that my ex wife was coming to visit.
I can't tell her suddenly that there'll be no dinner. She'll go crazy.
- Who's Mrs. Nilsson?
- Agda. Agda Nilsson.
Are you and her a couple?
God forbid!
The two of you live all alone here in the midst of a dark forest?
Mrs. Nilsson lives in the village.
She cleans and cooks and then goes home.
- She's religious and mean.
- There's no romance then.
To be honest, I fear the hag.
I fear that she might want to marry me.
Anyway, stay for dinner.
She's made up the guest room, so you have to stay and spend the night.
I suppose I better accept.
It's so hard to get up from this chair.
No, don't help me.
What's wrong, Johan?
I'm trying to put my arms around you.
Want to hug me?
Damn, Johan!
Old idiot!
- And how old are you?
- I don't know, and you?
- 86.
- No, not you, me!
Around 55.
- I'm 63.
- Really?
That many?
And I've had my uterus and ovaries removed.
- Does that trouble you?
- Yes, sometimes.
Let's sit on the bench.
It's so beautiful!
When beauty is revealed... in life, in creation... Where is the source, the giver?
Beauty forever.
- I didn't know you knew some psalms.
- My grandmother taught me.
And my grandfather rewarded me with little iron soldiers.
We can enjoy the view, - hold hands...
- Are we going to hold hands?
- Didn't we used to do it?
- Yes, I believe so.
I haven't done it since...
I've stopped doing it.
You really have a beautiful view.
Can you see the lake house from here?
You can see the light reflected, behind the rocks.
I drove by the lake house coming here.
It looks inhabited.
You could say that.
Henrik is there.
Yes, Henrik.
Mi dear son. The assistant professor.
- Are you on speaking terms?
- Not exactly.
I got a brief letter declaring that he was planning on moving there.
He and his daughter Karin have been there since late April.
You don't have much contact then.
Absolutely. A cordial conversation if we run across each other.
- Fat boy Henrik!
He must be... - 61 !
- My God!
- You can say that again!
- And his daughter Karin?
- Karin is 19.
Her mother died of cancer two years ago.
- Anna...
- Tell me.
Anna and Henrik were married for 20 years.
He couldn't take her death. He retired before his time.
I heard they were happy to get rid of him.
He felt mistreated there.
- Like you, at that age.
- Me? No...
Well, yes, I was a bit fed up with the academic standards silliness.
My honorary doctorate from the University of Michigan... finished all that.
- We were talking about Henrik.
He directs an orchestra called "Uppsala Chamber Soloists". But he'll quit that also.
He must do something.
I think he's writing a book.
- What about the daughter?
Karin? - Karin also plays the cello.
She'll audition for the conservatory in the fall.
Henrik is teaching her.
They sit in the house with their cellos every day.
You could say she's beautiful. Like her mother.
Yes. So...
I know nothing about our daughters.
- Sarah is in Australia.
- Australia? !
- Yes, Australia.
- Well, she managed to get far away.
I get letters and phone calls from her.
She's fine. A good law firm.
A good husband. - Sarah's happy with her life. - And poor Martha?
Martha's sinking further and further.
She didn't recognize me.
She's no longer aware, in our sense, of the world.
I understand... - And you?
- I can't complain.
Though sometimes, I see myself in voluntary isolation... and I think I'm in hell. Like I'm dead, but I don't know about it.
But I'm fine.
I've plagiarized my past now that I have the page of answers.
Doesn't sound like fun.
That's it, Marianne. It's not.
And who the hell said that damnation would be fun?
- What does your "page of answers say"?
- Want to know?
- I asked the question, didn't I?
- It says my life was shit.
A stupid and totally senseless life.
Is our marriage part of your hell?
- To be honest, yes.
- I'm sorry to hear that. An old priest once told me:
"A good relationship has two elements:
a good friendship and an unshakeable eroticism".
Nobody can say that we weren't good friends.
- Good friends.
- Of course.
- You were unfaithful.
- I...
- I was too.
- It's so sad.
- But it was long ago.
- It's still painful.
- Not for me.
No, I suppose not.
- Dearest Marianne.
- That's what you say.
Yes, it's what I say. It's nice to be here with you. Holding hands, Watching the beautiful view.
- Without talking about painful things. - You're holding my hand.
Dinner!
Mrs. Nilsson will be furious if we're late.
Johan, I need to wash up and get my bag from the car.
This was a mistake!
TWO Nearly a week has passed
Are you Karin?
Do you want to speak to your grandfather?
Your grandfather and Mrs. Nilsson went to the dentist.
I'm Marianne.
I was your granddad's wife. I'm visiting.
- I know.
- Come on, sit down.
If you want, you can help me clean out these mushrooms.
Here's a knife.
If you want to talk, we'll talk. If not, we can just be together.
You must know Henrik, my dad.
Can't say I do. I've just greeted him, but I don't know him.
- Mom is dead.
- I know.
- She died two years ago.
- Your granddad told me.
- Dad retired and is spending his time with music now.
- The cello, right?
He's writing about St John's Passion.
- You also play the cello?
- I hope to get into the conservatory.
- Your father is the teacher and you are the student.
What's wrong?
Do you know Hindemith's cello sonata, opus 25?
I don't know anything about music.
Dad wants me to play it for the audition.
- It's too hard!
- And doesn't he think so?
How were you in the days before your period?
A premenstrual monster.
I would go to sleep as an angel, and wake up as a demon.
My mind gets shattered. And it's very hard for me to get up.
Dad is a morning person.
And I yawned. We were working on the fourth movement.
That damned Hindemith wrote:
"Lebhafte Viertel ohne jeden Audsdruck und stets Pianissimo"
- You know?
- It looks difficult anyhow.
So I sat there with my shattered mind and I tried.
I begged him to let me off the hook, to no avail.
He made me play the same part at least twenty times!
Finally I said. quietly:
"I don't give a damn about this".
I said that it wasn't a class, it was animal torture.
Henrik was also angry, but he laughed and said that I should... try from the beginning, where it says:
"Lebhaft, sehr markiert... mit festen Bogenstrichen."
I was so angry that I couldn't. He said I was doing it on purpose.
I said that he didn't have the skills to teach: I was unfair.
Dad is the most patient, sensitive and courteous teacher there is.
He said it had nothing to do with the teaching, but rather with willpower and discipline... and that I was lazy.
That I was lazy!
Then I got up and left the cello because I was trembling.
I said that it was enough for the day and that I was going out for a walk.
He turned pale.
I'd never seen him like that.
And he said: "You're not leaving".
I put my boots on and headed for the door.
I didn't hear him approach, but he grabbed me by the shoulders...
You're not leaving!
I sat and cried.
And I said: "Never again, never again, ...never again".
And kept crying until I felt empty.
Then I thought of coming over to see granddad and begging him to help me... leave that lunatic.
It was too much for me.
Now the old man can take care of his crazy son:
send him to the farm, go to the police... or kill him.
Then I became aware that from now on, I know nothing.
I know nothing about my life, what I'll do or become.
Then I realized that mom is dead, and I can't ask her anything.
I was overcome with sorrow for myself and cried again.
You must think I'm a very nervous person, but I'm not.
- Do you think Henrik is suicidal?
- If he'd kill himself?
In an extreme situation like the one you're describing... could he hurt himself?
You know, to be honest, I don't know my father very well.
I only know that deep inside he's... good.
If not, mom never...
Mom loved him, you know? They loved each other.
And I suppose I was out of that love.
That's what I think when I'm feeling sorry for myself and I get tired of my boyfriends.
Why can't I feel love like mom did?
Were you afraid your dad would kill himself after her death?
I never gave his tragedy much thought.
But I tried to take care of mom, as much as he'd let me.
Mom was never very talkative.
But on one of her last days...
She was always drowsy from the morphine... On one of her last days, I was sitting beside her, she looked at me and said clearly:
"You know I love you".
"You know I love you, Karin".
My mother never spoke that way.
Dad once said as a joke, this was a long time ago,
"Anna never says I love you, but her actions are always full of love".
- What if grandfather comes back?
- It's OK, I've got another bottle.
- Were you really married to grandpa?
- Is that so strange?
It's hard to imagine it.
What kind of person is he?
Good question.
- Did you love him?
- I've asked myself the same question all my life.
- Was he so difficult?
- We were married for 16 years.
Then we got divorced.
He had met another woman, an idiot named Paula.
I got married again to a boring glider pilot.
One day, he just flew away.
They never found him.
For some reason, Johan and I got together several times.
Then I found out he was servicing... another lady, a real whore.
I was angry and hurt and finished with him.
I suddenly realized, that I was the most cheated on wife and lover in the world.
Johan was remarkably and compulsively unfaithful.
- You mean that my grand father -...was a real liar.
And he used to write poems.
A volume got published, but it wasn't successful.
- My grandfather used to write verses?
- Yes, even love poems for me.
- Did you keep them?
- No.
But did you love him?
I was terribly naive.
Nowadays, I suppose it's just not possible to be so, so childish... and so know-it-all like I was.
I think I loved him.
Utterly.
- You never suspected?
- Not for an instant.
- What made you come here suddenly?
- I don't know.
You still love him!
Don't you?
If you had to be honest, Marianne...
I hear people say Johan is this or that, not very kind things usually.
But I don't know the Johan they're talking about.
I always thought he was a good man. Very, very good.
It was so easy to hurt him, he could never defend himself.
I believe that Johan... is a moving person.
He's moving.
- Are you crying?
- Yes, a little.
Are you crying for granddad?
- I'm crying for Johan and Marianne.
- I understand.
This is strange.
Dear...
- What will you do?
- Return to Henrik.
- Is that intelligent?
- It has nothing to do with that.
I'll stay here a few more days. Let me know what happens.
I will.
THREE About Anna
It can't happen again.
- Never again.
- Never.
We must have a serious talk.
We both know how things are. There's nothing to sort out.
I'm glad it's so simple!
I was scared to death.
There's no other way to put it:
I was scared to death.
- Do you understand?
- I'm very tired. I'm going to sleep.
- Are you asleep?
Once I had a similar situation with Anna.
We weren't married yet, but we lived together.
Maybe I was a little drunk. I said nasty things about... the damned university, my colleagues, our work environment.
And then about my father, that old bastard.
Anna didn't say a word. And that upset me even more.
I remember thinking...
"What's on Anna's mind, while she's sewing that skirt?"
"What's she thinking? Maybe that Henrik is unbearable".
And then she said it.
"When you're like this, I start thinking that you're not the man I planned to marry".
Then she went to the living room and started to pack.
I tried to stop her. She didn't move... but a message got through from her body to mine.
It said "I'm leaving...
I'm leaving you". Then I said, with a voice that was foreign to me: "Nobody leaves me".
"Nobody leaves me"
"Nobody turns his back on me and leaves... ".
I sat on the floor and thought: "It's over".
I shut my eyes and thought:
"Anna's leaving and she won't return".
But then I heard her going around the kitchen. She was making coffee.
But she didn't say a word. Maybe she wanted to sober me up.
She didn't say anything for the rest of the evening: just kept on sewing.
Anna was the silent type anyway, she never spoke much.
But we didn't need to speak; we always knew...
I begged her to forgive me.
Like a child to his mother:
"I won't do it again".
It's just what I want to say to you, but it sounds ridiculous.
Anyone can say "I'm sorry", but it's meaningless.
So no further words were spoken that night.
It became a... distant night.
Anna sunk into a deep sleep:
I stayed awake listening to her breathing.
I watched her, a street light shone through the window. I gazed at her for a long time and wondered if she really knew... how much I loved her.
Between Anna and me it was a question of belonging, if you know what I mean.
An ownership that was...
a miracle. I know it sounds fatuous. There's no better word.
I fell asleep as dawn approached, and when the alarm clock rang, we got up, had breakfast and chatted as usual.
I went to a class and Anna went to the library.
This is an explanation: not an excuse.
I have no excuses.
If you leave me... I'll be ruined, or some other word that doesn't exist.
In due time, you'll have your freedom. You'll go to the conservatory... With professional teachers and a different life.
It'll be different for me also.
These months with you have been "a state of grace".
For me, that is, not for you.
It was kind of you to return so soon.
I don't know what to say.
It's all so complicated.
We don't have to speak about that.
Sometimes I feel a great punishment awaits me.
FOUR
About a week later, Henrik visits his father.
"Kierkegaard, S. Or A Fragment of Life"
- Am I interrupting?
- Oh, so it's you.
It's been a long time.
- How are you?
- Well, thank you, and you?
At 60 there's 6 things wrong with you, at 70, 7 and so on.
It's a good evaluation:
Of course, it depends on your priorities.
- I heard about your ex wife's unexpected visit.
- Typical Marianne.
She's always known I hate improvisation.
- Maybe I can see her.
- She's gathering strawberries.
I don't know if you'll be here when she returns.
- I don't mean to disturb you.
- Thanks for being considerate.
What do you want?
I need 890,000 kroner.
An advance on my inheritance.
- You need money again.
- I know, I owe you 200,000.
- That you haven't even begun to pay back.
- Don't worry, I'll pay it back.
I'm sure I'll never see that money again.
It's funny to consider it a "loan".
If humiliating me amuses you, let's not forget... I'm not paying rent on the lake house.
We've been there for five months and you haven't seen a cent.
But you were able to buy a new car.
It's a loan. The owner is away.
When he returns in October, I'll be without a car.
- How's the book going?
- Well, thank you.
That's a thorough answer.
I've been here ten minutes, letting you humiliate me. If I didn't need the money, I'd have left long ago.
You can leave now.
It's not for me.
It's for Karin.
I see... Marianne told me you two argued.
Are you trying to make her stay?
Do you think she'll accept a bribe?
I wonder how Anna was able to stand you.
Don't bring Anna into this.
Don't you dare mention Anna with that mouth.
I like you more or dislike you less when you use that tone.
There's a healthy dose of hate in your banalities.
It's like this:
There's a cello I can buy Karin;
an 1815 Fagnola.
It's an excellent instrument, almost like a Guarneri.
Karin has a special talent, she could become a great musician.
I took care of her instruction, but her talent calls for more. Like her cello.
Her German cello is passable, but she'll audition for the conservatory.
Are you sure it's good?
It wouldn't be the first time they fool you.
It has an authenticity certificate - and the seller is decent. - Is that why it's so cheap?
He's old and sick and can't take care of it any more.
- He said it's perfect for her.
- How touching.
Dad, where does all this hostility come from?
Speak for yourself.
When you were 18 or 19 I tried to approach you.
You had been very ill and your mother wanted us to talk.
I told you I knew I had been a bad father, but I wanted to make it better. And you screamed.
Yes, screamed:
Bad father? !
You never were a father!
Then you said you could do without my help.
Honest hate must be respected;
I respect it.
But I couldn't care less if you hate me. You hardly exist.
If it wasn't for Karin, who thank God is like her mother, you wouldn't exist at all for me.
There's no hostility here, I swear.
Give me the name and number of the cello owner and I'll see.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
- What's your answer?
- I'll let you know.
Can I go?
I'm leaving.
- Can I just say one thing?
- Only if you must.
That tale of an argument fifty years ago in no excuse.
Poor Anna.
Will you hit me now?
FIVE
I hope I'm not interrupting.
No, I've just finished.
I practice in the mornings.
The organist is expecting: I'm replacing her.
- I thought you played the cello.
- I have an organ diploma.
In my time, it was smart to have one.
There were a lot of churches and few orchestras.
What were you playing?
A Bach sonata for a trio. First movement.
- It was beautiful.
- This is a unique organ from 1728.
Nobody knows how it ended up here, in the middle of nothing.
A few weeks ago, Karin and I played a concert here.
It was almost full.
- Will you be playing any more concerts?
- I don't have the time.
Karin has to prepare her audition and I have to finish my book.
Yes, I'm writing a book about Bach's Passion of St. John.
I met Karin. They say she's talented.
She's considered exceptional, and not only by her dad.
- Are you her teacher?
- That's the way it's turned out.
In the conservatory, she'll have the best European teachers.
- Won't it be difficult to let her go?
You could say that.
- Do you love her a lot?
- Yes.
- I'm sorry. - No, it's all right.
- Karin is like Anna.
- She doesn't look like her.
What's wrong?
Whenever I mention Anna, I cry.
That's the way it is.
I can't help it.
She's been dead for two years and it still hurts just the same.
That's the way it is.
Life itself has become a ritual.
I don't know, I can't find words to describe it.
I've become a handicapped person.
Just like that.
Handicapped.
Karin is everything that lends sense into my life.
And so... It wouldn't have much sense without her.
I think a lot about death these days.
I think:
One day I'll walk through the forest to the river. A foggy, windless autumn day.
Absolute silence.
Then I see someone by the gate.
Coming towards me.
She's wearing a denim skirt... A blue jacket...
She's barefoot and her hair is tied up in a long pony tail.
And she's walking towards me.
Anna is walking towards me, through the gate.
And then I realize I'm dead.
Then something strange happens.
I think: "Is it this easy?"
We spend life thinking about death and what comes after. And then it's so easy.
I can see a flickering light in the music. Like Bach.
- I think I understand.
- Come for dinner tonight.
- We're good cooks.
- Thanks, I like that.
I have to go now, we've got a class.
Karin gets angry if I'm late.
- See you soon.
- Wait, I don't think I can go.
- I understand.
The old man would get mad... - No.
- Why did you come here?
- I don't know.
You're a lawyer, right?
Can I sue him?
- Why would you want to do that?
- He's got a fortune and won't die.
He's probably mummified by his own evil.
I asked him for an advance on my inheritance, but he humiliated me.
I'd love to sue him.
Not while he's mentally competent.
- He's not ill in that sense.
- No, he's not ill.
Are you here to ask for money for a poor abandoned wife?
Don't get angry. Of course I ask myself.
You haven't had contact for decades.
I'm not here to ask for money.
Are you fucking?
Do you hate him so much to have to talk this way?
Forgive me for desecrating this place and ruining our chat.
I hate him in all possible dimensions of the word.
I hate him so much, I would like to see him die from a horrible illness.
I'd visit him every day, just to witness his torment.
Maybe I'm just a pathetic soul. Theoretically.
I see surprise and displeasure in your eyes.
As a lawyer, you should be used to... the stupidity and repulsiveness in the world.
Goodbye, Marianne.
It was nice of you to listen to me.
Sometimes I think I'm insane.
I suffer all the time.
SIX AN OFFER
- Karin!
- Hi, granddad.
- Well... this is my study.
- I haven't been here for years.
You and Anna would come sometimes, when you were living at the lake house.
- You used to smoke then.
- Yes, you're right.
I stopped when I read Freud's biography. 33 operations for a mouth cancer. - And even then he couldn't stop smoking.
- Bur are you all right?
Unless you consider aging an illness.
- That's a beautiful picture of mom.
- I found it by chance.
I had it blown up... and there it is.
I think of mom every day. And dream of her at night.
I thought the pain would subside. But that's not happening.
But it doesn't hurt like in the beginning, now it's here.
Like a part of me.
I wouldn't want to be without her.
I can say I miss her, painfully.
We didn't see each other very often, due to Henrik and I.
Anna tried and tried.
But Henrik and I never managed... well, you know.
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Yes, sit down.
Last night, Mrs. Nilsson came personally to deliver a letter.
Meaning that dad shouldn't... That was all right.
He's in Uppsala with his orchestra.
I have here a letter that came a few days ago, and it involves you.
- Have you heard of Ivan Chablov?
- Director in St. Petersburg.
He toured here recently with the philharmonic. Fantastic!
I've known him since my years in Leningrad.
This letter is from him.
"Johan, my dear friend and brother".
"Sorry for writing in my poor English and German"
"but my excellent secretary has just had twins".
"It's very important that I write you, my dear friend".
"For the following reason:"
"On a free night, I went to a young musician's concert".
"I must say I was surprised and happy".
"A young female cellist was playing... "a Zoltan Kodaly solo piece."
"And I was surprised by that young performer's talent."
-"Her maturity, her skill and courage".
- Well, I'll be!
"The school gave me her name...""
"and told me her father was her teacher."
"I got in touch with him, but he rejected me curtly,"
"maybe arrogantly is a better word."
"My dear Johan, I know you're ..."
her grandfather.""
"And that's the reason why I'm writing you."
"The young lady's technique is risky, somewhat lacking:""
"which could result in a future catastrophe".
"I'm a guest professor at Helsinki's Sibelius Academy,""
"One of the best in Europe."
"I have a good rapport with the president."
"And we could, after the mandatory exam,"" "offer our young cellist a quality education.. that her talent obviously deserves."
Let me know your answer as soon as possible.
My embrace, Ivan.""
So, Karin, what do you say?
Maybe I should add... that I'll take care of all your expenses as long as you need it.
I've spoken to the cello seller: I've made him a good offer.
More than he was asking for. So if you want it, it's yours.
Assuming, of course, that you accept Chablov's kind offer.
I don't know what to say. It's overwhelming.
I understand this letter puts you in an awkward situation.
- I'll write him and tell him that you're... - Flattered.
But that your decision affects others.
- Others?
- Your father, specifically.
I need to rest. Goodbye, Karin.
Thanks for the chat.
Marianne used to say that I was a terrible character judge.
That I didn't understand emotions. But even I understand this:
Your mother lived in this world... to do the most unbearable chore.
Darkness got even darker... and light faded away when Anna died.
It's hard for Henrik. To live. Despite everything.
You're like your mother. And I'm fond of you, Katja.
- Goodbye, Karin.
- Goodbye, grandfather.
SEVEN ANNA'S LETTER
- To Henrik from Anna?
- I found it in a book.
May 18.
Anna... wrote it one week before dying.
I'd like you to read it.
I can't understand Anna's handwriting.
You'll have to read it to me.
I'll try.
Here, have some whisky.
Mom had found out a few days before... that she didn't have much time left.
She wrote the letter because Henrik had a cold... and wasn't allowed to visit her.
It says:
"The fact that you can't visit me is, perhaps, a relief for both".
"We understand each other well.
You open the door."
"I make an effort. You make an effort".
"But I still see in your eyes how sick I am".
This is the difficult part.
- She writes about dad and me.
- Is that painful?
Yes.
When you were with her at the hospital, did you speak about what she had written?
- No, never.
- What did she write?
"Dear Henrik, I have to tell you something of which we've never spoken".
"I've wanted to talk to you about Karin".
"But it was never necessary because I was always there".
"Then I got sick and I was there no longer".
"Of course I was there, but you kept me apart".
"You and I love each other.
I was sure about our love".
"But no love is strong enough... to stand a devastating effect like my illness".
"I see that you love Karin, but that you also tie her to you".
"It's good that you were her teacher, but there's a limit".
"When I'm no longer there, the limit will be unclear".
"I know that Karin loves you".
"But you mustn't use her love. You'll hurt her".
"That could be a permanent wound".
"That's why I ask you to let her go".
"You shouldn't take advantage of her kinship".
"Don't take advantage of her because you're her self-proclaimed teacher.
"Dearest Henrik".
"You're so sensitive, so considerate, so kind".
"I know it, without a doubt, after so many years together".
"But you must be careful not to burden Karin... with the orphaned love that will remain when I'm no longer there".
There's more, but I don't want to read any more.
I can't. It hurts so much!
I can hear my mother's voice!
Karin...
Why did you reach out to me?
- You're very involved.
- You could say that.
- And you know about granddad's plans.
I don't expect advise, I need to hear my voice aloud.
I believe things will clear up this way.
- Mom saw.
- Yes, I think so. And everything she warned about has happened.
- I can't accept grandfather's offer.
- Why not?
If I leave Henrik, he'll die!
If I leave him, he'll die...
I'm sure about it, Marianne...
He doesn't even have his orchestra anymore!
He can go on with his music, but the county is reorganizing... and dad will not be part of the administration: he'll resign.
I can't leave him.
I'm so tired of him sometimes!
I know all the things I can do in the future. But mom is dead, and Henrik can't manage his own life.
How do you think I'd feel with the guilt if something happened to him?
My future and Henrik's are entwined for now.
- At least you say "for now".
- Only for consolation.
- I want you to know that I don't feel the same as you.
- Anna's love...
- That letter is love.
Isn't it?
I don't know.
EIGHT
- Back already?
- There wasn't much to do in Uppsala.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, little Katja.
What score is that?
Bach's suites for cello!
You're mad!
Listen, Anderberg suggested that you and I... play a concert in November.
- It's very hard for me. - We'll play together.
- What do you mean together?
- Like a dialogue, facing each other.
You'll play the parts you can handle and I'll play the difficult ones.
Especially the prelude.
It'll be great!
- Which parts can I play?
- The Sarabandes, for example.
- It takes a lifetime to tame them.
- We have three months.
- And my audition?
- It's almost ready.
And students get permission to play concerts.
I've spoken to Börtz.
It'll be good for the both of us, now that I don't have the orchestra.
I won't even be the first violin any longer.
- Dad! You must be furious!
- Perhaps. But now I'll have more time for you.
- I can help you better.
- Yes, of course.
That doesn't sound very encouraging.
Hello, Katja, darling.
I have a feeling an argument is coming.
- What's wrong, Katja?
- I don't know.
That is, I think I know, but I don't know how to...
I know you've talked to your grandfather.
- And with the bitch, I mean Marianne.
- Yes.
- I see. You did it beautifully.
- I must decide.
- I thought you had already done that.
- No, you did it.
Really?
I mean, is that what you've been thinking? Dad...
I haven't bothered to think. I thought, "Dad knows what's best for me".
Perhaps you've already made up your mind, haven't you?
Will you accept your grandfather's offer?
- Have you read this?
- I have.
- You read the letter that mom wrote me?
- It speaks about me.
But it was for me! And you read it. Just like that.
Do you think that's all right because it speaks about you?
If you're going to get so upset, it's no use talking about it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- I said I'm sorry, damn it!
- Why do you say you're sorry?
Shall we get to work?
Dad...
It'll be painful.
For you or for me?
It may sound stupid, but your tone frightens me.
I've made up my mind.
For the first time in my life it's my decision.
- But are you sad?
- Yes, I'm sad.
If you had told me you had that letter from mom...
If you had let me read it, maybe we could have...
You never told me... You should have...
- Well, that's the way it is.
- How?
Next week, I'm going to Hamburg with Emma.
She and I will be going to a school for young orchestra musicians.
Claudio Abbado will come in October and we'll go to Munich.
It's for young people from all over Europe. You can't be older than 22.
Abbado will work with us for six weeks and we'll play four concerts.
Emma recorded a video. She sent it to the admission committee, as a joke...
We played Brahms.
Emma and I got a letter... which says the school accepts us.
That we're welcome.
And that...
That's exactly what I want to do.
And it's exactly what I've decided to do.
And the conservatory?
- How long is the Hamburg course?
- Two years.
Then there's a paid internship in an Austrian or German orchestra Three years.
- How will you pay for it?
- I have my inheritance.
- You've been thinking a lot.
- I told Emma it was useless. That you had already decided.
God...
Oh God...
But dad, I don't want to... I don't consider myself a soloist.
I want to play in an orchestra, be part of a team effort.
Not sit down in a stage, alone and exposed.
I don't want strangers to say that I'm not good enough.
I want to decide my own future. I want a simple life
I want to be... home. To live a normal life.
Not a poor substitute for mom... who gets your praise for something I'm not.
It has to end.
And now it's ended.
At least, give it the perfect ending.
What are you talking about?
Wouldn't you like to play the fifth Sarabande?
- Right now?
- Yes, please.
NINE CRUCIAL MOMENT
He's here.
Thank you.
- Can I ask who it was?
- From the hospital.
Henrik tried to commit suicide. With pills.
Then he cut his arms and neck with a knife.
He's in intensive care.
Call this number and ask for nurse Ingegerd.
- God.
- They found him at the last moment.
A certain Mrs. Berg was walking by the house...
- and saw a naked person on the floor.
- God.
The door was unlocked. She tried to wake him up, but he was unconscious. And bleeding.
The ambulance took 20 minutes.
- My God.
I should call Karin, but she's on her way to Hamburg.
Henrik systematically fails at everything. He can't even kill himself.
- Say something, for God's sake.
- You want me to answer that?
- Whatever.
Say something spontaneous for once.
- You can't.
Sometimes you act like a forgotten character... in some stupid old movie.
- You're not real. - You don't say.
- Right now... no, let's leave it.
- No, go on.
Where did you gather all this disdain?
I didn't remember you like this.
- Disdain?
- Yes!
I don't know. Any disdain I have is for myself.
I don't know. I never thought of it this way.
- And the poor boy?
- Boy?
Ah, Henrik. Maybe he realized he was a lot like me.
I was never like him. So ridiculous all the time. Obese and submissive.
He surrounded me with a sticky love.
I admit I ignored that love.
He was as dedicated as a dog.
I wanted to kick him, metaphorically.
- What will happen now?
- How will this affect Karin?
- She'll blame herself.
- She should have thought about it.
- Do you think she'll return home?
- I don't know.
- You'll speak to her, won't you?
- If we find her.
I'll hire you as my agent.
How much do you charge?
Money is no problem.
As long as you put her guilt in a safe.
What if she comes?
She loves that bastard.
- That would be disastrous!
- Yes, I believe so.
What can I say?
I was so close to Anna.
It was terrible when she left. For me also. Even though I was on the outskirts of the catastrophe.
It's incomprehensible that Henrik... had the privilege of loving Anna.
And that she loved him.
- You're smiling ironically.
- No.
I'm not smiling. I'm trying not to cry.
There's no reason for you to cry.
There is, but I won't give any explanations.
TEN THE HOUR BEFORE THE DAWN
Marianne.
Marianne!
Sorry to wake you up.
It's all right.
- What's wrong?
Johan? - I don't know.
- I think it's anguish. - Anguish?
What do you mean?
- I see!
You're sad! - I'm not sad...
It's worse. It's an anguish from hell. It's bigger than me.
I'm too small for this anxiety.
Are you afraid of death, Johan?
More than anything, I'd like to scream.
What can you do with a baby that won't be comforted?
- Come, lay by my side.
- There's no room.
- We've slept in smaller beds.
- We won't be able to sleep.
It doesn't matter. Not in the last days of our lives.
I have to take off my shirt. It's damp from my diarrhea.
Come on.
You take it off too.
Yes
Come on, Johan. Come here.
There... lie down.
- Good night, Marianne.
- Good night.
Could you explain why you turned up here?
- I thought you were calling me.
- I never called anyone.
- I had it in my head.
- How strange.
I understand your not understanding.
- How long will you stay?
- I have a case on the 27th.
- November?
- October.
- Good night, again.
- Good night.
Perhaps you're asking yourself how it came out.
I stayed with Johan until early October.
Our time together was relaxingly pleasant.
We almost never talked about sensitive subjects.
The last night we celebrated.
Nothing out of this world, but good enough.
We promised to remain in touch.
I think we even fantasized about a trip to Florence... the next spring.
That trip never happened, of course. But we used to speak on the phone on Sundays.
Then, one day Mrs. Nilsson answered the phone.
She said that Johan couldn't take any calls, but that he would write.
I asked if he was all right;
she said yes, as far as she could tell. That he was just tired and that he would be writing.
I never got a letter, of course.
I wrote him, but never got an answer.
That's all I know.
Things are always all right with me. In order.
Everything in its place. Maybe I'm a bit lonely, but I don't know.
Sometimes... I think of Anna. I wonder how she managed her life.
How she spoke... How she moved...
Her look...
That almost surreal smile.
Anna's feelings.
Anna's love.
Well...
Something happened to me that perhaps is related to this.
When I came back, I visited my daughter Martha at the sanatorium.
But I thought about the enigma... that for the first time in our lives...
I realized... I felt... that I was touching my daughter.
My baby.
Lidia BOBROVA's film
G R A N N Y
- Be quiet!
- We are quiet!
Hush.
Get out of the house!
Out, are you deaf?
Granny!
Out! Now!
I won't pass my exam tomorrow!
You'll pass it all right, Lyubasha.
Don't let them back until evening. And let Taika sleep.
Granny!
Nursery rhyme
Many years have passed
Mom!
Mommy!
My darling daughter, don't cry
Have you told her?
Vera!
Mummy dear...
Ivan is going into hospital... For an operation...
Taia will take Vera while I'm in hospital. No less than two months...
What about me?
I'll take you to your sister Anna.
I've written her already.
I won't give her away to anyone. I pity her.
Oh, come on.
You'll leave the gas on - and half the house will blow up.
Or flood it with water.
I'm not that helpless.
I do still look after myself.
You can hardly move around.
You need care yourself.
I'm still on my feet.
I won't give my daughter away.
You women, you won't manage without me.
Stop it...
When Ivan is out of hospital, we'll take you back.
Oh I pity you.
It's all right.
- Come here...
- When am I leaving?
Now.
Thank you, my dear Mom...
Four officers got blown up in Grozny on a distance-controlled mine, the number of victims amounts to 11 people this week.
The mine war is going on in Chechnya...
Is it still far?
Relax. We'll get there.
What are these?
Houses of 'new Russians'.
Which Russians?
Like us?
Here we are. Out you get.
Anybody home?
Victor!
Get up!
Make your aunt welcome!
Is he still alive?
He's breathing...
Get up! Get up!
Uh, the devil!
You've come back again!
Not again -just for a visit.
Now you'll get it on your ugly face!
- Victor, calm down...
- Who are you?
I'm your aunt.
- Is the horned one with you?
- Me, a horned one?
I am a man enough to give horns to anyone.
- So who is this then?
- This is Ivan.
Ivan?
Ivan indeed.
Bloody hell, I took you for the devil.
You've drunk your brains out.
- Ivan!
- Come on...
Say hello to your aunt Tosia.
That's good. I just can't be alone here. This place is haunted.
- Where's Mother?
- Whose mother?
Yours. Her name's Anna. Remember?
- She's got out of harm's way.
- I must be off now. Will you come back to take me home?
You are my very welcome one.
I'll go look for your Mom.
Are you looking for someone?
Nanny Tosia, my sister. She's the one who nursed me.
My neighbor Valya.
We get along better than a family.
- We could've been your family.
- What family?
My son and her daughter Lisa were in love.
He has no one to blame.
Can't he forget Lisa and marry someone else?
- Sonny, are we rehearsing?
Nikolai our head of cultural affairs here.
We're having a festival soon...
Look - she is graceful like a Swan Princess.
Where shall I put it?
- You like it?
- Oh yeah.
It fits her all right!
Yury Ivanov, 10 years old
Sasha Semenov, 7 years old
Here he is.
That's just great!
- Where are your pictures, Victor?
- Burnt them when drunk.
Nevermind. Let's go inside before all the seats are taken.
Victor, my friend!
You're here too!
He who drinks is no friend to us.
But I don't drink 15 days non-stop.
I drink three days and then take hair of the dog.
- Fifteen days, Victor.
- Give me a break, marmalade.
- Mother! Father! - Here we are!
Daughter, you better quit this train business of yours.
The kids are unattended for two weeks at a time.
It's the most profitable journey!
You can't earn all the money. But the kids...
What about kids?
Kids need their father and mother.
Here all they need has been bought.
Shoes for Luba. Toy guns for Mishka and Grishka.
- And for Tolik...
For Tolik...
Granny!
- Good bye!
- Good bye!
Let's walk home.
Nikolai is busy drinking at the banquet.
- He doesn't drink!
- There's a reason...
- What reason?
- Lisa has left her husband.
Let the cat out of the bag? Why?
He's never get married because of Lisa, you know.
Aunt Tosia can't walk home, you know.
I'm just kidding.
But my heart is bleeding.
Should I die, Lisa will be all by herself.
- What about me?
- What about you?
Who will I be with?
With a bottle. It's dearer than your mother to you.
I quit drinking.
Oh! May God be your witness!
- There's no God!
- But there's Satan!
- Sure thing!
- You rascal!
- Nikolai!
- Are you crazy?
Mikhail Ivanov. - Where was he killed?
- In Grozny.
Vladimir Semionov.
In Grozny.
Yes, it is terrible.
But for me the most terrible thing is something else.
Do you know what a person feels like coming back from there?
You walk down the city streets, there's music, lights, laughter all around.
But just a few hours ago you were there where's there's filth and trenches.
Darkness. Death.
And questions come to your head.
Perhaps, they don't know, don't care?
What's happening to us?
Houses blow up.
Hundreds of people perish, hostages are taken...
We've got used to death on the screen.
We watch news from the battle field as regular entertainment.
But nobody would wish to be on the other side of the screen.
No, nobody would. But anyone may. Any time and any place.
And the recent events prove that.
So what's to be done?
Let's bring people who know how to stop it all. Watching TV!
There are people waiting for you on the porch.
Lisa again!
How long can it last?
Are you going to pine for Lisa till your hair turns grey?
Oh Ma!
Nowadays people sing on festive occasions.
Just remember...
KIA notice on father came during harvest time.
Oh, how Mother cried! Oh, how she suffered...
But then she picked up the scythe and started reaping.
She carried on to the end of the field.
Then she turned around and sang:
The man is brave and curly-headed Ringlets in three rows...
- A letter from Lisa, perhaps. - Here you are.
Thanks.
It's for you. Dance for your letter. - What?
- My feet don't dance any more.
Dance with your hands! Come on...
Here it is!
- Shall I fetch your glasses?
- Here... read it yourself.
'Dear Granny! This is Taia writing.
'A tragedy has befallen us.'
What tragedy?
Vera has had another stroke.
Is she alive?
Ivan has killed Vera.
How come?
He sent Aunt Tosia to you on purpose.
He drove Vera to a new stroke.
Vera lost her sight because of the twins.
Mishka and Grishka got burnt in Afghanistan.
When Vera lost her sight then the USSR came to an end.
You yourself told the story.
Taia came home from disco dances too late at night,
Ivan did not let her into the house.
Vera saw Taia from the window...
It was then that Vera had her first stroke.
Keep your voice down...
That's why Ivan appeared as the devil to me when he brought Aunt Tosia to stay...
He knew what would happen...
More to drink?
Do you know what the Bible says?
He who worships the Devil will drink the wine of God's rage.
But I've given up!
All right then.
Then answer me:
Why a human baby cries when born? - It's cold.
- It's scary.
What's there to be scared of?
A newly born doesn't understand anything yet.
- But has forebodings.
- 'Parliament' in session?
- We're just sitting.
- Debating!
Your 'debates' will end with a black eye again.
Get out!
- See?
- Mom!
You know me!
Leave us alone or else I'll get drunk again!
Shut up... Just don't yell...
- Aunt Tosia's not asleep.
- And she won't touch food.
Despondency is a heavy sin.
Help yourselves.
Tosia!
Look what I've bought!
Maybe you'd eat some?
It's yummy...
Have some.
No?
Well, all right...
Pity... Pity...
So lonely...
- Who? - Christ.
Abandoned by his disciples, denied three times by Peter.
Are you sick or what?
My Lord! If I had been your disciple
I would have followed you to Golgotha. Look here...
You'd better go home!
Mommy, see what a chair I've made.
As good as new. Sit down.
Test the chair...
Please...
- Are you sitting?
- I'm sitting.
- Comfortably?
- Comfortably.
You won't fall down?
My golden Mother...
Along to the road to Murom
There grew three pine-trees
My sweetheart taking Leave of me Until the next year spring
- Some warm milk?
- What about breakfast?
Well, have an egg.
Hard, soft boiled?
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
It's him - he's too sweet.
Mom, I'm off to an odd job.
He'll end up drinking, for sure.
- Why hiding here?
- I know better.
I know Victor like the palm of my hand.
It's not some work he's off to. He's off to his drinking buddies.
When he's back you won't recognize him.
Tell me how this Satan gets into him.
As if there is no better place for Satan.
Didn't you try to cure him?
Can the leopard change his spots...
It'll get warmer here now...
Sometimes he drives me so mad,
I wish I would move to Lisa's.
God endured and told us to endure.
He endured for good people - but we have to suffer for boozers?
Why did Lisa divorce her husband?
She put her work before her family.
Don't you meddle with politics, I'd say - let men sort it out.
- Her husband - is he ajournalist?
- A broker.
A motorcyclist kind of?
You can't...
You can't...
There's Mom there and the Aunt...
But you're the master here!
Open up!
Tosia!
Let's sing something spiritual.
What Mother used to sing:
Listen to a story Of love in simplicity A wondrous story
God has forgiven us for ever in Christ
God saved us from death
Yes, God has forgiven us For ever in Christ
God has saved us from death
Open up!
Or else...
Well, beware now!
Move clear of the window.
I'll bury you both!
Take that, Satan!
It's me, not Satan!
Take it, Satan!
I'm fed up with you!
- I won't do it again!
- Swear to God!
Here! I'll hang myself.
Does he mean it?
I'll go look.
I'm coming with you.
Step aside. God forbid I fall down and hit you.
Oh-oh! My leg! Oh, it hurts!
Victor, unlock the door! Call Valya!
It needs to be X-rayed.
Where?
At a hospital?
Can you have it done somewhere else?
Must we book in advance or what?
Have a look - is Victor alive there? Not choked himself I hope...
Is he alive?
- Alive.
- Hasn't he thrown the blanket off?
He's not a baby.
He's worse. A baby you can cover.
We must let Lisa know.
No!
She has her own worries at work.
What if they mess you up in hospital and you lose your leg? Pah!
Don't bring bad luck!
They don't mess up people.
People pay lots of money to doctors.
I'll pay too. Lisa's left me dollars.
Dollar's no help here. What if you get to some quack doctor?
So what do you suggest?
If Lisa comes - they'll give you the best doctor.
- But she's in America.
- It's no big deal.
She isn't gonna stay there for life.
When she comes, then you inform her...
I will give you to no one!
Lisa, my niece!
Aunt Tosia...
That's the way to greet me - with a half-empty bucket?
I can't carry a full one any more.
Can't someone else do it?
Let's go in...
Aunt Tosia, be careful...
It's slippery.
My sleeping beauty, what's wrong with you?
I'm ill.
Withdrawal symptoms?
Wow, my sis. I'm feeling bad.
Every time I come - you do.
- No, it's melted snow.
- Ah, never mind.
Oh, my little swallow!
You have flown in.
You haven't cut it off...
How did it happen?
It was slippery near the shop.
You still keep on running around.
You've gotten so thin.
I've been missing you, my daughter.
I remember once...
When I was in my teens...
I didn't know how to harness the horse... And they didn't allow me to plow.
And I just sat down and began crying...
Uhu... Come on remember the war...
During the war we worked giving all our strength without sparing ourselves.
For the front.
For the Motherland.
Did you get much in return for your sacrifices?
They paid us very little. With work days records.
So why did you work at all?
For whom all this sweat? - For the Motherland...
- And the Motherland?
The Motherland helped us a lot.
- Like how?
- A good pension was granted.
Oh really?
I get fifteen hundred roubles.
You're just our millionaire...
They've brought Mom back.
Oh, go away!
What's wrong with Mom?
Hipjoint fractured.
She'll be in hospital, what about me?
Grow up, find ajob.
You're a big person. Help me to find ajob.
I did this no end of times, but you're drinking.
- I agree to take treatment. - I'll be back soon.
Take me with you.
And what about Auntie Tosia?
Where shall we put up Aunt Tosia?
I'll take her to her family tomorrow.
Lisa, who wants her there?
What do you mean 'who'?
Ivan. Grandchildren.
Ivan won't take her in.
Isn't he a Christian?
She's nursed all his children.
He wangled a good pension for her.
Hasn't she sold her house? And gave the money to the grandchildren.
They won't have her. None of them.
So what do you suggest then?
To let her stay with Victor?
Lmpossible!
Blast you!
Aunt Valya!
Are you home?
Come on in!
- How is your mother?
- Hipjoint fractured.
Well, a fracture isn't AIDS.
Could Aunt Tosia stay with you while Mom's in the hospital?
I will pay you.
It's not a matter of money, Lisa.
A friend of mine is coming to stay with her 2 daughters.
It's a shame to be a bachelor. Why doesn't he get married...
Oh yes...
To both of them?
The Parliament is thinking about a law on polygamy.
Perhaps it'll be passed.
Blossom, blossom Blossom, mountain-ash
Let your berries swell With orange colours
Yesterday I met a lad
I met a lad Near a drying house
'I have come From faraway,' he said
'I will tarry here,' Said the lad.
'To become a farmer,' Thus he spoke, 'And to mow the grass With your menfolk.'
He will don a blouse so blue And the poplar's fluff will whirl
He's a city guy And I'm a peasant girl
Sing, oh, nightingale Sing
I have met my love this spring
Love is no potatoes rotten Thrown out and forgotten
Stop talking about love. Speak about a bath-house.
Now some woman with sharp teeth gonna see you off.
We've talked our heads off. We came to say good bye, Tosia.
Here's to your health, grandma Tosia.
God bless you.
We'll see you off.
Keep well. Don't forget us.
Come and visit us.
- Let's drink! - Bottoms up.
It'll cheer us all up.
- Thank you very much. - Don't you weep.
- Are you getting warm?
- Yes-yes. We are.
Thank you.
Now I've a present to give to my hosts.
It's for you to eat. And this is for them.
Nah.
Why?
My hands are clean.
That's silly.
We were just kids then.
Turn it off!
6 million people have died in Russia during the past 8 years.
Turn it off!
'New Russians' - who are they?
The masters of this country.
- 'This' country?
- Don't get hung up on the words.
- Words is not what's wrong.
- What's wrong then?
- Buy some milk.
- No, thanks. Hi!
- Hi! - Gee!
Zhaleika pipes...
He knows how to play...
Too high sound...
- How much? - 200 roubles.
I'll take it.
Thanks, bye.
Wait here. I'll go up alone.
What if the lift doesn't work and Ivan is not home.
Lisa!
What a surprise!
Come over here!
- I didn't recognize you.
- Didn't you.
Take your coat off.
Come on in...
I read all your publications.
I watch you on the telly. You've really gone up in the world.
Tea?
Coffee?
Or have a drink, to warm yourself up.
Aunt Tosia is waiting outside in the car.
- I'll run down to get her.
- Wait. I won't let her into the flat.
- What do you mean?
- What I say.
She's your mother-in-law!
Used to be. Before Vera's death.
- What do we do then?
- I don't know.
To the dump, to the militia. It's your business.
Why 'my business'?
She didn't bring up MY children!
For this I arranged a good pension for her.
Wait a second.
Aunt Tosia is giving her pension to Tolik, your son.
Let us stop this useless talk, because I've said my say - no!
I've got two hundred dollars on me.
I wouldn't take her for a million.
My God!
Why doing this to her?
- What wrong did she do?
- It's not her.
Who then?
- But - tea or coffee?
- Is she a cat for you? A dog?
Am I a horse for you?
I haven't lived yet, been hacking away. Like a horse.
Since I was a child.
First - workdays.
Then 5-year plans.
A 5-year plan in 4 years.
Then a family. And all the time - come on, come on.
Thirty odd years I worked at the railways, hacking myself and covering for others.
I was dreaming: God! Let me rest when I retire.
This pension - here it is, nothing for my pains.
Vera fell ill
- I didn't give her away to hospital.
I fed and bathed her myself.
I have a right to live for my own sake at the end of my life.
I haven't told you the most important thing.
My mother hasn't refused to take her in.
It's that just now she's at hospital. We can't rely on Victor. Sure thing.
Take her to your place then.
- To Moscow?
- People live in Moscow too.
I am away from home practically all the time.
Your work comes after your aunt, eh?
- Are you mocking me, eh? - Come on.
You defend human rights in Chechnya, don't you?
She is not my grandmother!
Nor she is mine!
I don't advise to take her to Tolik:
He himself is a refugee, lives in somebody else's house.
Give me the address of Taia and Luba then.
They won't have her either.
They took the money from the sell of her house.
They invested it in business. And they prospered.
No!
He is scoffing!
I'll just leave her at your door.
It's better to put her into an old age home.
You have connections.
- It can't be done in a day.
- Right. Where can we find time for poor relatives when our heart is aching for the whole world.
Luba's address is:
Mira street, number five...
Fall, you faded window curtain Upon my withered geraniums
Get thee gone, my unbelievable Life of a gypsy
Close those shining eyes Of thee
The clock - Ivan has thrown it away.
If only it was just the clock. Let's go to Luba's!
Have you taken my medal back from Ivan's place?
- What medal?
- For Stalingrad.
- You fought at the front?
- I dug trenches.
Medals give some privileges. My grandpa had a medal.
- Did you leave anything else?
- Just odds and ends.
Then Luba will come and collect them.
- Leonid?
- Yes.
- Where is Luba?
- She's not here.
- But where is she?
- She won't be back soon.
I've brought Granny to stay with you.
Why to us?
- Who is he?
- My granddaughter's husband.
Let her favourites take her in.
But Aunt Tosia divided the money for the house between the three of you.
Luba and I were asking for a half. We were just starting our business then - we needed money badly.
Taia and Tolik squandered their money.
Tolik is a refugee, mind you.
In somebody's flat.
Taia has bought a flat in a high-class quarter!
So. Give Taia's address then!
I don't remember the house number. The posh suburb.
But you remember where it is?
So. Get into the car - show the way.
Follow me.
Taia will take me in. Don't worry.
Excuse me, do you have any empty bottles?
No.
Taia, this is Leonid. Open up.
You think I'm an alkie and a bum?
I worked 57 years, for your information.
Then why are you doing this?
My pension isn't even enough to last half a month.
Hold on!
Is it to me?
What do you want?
- I want you to be a human being.
- I beg your pardon?
- Say hello to Granny.
- Go to hell!
People, people!
What's going on? Nikolai!
Don't, my dear...
Some more water?
Did Vera suffer long in hospital?
Mom died on the same night.
And in two weeks this woman appears at my father's place.
He goes everywhere with her.
He came to ours' on the New Year Eve. And made a scene. He said:
I wished to take away his flat. Why would I want his flat?
Look at my gorgeous flat.
Did he have this woman before Vera's death?
Before...
Why?
My little son...
My pride.
It needs a copper coin.
- Where on Earth can I get one?
It used to be a regular two-bedroom flat.
It was my husband's idea.
What a sauna!
Just a place for Granny to warm her bones.
- Granny?
- She's outside in the car.
Have you brought her to me?
Leonid and your father refused to take her in.
Oh, but I can't either.
Why?
I'm leaving... to the dentist.
But you'll be back?
We have no spare room:
Where shall I put her?
In the drawing room.
- Here we receive people we need.
- What? People you need, eh?
But when Granny was selling her house was she a person you needed then?
- Why are you like that?
- And why are you like that?
You are not at all sorry for her, are you?
- I 'am' sorry, but... - But what?
See, men come here, they drink here, they talk loudly.
She'll only feel worse here.
Then you should tell these men not to come here.
Then my husband will throw me out.
Who are you in this house then?
- Just a nobody!
- What does it mean - a nobody?
It means what it means!
To be a somebody one needs to have something. And I'm good only to serve him cabbage soup.
What am I supposed to think of?
You are smart and strong. Think of something.
Am I to take her to Tolik's?
He'll take her in. She'll be fine there.
Believe me, she'll be fine there.
Good thinking.
Tolik is a refugee, he enjoys no rights at all.
He'll be the first to be thrown out, together with Granny.
I can't take her in. Kill me -
I can't!
So.
You will take her to Tolik yourself.
I'm not made of iron too.
I have to go out and look her in the eye every time.
Let's do it together.
Granny...
My little daughter, my sweetheart is no more!
Granny, calm down.
We'll go to Tolik.
You'll be better off there.
Don't cry, Granny.
Tolik will take you in.
All will be fine.
I'm not crying.
But how is Olenka?
Oh, Granny. Your great granddaughter is as before... In shock.
You know, Lisa, Tolik's house was bombed. Very many people got killed.
Both Chechens and Russians.
For Olya's birthday
We baked a sweety pie
As wide as that
As narrow as that
As tall as that As low as that
Sweetie pie, sweetie pie Chose the one who you love
Yes, of course I love you all
But Mom and Daddy best of all
Now we blow the candles out.
Take a deep breath and blow like the wind...
Ten candles means you are ten years old today.
Our Mommy is clever, a strong fine girl!
She has blown the candles out, but not all. And we shall put out the rest of them.
Let's take a really deep breath...
Deeper, Olenka, deeper.
Let's do it together with Daddy.
Do you accept guests?
Most welcome. It is Olya's birthday today.
My congratulations!
Lisa, meet Masha.
More surprises coming. Granny is come.
Granny?
Where is Granny?
In the car at your door.
I dreamt of eggs which means guests.
Masha said:
Who can come?
And look, here she has come, our granny.
Welcome the guests.
Welcome the guests.
Can she at least hear?
She can hear and understand. But she can't speak.
Lisa, you defend people in Chechnya, don't you?
Olya is a victim of this war. So help her.
Get her into a hospital, still better in Moscow.
Olya, it is your great grandmother.
Do you remember Granny?
How she taught you reading, counting, reciting different verses.
There goes a bull-calf On the see-saw board
'Oh, I shall have a fall,' he says She was not even five then.
She can't remember.
I shouldn't have let her go to Chechnya.
Come and sit next to me.
We were all growing up and playing together.
I remember them as little ones.
They followed Granny everywhere like tails.
Leonid was our neighbor.
We loved her so much then...
You shouldn't think...
I am strong.
I'm just tired.
Oh, God, how tired I am.
What's this?
My battle for Stalingrad.
I don't get it.
My grandpa fought in the trenches which Aunt Tosia dug.
Don't answer it.
But it's about work.
Let's go back, take Aunt Tosia.
We'll cure Victor together from alcoholism.
Yes.
Speaking.
So, don't worry.
Let them talk.
I'll be back on Wednesday.
They have fallen asleep.
It's turned out so nicely. God!
Guests at Olya's birthday party:
Granny,
Taia, Lisa.
Lisa will help us, you'll see.
Olya will be treated in the very best clinic.
I don't believe in anything any longer.
Neither in treatments, nor in miracles.
She'll never ever utter a single word again...
God, if you exist and do not wish to help - take her to heaven and stop her tortures.
You can't say such things outloud!
Let everybody hear!
- I can't take it any more... - Quiet.
Shame on you.
We have been lucky. We have survived.
We're living in a warm house...
In somebody else's house!
You and I are living in someone else's house.
God!
The landlady will kick us out tomorrow.
We took in Granny without her permission.
In winter with a child - she has no right to do so!
Shut up about rights!
We enjoy just the only right:
To be refugees in our own country.
Good bye, Olenka.
An Angel is bidding me to go.
Masha!
Just the right moment...
- She's gone. - Masha! Gone-gone...
My little daughter, say it again for Mummy! She's cold.
Cold...
Cold, cold, cold...
Who is cold?
Granny is.
Thank you, God!
Granny...

Come in, please.
Pierre, it's a call from France, it's urgent.
After the concert.
It's about your mother.
Yes?
Chorists
Do you recognise me?
" Pond Bottom", " my father will pick me up on Saturday".
Pepinot
But of course.
Pepinot!
How long has it been?
Only 50 years.
"Pond Bottom".
There you are, the short one in the first row.
And this is you.
And the prefect, what was his name?
Clement Mathieu
Clement Mathieu
What became of him?
Open it.
"Pond Bottom" -- year 1949
This is the diary kept by Mathieu, about his days at "Pond Bottom".
About his story, and ours too.
He wanted you to have it.
I'd prefer to give it to you under happier circumstances but... 1949, Jan. 15th.
After a few years of failure, I was certain the worst was yet to come.
It was a boarding school for difficult children.
At least that's what the ad said.
"Pond Bottom"
The school seemed to be named just for me.
Good morning.
You are alone?
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for Saturday.
Why?
Because my father will come and fetch me.
But today is not Saturday.
Pepinot!
I'm Clement Mathieu, the new prefect.
Is this your first prefect position?
I once taught in a private school.
-What did you teach?
-Music.
-You will get on well with Mr. Rachin
The Headmaster. He used to play the trumpet.
Really?
These are his daughters, he lives here.
-Have you met him before?
-Not yet, I got the job through Mme Boissement.
Really?
That was Uncle Maxence
He proceeded to explain that he was in charge of... security, first aid, store room, and window repair.
What is he doing?
Student punished by Mr Rachin. 15 days of community service...
Maid work
What are the kids like?
Didn't they tell you?
No.
This is the infirmary.
Later I will show you my little vegetable patch.
With pleasure.
-What have they done this time?
-Let's me help you...
Are you Clement Mathieu?
The Headmaster.
Rachin, Headmaster.
Ah, Headmaster, I am sorry.
Yes, you are late.
-I was given the wrong bus timetable.
-Keeping on time is a basic principle here.
Very well.
Headmaster.
Very well, headmaster.
Ok, follow me.
I first suggest you learn our regulations. You will supervise study after 4pm.
What's the matter! Answer!
-Take this
Another trap.
Our pupils' lovely disposition.
Let's sit him down there.
I can't see.
Don't overdo it, let me take a look.
Not so good.
-You, go ring the bell, call everyone. -Shouldn't we call a doctor first?
You know how much they cost?
What did I tell you, go ring the bell.
Where is the bell?
Open the door, you'll see it.
Everyone here!
Everyone here!
Does this kind of incident often happen?
Ring, just ring the bell.
Everyone in the yard!
Quickly, keep quiet.
- Egg head!
- Quiet!
-Bullet head!
-Quiet!
Keep quiet.
-I didn't say anything!
-Quiet!
I've called you out because Uncle Maxence has just been wounded in a cowardly attack.
According to our "action-reaction" principle, the one responsible shall be severely punished.
If the guilty one does not turn himself in within 3 seconds, You will all take turns in jail, 6 hours each.
Until he turns himself in or is denounced.
One two three
No one?
Naturally.
Come here.
You, Mathieu
Me?
Come here.
Mr. Chabert, give me the record book, thank you
Mr. Mathieu, the new prefect, is fortunate not to know you yet.
Egg head!
Be quiet.
He will therefore decide impartially who will be punished first.
Be quiet!
Pick a name.
At random?
If I may...
Leave him. Go ahead
Boniface
Unlucky.
Chabert, bring Boniface out.
But, I didn't do anything!
Shut up!
It's unfair! Shut your mouth!
Let's go.
I won't go!
I'll kick your ass if I have to!
Quiet!
In addition, as long as the criminal is at large, recess is canceled, And visits are forbidden.
I invite you to denounce him as fast as possible.
This only encourages denouncing.
Like all new-comers, you have generous illusions. Let's talk again in a week.
Until then have Mr Regent show you your quarters. You're taking over from him.
Clean sheets.
Thanks.
Why are you leaving?
10 stitches
Scissors.
All this because I confiscated Mouton's cigarettes.
Mouton?
A kid.
His name is Mouton.
For your info, Le Querrec is the one who set the trap on Maxence's door.
I overheard him talking about it.
Why did you keep silent?
I don't want to miss the bus.
Maxence punished him for breaking some window panes.
It's a revenge. Just his style.
Le Querrec, you have remember this name.
And "Morange", yes, "Morange"
He speaks little, but you have to keep an eye on him.
Angel face, but possessed by the devil.
Action/reaction, that's all they understand.
I'm leaving. Good luck!
Thank you.
Our benefactor.
This is the class schedule.
Classes were split between the headmaster, doing history and French, while the rest was taught by a certain Mr Langlois.
Mr. Langlois, let me introduce our new prefect.
My name is Clement Mathieu A prefect at your age?
Yes, I was once a teacher.
That is perfect.
He's the funniest of the lot.
Go to the study room now
- You are late.
No need to show you the way...
Gentlemen.
Smoking is forbidden in class, everyone, even you, sir.
Give it back to me, quiet!
Give it back to me.
Good start!
Congratulations. Mathieu
Be seated.
Naturally. You, always you.
What did he do?
Nothing. Headmaster
What do you mean, nothing.
Didn't you want to punish him just now?
I was asking him to the blackboard, and requesting silence when you came in.
Indeed you needed silence. Don't let me have to come back.
Go to the corner.
All right. Now that you know me better, we need to set a few things straight.
Right now, one of your fellow pupils is in jail. For nothing.
I may not look smart, but I was not born yesterday.
I know who did it.
I give him 15 seconds to confess.
I am waiting.
Too bad. Only 5 seconds left.
Too late.
Le Querrec, who is Le Querrec
Me, sir
What a coincidence.
So, it is you who wounded Mr. Maxence.
No. not me. I am not asking you.
I am telling you.
I did nothing.
Who do you think the headmaster will believe, you or me?
While I am out, I would like someone serious to watch over the class.
If I believe my trusted intuition, this serious person is Mr Morange.
Be quiet, who is Morange?
Me, sir.
So, you are the angel face
Go to the blackboard. You watch the class while I am out.
Let's go!
Nice attire.
Pull your shirt out further, it's more proper.
Black sheep are said to have authority over their peers. Prove it to me.
Let's go. To the headmaster.
Have mercy, sir.
Mercy?
Did you show mercy on the classmate who is in jail instead of you?
How about Uncle Maxence?
I didn't want to harm him. It was just a joke. A joke?
It's enough. Do you hear, You'll get a good beating in my office.
Who is that?
It's Leclerc, he ran away for the third time.
He will be sent to jail. This way you'll have a companion.
Let's go.
Listen. Maybe we can make a deal.
You wounded uncle Maxence badly. Really bad.
I will not bring you to the headmaster, but I'll punish you.
From now on, during recess, you'll work in the infirmary.
You will look after Uncle Maxence, until he is recovered.
Do you agree?
Not bad, ah?
I believe I can do better. Show me your profile.
Profile.
I give you a little smile for a change.
There you go. Have a look.
Ah, I forget. A little spot of colour.
Does it look better?
Go back to you seat.
All right, in order to know you better, Please write down your name, age and what you want to do when you grow up.
To my surprise, all the pupils did as they were asked.
Everybody, expect one.
Aren't you writing?
How long have you been here?
A long time?
I don't know.
Come on, write, little boy.
An exhausting first day.
I don't know why I am here.
Rachin scares me. This place scares me.
Even the kids scare me.
I feel they may run into my room at any time and do me in.
My blanket.
Give me a puff.
Shut up. Go to sleep.
I read what the pupils wrote.
They were all dreaming of fabulous carreers.
Two firemen, three cowboys, one tiger-tamer, one fighter pilot two spies, a general under Napoleon. one hot air balloon pilot, three soldiers.
No prefect.
It's very kind to volunteer to take care of me.
See, doctor, the new prefect asked for a volunteer. And he responded. Spontaneously.
This shows miracles do happen.
Please come in.
This is Mr. Mathieu, our new prefect.
How are you How are you
How is he?
It's quite a bad gash. If now they come after you, hope is lost.
You have such infinite patience towards them.
I'm hard headed.
The poor kids have it way worse than me here.
One of them died here.
One died?
His name was Mouton. Jumped from the rooftop.
Fortunately, he was an orphan.
Like him, everyone says nothing can be done. But that's not true.
He's a good boy. You just need to know him.
Uncle Maxence is kind, isn't he?
Le Querrec, I am talking to you.
Uncle Maxence is kind, isn't he? Yes.
I can't hear you.
Leave him alone. He is shy, just like me.
Yes?
I need to talk to you. Headmaster.
You already want to leave?
No, I just want to do an experiment.
About uncle Maxence's accident.
That was no accident.
Sure. I would like you to grant me three things.
What?
First, lift the collective punishment.
Second, allow me to punish the guilty one.
Third, please allow me to keep his name to myself.
Provided you have the name.
Of course, only provided I have it.
You are arrogant, man.
So, you believe you can find him just like that.
Alright. If you succeed, I'll lift the punishment.
You'll never find the guilty party, or I am the king of imbeciles.
I know who did it, sir.
Is that so.
Who is it?
You allowed me to keep his name a secret.
Good, very good.
But your methods irritate me.
Don't let me find anything wrong with your class.
I feel I already have them well under control.
You speak too soon.
These are not naughty pictures.
I never said they were naughty pictures.
What's written on yours?
Ave Maria, Soprano, by Clement Mathieu
Mine says cord quatuor, by Clement Mathieu
This looks like music sheets.
How do you know?
Maybe it's morse code?
Secret codes?
Maybe he's a spy.
Yes, possibly a spy disguised as a prefect. Quick!
Egghead is coming.
Give it back to me.
What is it, sir.
None of your business. Any problem, Mathieu?
No, nothing.
These are music sheets.
What for?
A choir
In the toilet...
Choir, out you go.
None of this here, Mathieu None of what?
Don't pretend you don't know what I am talking about.
Certainly you don't believe...
I'll close one eye this time.
You really see evil everywhere.
Here? Yes.
Bullet head you're finished.
You won't make the rules here.
You won't make the rules here.
You won't make the rules here.
You won't make the rules here.
Hey, guys, are you chicken or what?
Your name is Corbin, right?
Sir, I did nothing.
Yes, you are singing.
Sir, I swear.
You are singing, besides, off-key.
You don't even know.
Come on, sing again, I am listening.
Maybe you want to sing in the principal's office.
Come on, sing:
Bullet head you're finished.
Bullet head you're finished.
You won't make the rules here.
You won't make the rules here.
No one ever told you that you sing really bad...
Is it true you have music in your briefcase, sir?
Mind your own business.
Which reminds me.
The next one I catch going through my things, it will cost him dearly.
Now, silence.
Go to sleep.
Finished.
Sleep.
I have this tune stuck in my head.
They don't sing very well, but they sing.
I even spotted a few good voices.
Is there really nothing we can do with these kids?
Me who swore never to touch my music sheets again.
Never say never.
There's always something to try.
January 23, one week after the accident. uncle Maxence's takes a turn for the worse.
The doctor has him sent to the hospital.
Will he die?
No, they will save him.
That same day, Pepinot got in trouble.
Mr. Pepinot, you are hopeless.
Last question, last one
How did Marshall Ney die?
I am waiting.
Hunting?
Zero.
You'll write a 100 times for tomorrow:
Marshall Ney was executed.
Dismissed
Boniface
Come here boy.
Boniface Here. It's a reward for your composition
You take this to madam Marie, she will give you a biscuit.
You did know that Marshall Ney was shot?
Yes, sir, just like Napoleon.
Get out.
Wait, Mr. Morange
I saw you taking notes during my class.
I must say such studiousness surprises me.
Bring me your notebook.
Charming.
There. Read it. Admire the spelling.
Mr. Rachin eats shit by the crate.
Did he write 'Mr.'?
Err, no
Mr. Mathieu, action and reaction, put him in jail.
Let's go
Gentlemen, good appetite.
Are you hungry Pepinot?
There, you can eat now.
Pepinot is an orphan.
His parents died during the war.
How did they die? Don't know.
The kid got it in his head that his father will come pick him up on Saturday.
Every Saturday, nobody comes. We tell him it's for next week, and so on.
Wouldn't it be better to tell him the truth?
We told him a 100 times that his dad and mum are both dead. Nothing doing.
Now, we let him wait by the gate, it makes him happy.
Be quiet.
You see?
Action and reaction.
What do you mean? Action?
Reaction!
Someone is asking for the Morange boy. Morange?
He is in jail.
No visit for the punished ones.
You know the rules
You go tell the visitor yourself.
How are you, madam.
How are you.
I am the new prefect.
I am Pierre Morange's mother.
Clement Mathieu
I know it's not visiting day today, but it's the only free time...
That's not it...
He is punished again?
No, no, he is not punished. But he is not here.
Why?
He was sent to the dentist an hour ago. Tooth ache.
Tooth ache. Yes tooth ache.
But nothing serious.
He will be back in the evening.
I can't wait. My shift starts at 5pm.
Can I pass you something for him?
Of course.
Her name is Violette, Violette Morange
Single mother. Despairing over her son's attitude.
Prone to stealing, introvert. Expelled from a few schools for running away.
When Pierre was sent to Pond Bottom against his mother's will,
She told the judge: at least, he'll have two warm meals a day.
Jan. 30, the experiment begins.

Mr. Pepinot, baton, thanks a lot.
Attention. Follow me.
There you have it!
One two three four The headmaster eats stale bread.
Lerlec is not very smart
Every night, I make them practice a simple tune I compose.
We are from Pond Bottom. That is rather disconcerting We are from Pond Bottom.
That is what is bothering us We are from Pond Bottom.
That is rather disconcerting
We are from Pond Bottom. That is what is bothering us. Not bad.
It was rather basic, but I had their attention.
To move things along, I needed support from my hierarchy. What?
A choir?
Yes
Poor Mathieu, you have gone off your rocker. A choir?
They will never sing a note, or I am the king of... Please sir.
Do not tell me king of what. Why?
Because they are already singing.
Really? A little.
So why do you come ask me for an authorisation since you've already gone ahead.
I don't like your methods, you hear me? Sir
You are bothering me.
I have other problems to deal with.
All right. I too want to have a laugh. Make them sing.
But if things go wrong, you'll lose your job. Go
Thank you for your kind words of encouragement, sir.
Feb. 8, first rehearsals. Rachin is relentless on Morange
After jail, he makes an example out of him:
one month of community service.
Hey, maid, don't forget to make my bed!
Feb. 15 A visit from Dr. Dervaux. He is a psychologist
He brought us a little present.
We decided to bring this boy from St Fereol's juvenile detention centre.
To study his capacity to adapt to a more liberal environment.
Unlike most of his classmates, Mondain is starting to read and write.
In any case, he can talk More or less normally.
We submitted his intellect to the Binet-Simon test
Ah, the Binet-Simon test!
We also gave him Rorchar's test Good.
The test, as you know, divides children's intelligent into 7 categories.
Normal, adequate, borderline, Slightly retarded, medium, severely retarded And finally, imbeciles
Mondain is in the borderline zone.
He is therefore not demented. I must however warn you. He exhibit gregarious-instinct pervert tendencies.
Bad enough. What exactly does that mean?
Doctor?
Prone to cruelty, parasitism and destruction.
Above all,
We already have lots like that here.
Except here kids have access to malstream teaching.
It will be interesting to see how Mondain can integrate Least we can do.
We will all try to meet your scientific expectations.
Gentlemen, kindly take charge of this boy.
May I keep you for lunch? With pleasure.
As for him, give him all the necessary attention.
Action and reaction.
No smoking here.
To start the experiment on a good footing, I first have to establish my authority.
You really look like a jerk.
You better lie low, or there will be trouble.
Ok.
There will be trouble.
Surely you know at least one song?
Yes, but...
But what?
You will not like it.
Let's have it. Come on.
Come on
I am listening.
(Dirty song) Stop enough.
I told you.
Not bad, needs practice. But you have quite a good baritone voice. What voice?
baritone, it is not an insult.
Describes singers with a deep voice.
Go to the back, with the basses.
Bitch.
Let the bitch rest.
The next one who laughs gets my fist in his face.
Whenever you wish, Mondain
Isolation over
I brought Pepinot back. You forgot him by the gate.
Pepinot, it's not Saturday today.
By the way, in the letters to your parents I don't have any parents.
Of course, to those who have parents
Remind them that they can visit you on the first or third Thursday of the month.
Morange, you are already distracted.
What did I just say?
I don't know.
I just said, you can write to your mother To visit you on the first or third Thursday every month.
Or on both days, got it?
But punished pupils cannot get visits so be careful. I don't feel like seeing my parents.
But Morange may want to see his mother.
Maybe he's not the only one.
See, Morange, we have a real choir now.
I don't care.
What do you mean you don't care? What kind of voice do you have?
Do a scale.
"Do"...
Come on.
Do you want to go back to jail? Come on, quick.
Rudeness does not look good on you, my boy. Not everyone can be like Mondain.
Let's start again.
Where are you going?
I've had enough, I am going to the toilet.
Mondain, wait.
Come,Corbin Can I also go to the toilet,sir?
All right, everybody out.
Quiet, quiet
You sing well, pretty girl.
You want some?
They left you all alone?
I will protect you.
Wait for me. We are alike.
My parents are assholes.
Your mother is the same way. She leaves you here to have peace. No, she has to work
-Ah, so what the others say is true.
She is a whore
Get in!
You're a dead man!
Am I?
That day, Morange was missing at the 3pm roll call.
No one ever knew where he went, but he came back.
That's what mattered.
Why are you here?
I'm not allowed to go upstairs
What do you mean?
Why?
Because I have no money
You have no money, so you can't sleep?
What is this all about?
It's Mondain. If I don't give him money, he won't let me upstairs.
We must be careful
Where I was before I was caught by the prefect. So I had to let him have it.
How?
Stabbed him with a bayonet. He bled well.
-Did you kill him?
-You bet
It's the same here. Egg head better leave me alone. Mathieu is not the worst.
Are you kidding?
Singing you a lullaby,
Then when you sleep he will come and touch you. This type must all be killed.
Good evening, gentlemen
-Have a good appetite! -I swear I didn't do anything, sir!
I see you have high-class friends, Corbin
Get out!
This feast I just witnessed will be our secret. Gift to you.
But I warn you,
Don't speak to Pepinot, don't approach him
Don't even look at him, is that clear?
A single look towards him and I'll turn your life into a nightmare
-What are you doing here, Morange?
I must have heard voices
Article 8 of school regulations:
students are not allowed into classrooms alone
If it were Mr. Rachin, you would have to write it a 100 times for tomorrow. Plus what he would tell your mother.
I don't care about my mother -What did she do, tell me!
-I have nothing to tell you
Wait! I'm not finished.
You won't get off that easily.
Nothing is free here, ask Pepinot
Your problem, Morange, is that you do things that are unlike you.
Run away, get into fights, play truant It may amuse the others, but not me.
I won't play your little game. From tomorrow, compulsory choir practice.
And daily music class.
Go, go to sleep
Go
March 3
He cannot know, but I am sure of it. His voice is a miracle
The rare promise of an exceptional musical gift.
You can go now, keep quiet
Keep quiet!
Gradually, as my choir gets better I domesticate my new student.
Ok, take your calculus notebooks
You are the one who makes the children sing?
Yes, isr Are you complaining?
Oh, no, on the contrary I love music,
-I sometimes myself croon -Do you?
Have a nice day!
Same to you, my dear colleague
Algebra book, page 27
Pierre will come soon -What happened?
-Everything is fine
How about his tooth?
It got better
Did you tell him I dropped by?
-No
-Why?
I preferred not to tell him.
As you know, Pierre is a sensitive child, and talented.
a talent for mischief.
Not only that,
I must talk to you about it
Singing?
Nobody taught him? He has a gift.
It's obvious. Something must be done.
Hello
I'll leave the two of you.
Don't hesitate to come and see me.
I didn't tell your mother you were punished, I told here you were at the dentist. No betrayal.
-I'm told that you sing well? -Yes
The gentleman seems happy with you, is he kind to you?
Not bad
I brought you clean clothes, and I made your favourite chocolate cake.
Are you happy?
April, the children inspire me.
I knew the day would come when my music would be played.
I'm Clement Mathieu, musician, every night, I compose for them.
It was not good, sir?
Yes, good, it was very good.
You bastard!
Go!
What did he do?
He stole my watch. Caught him in my bedroom.
Bringing him to see Rachin. "Action-Reaction" -Where are you taking him?
-Jail! 15 days!
-Wait!
-Wait for what?
He is my only barytone
Mathieu!
-What's the matter, sir?
-I found graffiti in the...
Sorry, sir, just a loose shot
Stand aside!
Mathieu, Chabert,
With me
As the weeks pass, I score new victories.
Leclerc, we are still good friends, ain't we? Of course, why do you ask this?
-5 plus 3?
-53
-Are you sure?
-Of course
Thanks!
Maybe it's only an illusion, but
It seems that even our headmaster is changing
Look, Uncle Maxence
Attention, don't move
Smile
Come on, come out, Mondain!
It's finished, child
Come on!
Chabert, I just met Mr Rachin To tell him that Mathieu's choir is fantastic
-I'm tired
-But you are alawys so tired, alright 29!
And what was his answer?
Get the hell out is what he told me.
Where is Mondain?
Didn't you notice he was missing before the run?
He was at roll call this morning, Headmaster
After that, he...
Good, in this case, I forbid all outside walks until the end of the year.
-Did he take much money?
-All the money, around 200 thousands francs
How do I pay suppliers now?
I should never have accepted him in here.
All this for a damn experiment!
Just like you, with your music
I needed coal delivered for hot water, it will be next week.
I call the police.
What's the matter?
I observe that singing makes them smarter, Mathieu
They make great progress
Headmaster, children have had no warm water for three weeks
Cold water is good for blood circulation.
By the way, Mathieu
No more choir.
-But, Headmaster
-Thanks, Mr. Mathieu
Police station, please
I don't know yet about the choir But for the kids, we can use wood.
We have no firewood at all!
Headmaster's personal storage
Chabert,"Action"-"Reaction"
Chabert surprised me I thought he was Rachin's clone
He actually is a nice man, who believes sports and music are the cements of our society.
With his help, I organize resistance
Our choir becomes a clandestine affair.
No, you always let up at the end of the sentence I'm asking one last time to detach every note clearly.
It's late, we'll work on this tomorrow
We are not doing the second part, sir?
I didn't teach you the solo part
But I learnt it.
You did?
Ok, let's begin
Come on, come out
May 13th, 3pm, Mondain is back
-Where is the money?
-I don't know
-Who stole it?
-I don't know, not me
What's happening?
He is beating him?
For half an hour
Is he mad?
He is wasting his time, the child won't say anything at all
Ok, let's start from the beginning
Where is the money?
Tell me!
Where is the money?
Let go!
Let go!
Calm down!
Calm down!
The child has just confessed, I'll call back the police.
You will get to know another residence, with other wardens and bars.
To avoid depressing the children, we did not tell them about the Mondain affair.
We told them he was sent back to his original school. End of story. A hen
Lays 84 eggs every year Well fed, with good housing, Ventilation and sanitation,
It will lay 150 eggs
How many more eggs can a farm girl obtain if she owns 9 hens?
Nice day?
It's good to have a bit of sun.
Summer days are coming.
You know, Pierre surprises me everyday a bit more
Anyway, I..
I wanted to thank you for what you do for him.
I do it for you as well I mean, if Pierre is good, so will you be...
-Let me wipe it
-It's ok, it's ok
-Just ink, nevermind -You are too much!
Idiot!
What's the matter?
Oh!
Why do you beat him?
Tell me, Bebert
Because he threw ink at you
Can't you shut up?
Pierre, I'm ashamed of you.
Wait!
It's ok!
You have to understand, It's because he is proud of you and you are pretty
Pretty?
I mean, you are unusual comparing with other children's mother
Do you mean that I'm alone?
Me too.
-But you have no children
-No I have sixty
But when they see you, they see the lady of their dreams I mean, the mother they all dreamt about
It's not a dream for Pierre, you are his mother
Like all other children, he doesn't want to share with others
We must get him out of this boarding school where he's wasting his time and send him to music school.
I'd like him to have a real job.
Music is a true career
Provided one has solid grounding. He could go to Lyons Institute of Music,
I'd keep an eye on him so he does not stray.
Even there, you can get a bad teacher
-And then?
-Then, he will become whatever he must.
Alone we can't do anything.
Pierre is an exception. I will do everything in my power so that his talent can bloom. - But it need your help, too
- I see, thanks
No, no!
What's the matter, today?
And you, Boniface, how do you stand?
Do you think we can sing like this?
Stand straight!
Ok, again, start from "So gentle..."
Where is my solo?
What solo?
My solo!
Ah, yes, your solo, no, no solo any more
You have a decent voice, but no one is indispensible.
You sing or not. It does not matter to me.
We can do without you.
Listen, we start...
We start from "Oh, night"
Mathieu!
-You're gonna get a scolding...
-I thought he had gone to town?
Dismissed. Go play outside.
You are a pain, do you know that?
Headmaster, I promise you, homework is finished
Our charity committee heard of your choir
The countess herself writes to me
She and her friends are visiting next sunday They want to listen
It's great!
I mean, it's good
I already see the scene. Simpering, music, why not petit fours since we're at it!
You give me extra work with all these silly things of yours!
But, Headmaster, you will notice that Music has not relaxed discipline.
We have had less problems for quite some time.
Coincidence
I don't believe in coincidences, Headmaster
It looks that way. Who apart from you would tell the foundation about the choir?
It's me
Do you know how to write?
-Uncle Maxence probably thought he was doing a good thing.
-Spare me your explanations
I don't like your ways, Mathieu
I think you don't like much, Headmaster
Mr. Rachin, someone for you in the guest room!
Let's talk about this later
It's for you
Sometimes I think we should have let Mondain strangle him.
Violette was thanking me for what I was doing for her son.
She wanted to talk to me about it privately
And tell me something important.
Rendez-vous at Square Cafe, 20th, 4pm
I wrote a letter to the Lyons Institute of Music
I know the principal there
He kindly answered he would be glad to audition your son, and in case he is admitted, He would help him get a scolarship.
-Things will be easier on that front from now on.
-Is that so?
After I met you, My...my life...
How to say?
-Change totally?
-Exactly!
It's all thanks to you
I could not imagine...
Same here. I had lost hope...
I'm thinking, maybe I'm wrong to go too fast.
Ah, no, trust me, no problem
It's true that you brought me luck.
Luck?
I met someone,
He is an eningeer from Lyons
I met him at the cafe.
He works around here on a bridge project.
Are you ok?
Fine
It's a great opportunity, for you and Pierre.
Don't get upset. I have to run.
I'm love for the three of us to have lunch together one of these days.
You will tell him about Pierre?
Please?
Why not
Ok, goodbye
Goodbye
Thanks for all you've done
Oh, not a word to Pierre for the time being.
Sorry, may I take the chair?
-Of course
Countess, I... glad... flowers.
I did not catch everything, but I get the intention.
Thank you, my child
Countess, please allow me to introduce you to Mr. Mathieu,
Our prefect, who makes our dear children sing.
Countess
Please accept my compliments, sir,
We follow with great interest the humane and sensitive teaching methods of Mr Rachin.
We thank you for your contribution to these methods.
By the way, who came up with the idea for the choir? ...
-Well...
-Mine, Countess, my idea
It is a great pleasure, Countess, to help such an understanding director.
Alright. Make them sing.
Rachin is modest, he doesn't like praise
-That's right
What will you sing, then?
La Nuit, by Rameau, Countess
That must be beautiful
Excuse me, who is the boy standing aside?
Is he being punished?
That boy?
He is an exception
May I begin?
And in the eyes of Morange, who was following my rythm so well, I read many things. Pride, happiness to be forgiven but also something new for him, gratefulness.
First day of summer
Our choir welcomes a new member
Sorry, I missed the link. My mistake.
Go ahead.
Come here, it's important
I was scrubbing the toilet walls to remove graffitis. I lifted a tile and found this
-It's Corbin's harmonica
-And this
At least 200 thousands francs inside
No one knew where your cache was.
Don't tell me you don't know how the money got there.
Do you know Mondain was expelled because he was accused of the theft?
I didn't know
It's true - You did not know.
Now I've told you
What got into you?
What were you gonna do with the money?
If I tell you, you won't repeat?
No
I swear
I wanted to buy...
Buy what?
A hot air balloon
We don't know who stole the money, but it proves that Mondain is innocent
He would never have left without the money. That's obvious.
We will look into it in 2 days time, after I come back.
Mathieu, don't worry too much. If Mondain is not guilty this time, he would have been another time anyway.
Nothing can be done for such people, nothing.
-How about justice?
-He's in the hands of justice now.
Headmaster, wait for me!
-Wait for me!
-Are you leaving too?
I am catching a ride. I am spending my vacation at my sister's.
There is a piano there
Do you know why Rachin goes to Lyons?
I think he needs to discuss the budget with the committee.
-Doesn't he?
-Yes
But actually, his main purpose is to kiss ass for promotion and a medal.
Do you think he will succeed?
Crafty as he is?
He will present an idyllic picture of the school, Hide the terrible things you know, and take credit for the choir's success.
-Success?
-I've heard it, it's very good.
Sir, is it true Langlois and the principal left together?
Yes, Chabert and Carpentier took two weeks, We are masters of the place.
Then there is no course today?
No
-What shall we do?
-Take a nap
No, I have a better idea
Excuse me, you...
-Your medal?
-Yes
The bird is in the nest, Mr. Rachin
I don't know how to thank you Headmaster, call for you...
Excuse me, I...
The fire started from the roof.
The blaze was eating up the sleeping quarters, where the kids were last seen.
Sixty children killed, trapped like rats.
To Rachin His promotion and medal are going up in flames right in front of him.
But suddenly...
After lunch, we got out by the back door near the vegetable garden. So that Mary and the villagers would not see us, then
We went to the Lignon forest
Why did you go there?
We did an orientation game. The kids loved it.
Suffice to say, uncle Maxence, I'm extremely disappointed by your behaviour.
Headmaster, I assume the entire responsibility for this escapade.
Uncle Maxence never stopped trying to talk me out of it.
That's what I call a lack of conviction.
On the other hand, one could say we saved the children's lives.
Well, if you had not left the school unattended, there would have been no fire!
I don't know why I'm still listening to you.
Ok, uncle Maxence, considering your seniority, you will only suffer a suspension.
As for you, Mr. Mathieu, you are fired for breaking the school rules.
If that's what you want, then fire me too!
It's not for you to decide.
Mr. Maxence, thanks for your kindness But I believe children need you very much
Think about the children, since this gentleman never does.
This is your due, here you are
You leave immediately by the 6pm bus.
-I forbid you to see a single one of you pupils. -What do you mean?
Uncle Maxence, make sure of it.
Headmaster, before we part, let me tell you what I think of you
I know, Mathieu
-You are incompetent, cruel. -What about them
-They didn't choose to be here
-Neither did I
I never wanted to be an educator.
And don't tell me you were dreaming of burying yourself in this god forsaken place.
You had other ambitions. Me too.
-You should not take out your failure on the children.
-You think I enjoy playing prison warden?
Someone must do it.
But go ahead, go to Paris
Go knock on the minister's door Hello!
I'm Mathieu, we must use true educators not half wits.
Get in, fight, since you have faith!
Mathieu!
Saint Mathieu!
You're a failed musician, a prefect
Just a small prefect,
What do you do in life, Mr Mathieu?
I'm a prefect, prefect, prefect, prefect, prefect!
You are a madman
I'm so tired, go to hell
On the contrary, I'm leaving it
I had hoped some children would brave the interdiction and come say goodbye, but nothing.
These children's wisdom resembled indifference.
And Morange, anyway...
On the first piece of paper, I see Boniface exquisite handwriting And the one with wrong spelling, should be Pepinot's And the one with music notes, that's Morange.
And this one, that one
Make them stop!
-They've locked the door
At that time, I felt a surge of happiness and optimism.
I wanted to tell the whole world.
But who would have listened?
No one knows who I am
The great artist would soon crash back to earth.
I'm Clement Mathieu, a failed musician, unemployed prefect
I'm Clement Mathieu, a failed musician, unemployed prefect
After that?
He never got around to writing it.
But I, I can tell you
And Pepinot told me. The next day, on my road back to school
My childhood memories came back to me.
After Mathieu was fired, my mother took me back.
We went to Lyons, where I was admitted to the Music School.
Engineer wanted me to be a boarder again, My mother refused And he left us
Chabert, Langlois and uncle Maxence united And denounced Rachin's abusive methods towards the students
Children were questioned, Rachin fired.
Clement Mathieu continued to teach music untill he passed away
He never tried to be famous
All he did, he kept to himself.
To him?
No, not entirely
Mr. Mathieu!
Wait for me
Mr. Mathieu!
Why are you here?
Could you please take me with you?
Oh, I can't do that
You must go back to school, otherwise you will be punished
-Please -Shall we go?
Be right back
I cannot take you away
Go back
Go
Go
Pepinot was right to believe in it. The day Mathieu was fired was a Saturday
The worst thing for a man who spends a lot of time alone is lack of imagination.
Life, which is already boring and repetitive becomes deadly dull when imagination is missing.
Look at this individual with the bow tie. Many would enjoy speculating about his profession and his relationship with these women. I, on the other hand, see only a frivolous man.
I am not a frivolous man. The only frivolous thing I possess is my name Titta Di Girolamo.
Nothing, sir.
- Mr Di Girolamo.
Good morning.
Goodbye.
Bye, Sofia.
Fancy a game?
I'm not up to playing a game I can only solve crosswords.
Shame! I get so bored on these business trips.
I'm just back from a convention by the seaside in Mexico.
Now, instead, I'm here in the cold.
Let me introduce myself. Letizia.
Di Girolamo.
Here on business?
Mh.
What a life!
What's your line?
I work for a brokerage company.
Really?
Which one?
Moulinex.
You're kidding.
As far as I know, they make blenders.
Come on!
You're not telling the truth.
The truth, my friend, is boring.
I was wicked and immoral and I ruined your life.
You were always honest. That's enough for me.
You know what frightens me most?
Dying of old age. I don't want to.
I want an extraordinary death.
You've got to take this now, Carlo.
Finished already?
I've lost my appetite.
What's happening outside?
Nothing.
You've lost.
How much do I owe?
Ten Francs.
Thank you.
When I used to walk in a casino, the world would stand still.
They'd whisper: "He's here."
"We'll take everything he has." And they did.
- It wasn't exactly like that.
- Yes, it was. Why else would we live in a hotel room that we once owned?
Is "Grabber" a Neapolitan game?
I wouldn't know, I'm from Salerno. It's the only card game I know.
It's a stupid game. Grabber is a children's game. I learned it as a boy, perhaps that's why I like it.
We should never break the ties with our childhood.
- Right, sir?
- Never! Yes.
Well, I mean...
Never, we shouldn't.
- It takes courage.
- To do what?
To die an extraordinary death.
There is a sect whose members are made up of men and women of all social classes, ages, races and religions.
The sect of insomniacs. I'm a member too... and have been for ten years.
People who aren't members often say to those who are:
..."If you can't sleep you can read, watch TV..."
"...study or do something else."
These words are very irritating to members of the insomniac sect.
The reason is simple. Insomniacs have one obsession: ...to sleep.
The ivory and gold statue from the 18th century. The round Venetian chest in solid walnut. The six Louis XV chairs in waxed wood.
The set of sacred scarabs from France.
I don't remember that.
It was white gold. With emeralds, diamonds and little pearls.
- What a shame!
- We'll buy everything back one day.
Stop it, Carlo!
I can't give up hope.
You've got to stop cheating at Grabber.
I'm getting very good, there's nothing to worry about.
Yes, yes...
- Goodnight, Carlo.
- Goodnight, Isabella.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- How are you today?
- Fine.
Did you sleep well?
On time as usual.
- We're in Switzerland, aren't we?
- Mh mh.
Is there a problem?
One of the hotel guests said to me:
..."That guest of yours, Di Girolamo..."
"...it's not true that he's a finance broker."
I said: "What do you mean?".
He told me: "It's something you should look into."
So then I gave him a reply that would have made any hotel manager proud.
Want to hear it?
I'm listening.
I said:
..."Dear sir, Mr Di Girolamo has paid for his room..."
"...punctually each month for the last eight years."
"He doesn't just pay for the room and full board."
"The price of the room includes another service:"
"...discretion."
That's how I answered.
- It was an excellent reply.
- It was, wasn't it!
Nevertheless... I'm still rather curious.
Well...
What is your actual profession?
You're too intelligent to not realise that every man has an unmentionable secret.
Let's do this.
You tell me your darkest, most unmentionable secret and I'll tell you mine.
You'd make a wonderful poker player. Your face never changes.
You're trying to gain time.
I stole a pair of skis. Years ago, in the mountains. Outside a shelter.
Later on, I was going back up and I caught sight of a chap going down on the ski lift.
He was furious.
He had boots and snow shoes, but no skis.
His face was very unpleasant.
I didn't feel guilty at all.
Now it's your turn.
I was 20. I was in the kitchen with my year-old step brother.
I was supposed to check if his food was too hot.
I tried it... it was lukewarm. I discovered something else. It was delicious.
I greedily ate the lot while he cried in desperation. But I think he survived going hungry that day.
- I've really enjoyed myself.
- So have I.
A famous financier said that when someone knows a secret it isn't a secret anymore.
This is my unmentionable secret. And it's not the only one.
Respectable society tends to oversimplify drugs dividing the world into addicts and non-addicts.
It doesn't take into account the many intermediate stages.
Like mine.
I've taken heroin once a week for 24 years.
Only on Wednesday mornings at ten o'clock sharp.
I have never, ever, deviated from this rule.
I can't call myself an addict.
I can't say I'm alien to drug problems.
Once a year I have my blood cleaned thoroughly.
It's a costly procedure.
How long has Nitto Lo Riccio been on the run?
25, 26 years.
I've never met the man who procures my heroin.
I've spoken to him on the phone only once.
His name is Ludovico.
I think it's an unsuitable name for a pusher.
Did you reserve this table?
Excuse us, but we liked this corner so much.
Would you like us to move?
I wouldn't know.
I've got an idea. This table's big enough for the three of us.
- What do you think? - Yes, but I must sit in the corner.
Maria, listen to this.
Whatever he wants can happen!
A fine mess!
That's the advantage of using only one's memories to excite oneself.
You can own memories you can buy even more beautiful ones.
But life is more complicated, human life especially so. A frightening, desperate adventure.
Compared to this vice of formal perfectionism cocaine is nothing but a stationmaster's pastime.
- Nice! But let us return to Sophie.
We became poetic as we admired her being, beautiful and reckless.
The rhythm of her life flowed from different springs than ours.
Ours can only creep along, envious.
This force of happiness, both exacting and sweet that animated her from head to toe, disturbed us. It unsettled us in an enchanting way, but it unsettled us nonetheless.
That's the word.
If you've got nothing to say, why are we on the phone?
I've got a lot to do.
- How are the kids?
- Fine.
- Want to put them on?
- I'll see who's here.
Dad?
- How are you?
- Fine. - What are you doing?
- Practically nothing.
- Good.
- What do you mean?
I'm doing that too.
I'll put Mum on. Thanks for cheering me up.
- Titta?
- Liliana's become rather witty.
- She's sarcastic when she's bored.
- Oh, yes? And when she isn't bored?
She's unbearable.
I've really got to go.
- Giulia...
- What?
Nothing.
- Did you take your lithium?
What shall we do for our golden anniversary?
Sell the painting of the baroness and take that trip to Cambodia that we've been talking about.
We could visit Della Rocca.
Never! It's the only thing I've got left of my mother's.
- Your materialism revolts me.
- Take your lithium.
You're just a horrible petit bourgeois.
One day you won't find that picture anymore.
I'll sell it and go gambling in Monte Carlo.
Try it and you'll end up sleeping under a bridge.
- I'll divorce you.
- I don't want to die here.
I want to do something spectacular.
Anything.
My life was spectacular.
The show's over. Get used to it.
We're old, we'll die here.
If you die first, I'll follow you with a broken heart.
And vice versa. Now, please, take your lithium.
Mr Di Girolamo.
- Mr Di Girolamo! - Yes?
May I ask you a question?
I'm curious.
Go ahead.
Why do you want the money to be counted by hand and not by the machine?
We must never lose faith in our fellow men.
The day that happens will be a bad day.
- FUTURE PLANS:
NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE... - ...THE CONSEQUENCES OF LOVE -
Hi!
- It's your brother, sir.
- Put him on.
No, he's here in person.
Big brother!
- Looking good!
- I can't stand my face being touched.
- Sorry.
- What am I supposed to say?
- Anything. - Make something up, if you want.
- I've not got much imagination.
Fuck, it's no joke talking to you.
I'm always alone. I'm not used to talking.
So take advantage of me.
When did you say you're leaving?
- Already pissed off?
- I was making conversation.
I'm going to the Maldives tomorrow.
They need a surf instructor at a resort for 3 weeks.
- How's Dad?
- He's dead, but doesn't know it yet.
- He'll live for forever.
- You never call him.
Why should I?
To hear him tell me I'm a criminal?
- You've been unlucky, that's all.
- Bad luck doesn't exist.
It's an invention of losers. And the poor.
Anyway he's not doing too well.
He'd like to go back to Salerno, he says Rome's not for him.
- But mum doesn't want to move.
- I always liked your mother. Thanks.
You're beautiful, you know?
I'm going to the Maldives. Why don't you come too?
I don't look good in swimsuits.
Good answer.
When they do that, it usually means they're up for it.
Have you got a girlfriend?
I get it. You haven't.
Remember Dino Giuffrè, our neighbour?
Of course I do.
- You were friends as kids, weren't you?
- He's my best friend.
- You still see him?
- No, and I've not spoken to him in 20 years.
- It's a bit tough to describe him as your best friend then.
- But he is.
I get it, your imaginary friend.
You tell him all the things you don't tell me, in your head.
Dino Giuffrè is my best friend, full stop.
If we were friends once, we're friends for life.
What bullshit!
Anyway I met his sister last week.
- Mh. - Know what she told me?
- Mh.
He doesn't live in Salerno anymore. He works for the electric company.
He repairs power lines in the mountains up north.
When there's a power cut he climbs up and fixes it.
At night too, when it's cold and windy.
- So?
- Isn't that a lousy job?
- It's just a job like any other.
- No, it's not. His life is really shitty.
Want to compare it to being a surf instructor?
- In the Caribbean?
- You were always a superficial man.
You're not even a man. You're just a boy.
- Goodbye, everyone.
- Goodbye. - Bye, dear.
Goodbye.
I've worked here for two years and I greet you every day. You never answer.
Have you, by any chance, realised I exist?
Hello?
Titta, is that you?
You should be more polite to that girl. She's a nice girl.
She's got her problems too. Like me, like you, like everyone.
You think you're the only one with problems?
- Well, are you pleased I came?
- Very.
Liar!
You were always a big liar.
Perhaps sitting at this bar is the most dangerous thing I've done in my life.
Are you Di Girolamo?
Have I done something wrong?
Maybe I made a mistake and didn't realise it?
Well?
Have you come for me?
I'd like to know.
Don't flatter yourself, Di Girolamo.
We've travelled 1,500 km and we're tired.
What do you mean?
You've already asked four questions and in our business one's already too much.
This isn't a quiz show and I'm not your contestant.
So... be a good boy and calm down.
It's him.
Martusciello.
The television doesn't work.
What the fuck do you do without TV?
Ask who it is first.
Who is it?
Me.
- How did it go?
- Well.
Complications?
I got hungry at one point.
Expecting someone?
Now you don't have to ask who it is.
Don't worry, it's my bag.
Niccol, have you figured out where all our work ends up?
In there.
Let's go.
Is one of your boyfriends picking you up today?
What boyfriends?
The ones that wait outside when you finish work.
They're not boyfriends, they're driving instructors.
I take lessons after work.
- I'm getting my license.
- Ah.
That's why you sit in the driver's seat.
I wouldn't have expected you to notice all these things.
Shy people notice everything but they don't get noticed.
They notice everything or just me?
- Last one!
- Last one!
We've got a problem.
The accounts don't balance. There's 100,000 dollars missing.
Could we do a recount using the machine?
What do you think?
Put all the money back into the bag immediately.
Don't say that. It's surely our mistake.
There's obviously a lack of trust between you and I.
Put the money in the bag.
Arrange for my account to be closed immediately.
Let's not rush into things, we'll sort this out.
Sir?
We could do this:
...we'll recount the money. If we reach the same conclusion the bank will compensate the missing 100,000 dollars.
What do you think?
I'd be less offended if you killed my mother.
You're suggesting I accept a charity donation from your bank?
Losing at Grabber to a cheating amateur doesn't mean one isn't capable of carrying out a major bluff.
To achieve good results, the bluff must be followed through.
To an utmost degree.
There's no compromise.
You can't bluff half-way and then tell the truth.
You've got to be ready to run the risk of looking ridiculous.
I'm just waiting for you to put the money back in the bag.
Sir, we didn't notice there were 4 more bundles of 25,000 in the bag.
We must never lose faith in our fellow men.
It was a bad day for you today.
Have the money taken to the vault.
How do they look?
I get it, you prefer the ones I tried before.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
What does that mean?
It means I've stopped losing.
By the way, I've got something to show you.
I've got something to show you too.
It's lovely.
How much does a toy like this cost?
- 100,000 dollars.
- You made a smart move. It'll make you a bit younger.
- It's not mine, it's yours.
- You're kidding?
I've already got a car.
I can't accept a gift like this.
That's what people always say.
You don't get it. To accept this would alter our relationship entirely.
I want to alter our relationship entirely.
You want to buy me?
You can't give a car like this to someone you don't know.
- I do know you.
- Do you?
What do you know about me?
Let's hear it.
What do you want from me?
Stop giving me this mute performance.
It doesn't always work.
You've got to say something.
- Talk!
- What must I say? What can I say in these situations?
I'm a business consultant.
I'll never accept this car.
Why?
Why?
I wanted to see where you live.
- Do you like my room?
- It's a room.
It's my room.
Could you switch on the light?
Why did you come?
I felt guilty.
You felt needed that's why you came.
But I don't need anybody.
In order to accept a gift, I have to know who it's from.
My name's Titta. Di Girolamo.
For 24 years every Wednesday morning at 10 I habitually use heroin.
I've never made an exception, except for tonight.
I was a business consultant ten years ago.
A business consultant... I was someone on the stock exchange.
I negotiated the purchase of an oil tanker.
It's not easy to negotiate an oil tanker purchase.
I invested billions.
I invested for the Mafia too.
I invested 250 billion for them, and lost 220 in two hours.
They realised I hadn't stolen it.
They pardoned me.
They shut me up here in this hotel. Once a week I take a bag containing several million dollars to a bank.
But I'm not affiliated with the Mafia.
I've got a gun, but I've never used it.
I suffer from insomnia.
I separated from my wife ten years ago.
I've got three kids and I call them often but they don't want to talk to me.
I'll be 50 tomorrow. It's my birthday.
And I don't feel tired.
Tomorrow we'll go out of town to celebrate your birthday.
To the mountains.
I'll pick you up in my car at three.
Now get some sleep, you're tired.
If you look me in the face, I'll shoot you.
Well done. Now you've got to tell me a couple of things.
Where are the car keys and what's the code for the alarm?
The keys are in the top drawer of the desk.
The code is 2250.
Good.
When we've gone, call Pippo D'Ant and try and convince him it wasn't you.
- Pippo, it's Di Girolamo.
- What can I do for you?
- They took the bag.
- What the fuck are you saying?
- The two Sicilians who were here a few days ago.
- Are you crazy?
They're my cousins.
They came in and saw another bag arrive.
- Don't talk crap. You've got to come here.
- What for?
To convince Nitto that it wasn't you.
Me?
What've I got to do with it?
Explain that to Nitto.
Ni...
Nitto Lo Riccio?
Well done, you turd. Name names.
If you want to save your neck, come and explain to Nitto.
I've got an appointment, I'll come in two days time.
You haven't got a hope in hell if you don't come right away.
But today isn't the first of the month.
I've never been loved by anyone.
It's Di Girolamo. I'm leaving today at 6:30 p.m.
- We'll get you at the airport.
- Fine.
How will I recognize you?
I haven't seen you in 15 years.
I haven't changed.
This is for you.
It should add up to what you lost in the last few months.
I had to sell something of my mother's.
I want to say something else.
There was no need to humiliate my husband that way. He's an old man.
You could have just stopped playing.
You're an evil person. Goodbye.
- Did someone come for me?
- No, sir.
Messages?
None.
Pippo...
It's Di Girolamo.
I didn't recognize you.
- Where are we going?
- We're already here.
What the fuck are you laughing at, Di Girolamo?
- Nothing. Just thinking.
- What about?
That I can't break free of hotels, isn't it ridiculous?
Ridiculous?
It's ridiculous that you lost a bag containing 9 million dollars.
That's ridiculous.
He's here.
Tell me in a concise statement what happened.
Well... Two people came into the room. They held me at gunpoint and took the bag.
But first they asked for the keys to my car and the code for the alarm.
I gave them both to them.
Then one of them said:
..."Now call Pippo D'Ant and try to convince him it wasn't you..."
"...if you can."
I was scared, then I thought about it. I called Pippo.
I explained the facts. He told me to come here immediately and explain.
He also said it wouldn't be easy to convince you it wasn't me.
I got even more scared. Then I thought about it.
I thought I had to get the bag back right away.
And that's what I did. And now I have it.
So why did you come all the way here?
You could've just gone to the bank, deposited the money and telephoned us to say everything was okay.
It was just a hitch.
There's another hitch. That's why I came.
What hitch?
I don't want to give you the bag.
As you've already understood, Di Girolamo's account must be transferred to someone else.
Do we need Di Girolamo for that?
Give me a telephone and I'll talk to the Swiss.
Fine.
Fine.
Let's get back to us.
Why don't you want to give us the bag?
You stole my life from me so I'm stealing your bag.
I see. But if there's no bag, there's no life.
I know.
You'll tell us where you left the bag.
No. I don't think so.
You know why?
Because you're a good man. And because we're more intelligent than you.
That's true, I was never very intelligent.
What restaurant did you book for tonight?
- At Restelli's.
- Good!
Their food's good.
You need passion, lots of patience, ..
...raspberry syrup And a touch of recklessness.
You need a pound of..
...your own ability, Latin sensuality and a little distance.
That's how you make it, lipstick and chocolate and not to eat them would be a shame.
That's how you do it, over low heat, Stirring, with lots of feeling.
Bloody hell!
I'll be there in two days.
- You know, Nitto's fond of you.
- What?
Nitto's fond of you. When he found out about the missing 100,000 dollars he pretended it was nothing.
And he even believed you when you told that story about the two that took the bag.
And how do you pay him back?
- You're hostile with him.
- He believed me?
If he hadn't believed you Pippo would still be here with us now.
For a while, Pippo was looking for his independence.
Now he's independent.
But Nitto can't pretend nothing's happened over 9 million dollars. You understand that?
Tell us where that fucking bag is and you can start a new life.
The whole Committee has troubled themselves for you. This honour should make you talk. But instead you...
This is how it works.
The crane lowers you down.
When you start to talk, it stops. Otherwise it doesn't stop.
Only one thing's certain.
I know it.
Every now and then, at the top of an electric pylon in the midst of a snowy landscape, against a cold, biting wind Dino Giuffrè stops. Sadness descends upon him and he starts to think.
And thinks that I, Titta Di Girolamo am his best friend.
Stand still.
Eyes to the floor.
Walk on.
TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER
MINISTRY FOR STATE SECURITY
Address him as Captain.
Enter.
Sit down.
Hands under your thighs, palms down.
What do you have to tell us?
I've done nothing.
I know nothing.
You've done nothing, know nothing...
You think we imprison people on a whim?
No...
If you think our humanistic system capable of such a thing, that alone would justify your arrest.
We'd like to jog your memory, prisoner number 227.
On September 28th, Dieter Pirmasens, your friend and neighbor, fled to the West. We believe that he had help.
I know nothing.
He didn't even tell me he wanted to leave.
I first heard about it at work.
Please recount, what you did on September 28th.
-It's in my statement.
-Tell me again.
I was at Treptow Park Memorial with my children.
Where I met my old friend Max Kirchner.
We went to his place and listened to music until late.
He has a telephone, you can call him to confirm this.
I can give you the number.
The enemies of ourstate are arrogant.
Remember that.
It takes patience.
Fast forward...
I want to sleep.
Please, let me sleep!
Hands under your thighs.
Tell me again what you did on September 28th.
Please, just one hour...
Just a little... A little sleep.
Tell me again what you did on that day.
Why keep him awake for so long?
It's inhuman.
An innocent prisoner will become more angry by the hour due to the injustice suffered.
He will shout and rage. A guilty prisoner becomes more calm and quiet... Or he cries.
He knows he's there for a reason.
The best way to establish guilt or innocence is non-stop interrogation. ...school friend Max Kirchner.
We went to his place and listened to music until late.
He has a telephone, you can call him to confirm this.
Do you notice anything about his statement?
It's the same as at the beginning.
Exactly the same. Word for word
People who tell the truth can re-formulate things, and they do. A liar has prepared sentences which he falls back on when under pressure.
227 is lying.
We have two important indicators and can increase the intensify.
If you don't give names, we'll have to arrest your wife.
Jan and Nadja will be put into state care.
Is that what you want?
Who was the person who helped him flee?
-Glueske...
-Again!
Speak clearly!
-Glueske...
Werner Glueske.
-Werner Glaske
Quiet!
Quiet!
Listen!
Does anyone know what that is?
It's the odor sample for the dogs.
It must be collected at every interrogation. Never forget it!
Your subjects are enemies of socialism.
Never forget that!
Good-bye.
That was good, really good.
You remember how we sat there 20 years ago?
They've offered me a professorship.
Life's not about good grades, though mine weren't that bad, thanks to you.
So what's up?
Why do you always think I'm scheming?
-I wanted to invite you to the theater.
-The theater?
I heard that Minister Hempf is going.
As head of the Culture Department, I should show my face.
It starts at 7:00 p.m. We should get going.
THE LIVES OF OTHERS
Minister Hempf at 1:00.
He used to be in State Securify, you know.
He really cleaned up the theater scene.
Georg Dreyman, the writer. Georg Dreyman, the writer.
An arrogant type, the kind I warn my students about.
But he's loyal.
If they were all like him,
I'd be out of a job.
He's our only non-subversive writer who is also read in the West.
He thinks the GDR is the greatest country on earth.
See for yourself.
-What's wrong, my child?
A new vision?
-Speak, Marta!
-Speak!
-Your Arthur...
-Is dead.
-Arthur?
Can't you be wrong, just this once?
No, sister.
Believe me.
He fell to his death.
Crushed by the mighty wheel.
I see it, though I'd rather see any other horror.
Why am I not spared these visions?
Elena!
Go home and mourn.
Did you like it?
-Dreyman's good, huh?
-I'd have him monitored.
Monitored?
All that teaching is ruining your instincts.
-I could oversee it myself.
-He's clean, I tell you.
Even Hempf likes him. We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot.
I'm going down.
FACES OF LOVE
I hear a lot about your work.
They say culture's in good hands. Your name is mentioned
-in Party circles.
-We're the Party's "shield and sword."
I'm aware of that at all times.
What do you make of him?
Of Georg Dreyman?
Maybe...
Maybe what?
Maybe he's not as clean as he seems.
Grubitz!
That's why you and I are on top.
Your average Stasi chump would have said,
"One of our best!
So loyal!" etc.
But we can see more.
You're heading to the very top, Grubitz.
There's something fishy about him. I can feel it in my gut.
Dreyman's having a party next week. Some dubious types are going...
Hauser and that rabble. Try to wire the place discreetly by then.
Measures A and B. Only in his rooms.
Nothing conspicuous. He has powerful friends.
No one is to know about this until we've found something.
But if you get something on him, you'll have a good friend in the Central Committee.
You understand what I'm saying?
Have a nice evening, Comrade Minister.
Why is he staring at us?
What's he doing here, anyway?
I think he's got a crush on you.
I can't let the evening pass without raising a toast to our artists. A great Socialist,
I can't recall who it was, once said,
"Writers are engineers of the soul."
So Georg Dreyman is one of our country's greatest engineers.
-What charming bedfellows you have.
-Paul!
And to Christa-Maria Sieland, the loveliest pearl of the GDR.
Let's raise our glasses to Christa-Maria Sieland.
Three cheers to her.
Someone like him doesn't even deserve to address you.
Stay with me!
And now something for the soul.
May I?
-How did you like my speech?
-Many thanks. I liked your play, too.
-Really, it was good. -"Engineers of the soul."
-That was a Stalin quote.
-Really?
I, too, like to provoke, Mr. Hauser.
But unlike you, I know how far I can go.
I'm more like our dear Dreyman.
He knows that the Party needs artists, but that artists need the Party even more.
If you're going to talk politics, I'll find another dance partner.
-I'm willing.
-Too late!
-I folow our theater with interest.
-It used to be theater people...
Paul!
It's okay, I've known Mr. Hauser for years. Comrade Schwalber!
You did a good job tonight, too.
Dreyman, I'm glad you're working with such directors. It wasn't always so.
You're referring to Jerska?
I think you judged him too harshly.
Sure, he went too far in what he said.
Without a doubt.
But put yourself in his shoes for a moment.
You, as a man of honor.
He can't remove his name from that statement.
He could work for any theater in the West. But he wants to stay here. Because he believes in socialism and in this country.
-His blacklisting is...
-Blacklisting?
We don't do that here!
You should choose your words more carefully.
Comrade Hempf, just between us, my plays are not strong enough to survive Schwalber's direction.
I need Jerska, and I think you judged him too harshly.
Well, I don't. But that's what we all love about your plays.
Your love for mankind, your belief that people can change.
Dreyman, no matter how often you say it in your plays, people do not change!
How is he, by the way?
He hopes that his black... That he can work again soon.
-Is he right in hoping?
-Of course he is.
As long as he lives, and even longer.
Because as you know, Dreyman, hope always dies last.
The team will be ready to wire the place as of tomorrow.
It needs to be finished by Thursday.
Think you can do it?
Good night.
...and land for chicken farmers, but used in an efficient way...
The 10th Party Conference economic policy is solid.
Now more than ever, the...
-I'll get in trouble if I don't go.
-With who?
My girlfriend.
Girlfriend?
-All right, then.
-Come on, let's play!
Twenty minutes.
-Yes?
-Frau Meineke, one word of this to anyone, and Masha loses her spot at the university.
-Is that understood?
-Yes.
Send Mrs. Meineke a gift for her cooperation.
It must be Thursday again.
Time passes so quickly...
Perhaps that's a good thing.
-How are you?
-Not bad.
It's not always this noisy.
Only on Thursdays, I know.
Yes.
We missed you at the premiere.
Did Schwalber do a good job?
-His good bits were stolen from you.
-That keeps my ideas alive.
I can't bear those fat, dressed-up people at premieres anymore.
Doesn't sound like me, does it?
But maybe this is the real me, not the old Jerska.
He was friendly and caring, nourished by success, all thanks to the grace of the bigwigs.
But I won't complain much longer.
In my next life, I'll simply be an author. A happy author who can write whenever he wants.
Like you.
What is a director if he can't direct?
He's a perfectionist without a film, a miller without corn. He is nothing.
Nothing at all.
Albert, the Minister was at the premiere. Minister Hempf.
I spoke to him about your blacklisting.
It looks promising.
He gave me hope, concrete hope. Literally.
Really?
That's great.
Cheap Georgian wine.
Chateau Jerska.
So is our holy drinker coming?
I forget to ask him.
You're strong and forceful.
That's how I need you. Don't let this blackness into your life.
Albert is my friend.
-And you're my boyfriend.
-Look's like a 50th.
But I'm going to be 40, right?
Don't forget, you promised to wear a tie for your birthday.
I would, but I don't have one.
Bon anniversaire!
A tie?
You said you didn't want any books.
Or can't you tie a tie, you old working-class poet?
What?
I was born wearing a tie!
I had to "fight my way out of my middle-class fetters
Then put those getters on again, just for me.
All right...
It's no big deal to tie a tie.
Frau Meineke, would you come in for a moment!
Can you tie a tie?
You've no idea how thankful I am.
Are you feeling unwell?
No...
I'm feeling fine.
Finished?
Wonderful.
It's perfect.
It couldn't be better.
It'll be our secret. You can keep a secret, right?
Of course.
I'll be damned!
And I thought you couldn't do it.
You don't normally hide your talents.
You've no idea of the things I can do!
The first guest.
Our dear neighbors locked the main door again.
Can you go?
Yes, I'm going.
Maestro!
Our humble offerings.
I expressly said no books!
But thanks.
Have a look first.
-Would you like a drink?
-A soda.
-Vodka for me.
-I'll get it.
-Why the hell's Albert sitting all alone?
-He won't talk to us.
He sent us all away.
I brought you something, too.
Did you really come here to read?
It is Brecht!
I feel like a fraud among these people. A fraud?
Come off it, Albert!
You're losing your grip on reality.
You know how we admire you, how everybody admires you.
For something I did 10 years ago
and could probably never do again.
My favorite director! Wait!
I need to talk to you a moment.
Tell me again how you got into this position.
Pure talent.
Of course!
But what else did you have to do?
Everyone knows you're with the Stasi!
What an outrageous insinuation!
-Paul!
-What?
Excuse myfriend, he's had too much to drink.
-But you know he's with the Stasi!
-No, Paul.
I don't know that.
You're such an idealist that you're almost a bigwig.
It was informers and conformists like that who ruined Albert.
If you don't take a stand, you're not human!
If you ever want to take action, call.
If not, we don't have to meet again.
-Your friends don't have much taste.
-That's really unfair.
Here!
-Look at this beautiful back scratcher.
-That's a salad fork. Still, it's beautiful...
And look at this.
-I'll write my new play with this.
-You have no taste either!
I do in some things.
It's from Jerska.
So he did give you a book!
SONATA FOR A GOOD MAN
11:04 p.m. "Lazlo" and CMS unwrap presents. Then presumably have intercourse.
You're late.
Sorry, Captain.
Those red lights made me lose all of four minutes.
You know how it is.
They're already at it!
Unbelievable!
These artists!
They're always at it!
That's why I prefer monitoring artists to priests or peace activists.
See you tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.
Albert Jerska, Operation "Engerling."
Systematic as usual, Wiesler.
The files will be sent.
Let's have lunch.
The BSG volleyball team will meet at 7:00 p.m.
Did you forget?
Bosses sit over there.
Socialism must start somewhere.
About the license plate of the car that brought Ms. Sieland home...
It's Minister Hempf's car.
Wiesler, we can't monitor top officials.
I removed the entry in your report. Nothing written from now on, just oral!
So we're helping a Committee member get a rival out of the way.
You know what this could mean for my career. And for yours. If we find something...
Is that why we joined?
You remember the oath we took?
-"We are the Party's shield and sword."
-What is the Party, if not its members?
And if those members are highly influential, all the better!
I've got a new one.
Honecker comes into his office, opens the window, sees the sun, and says...
What's wrong?
Oh, excuse me...
I just...
No, carry on, colleague!
No harm in laughing about the Party Chairman, is there?
I probably know the joke anyway.
Come on, tell us!
Well...
I mean, the Comrade General Secretary sees the sun and says, "Good morning, dear sun!"
More like, "Good morning, dear sun!"
The sun replies, "Good morning, dear Erich!" And at noon,
Erich goes to the window and says, "Good day, dear sun!"
The sun replies, "Good day, dear Erich!" In the evening, Erich says again,
"Good evening, dear sun!" and the sun doesn't reply.
"Good evening, dear sun..."
"What's wrong?" he asks.
And the sun replies, "Screw you, I'm in the West now!"
Name?
Rank?
Department?
Me?
Stigler.
Second Lieutenant Axel Stigler. Department M.
I don't have to tell you what this means for your career.
Please, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, I was just...
You were just deriding the Party!
That's incitement, and likely just the tip of the iceberg!
I will report this to the Minister's office.
Just kidding!
Good one, huh?
But yours was good, too. I know a better one, though.
What's the diffrence between Honecker and a phone?
None at all.
Hang up, try again!
-Are you coming, too?
-No, I have to get home.
Bye.
Cold?
Christa, you forget our meeting on Thursday.
Or did your poet have two birthdays in a row?
Come on, get in.
Get in!
You don't know what's good for you.
Don't worry.
I'm looking after you.
Tell me you don't need it, too.
Just say so, and I'll let you go.
I'm meeting someone.
Where do you think we're going?
I'm taking you to him!
You'll be there even quicker.
Time for some bitter truths.
Yes?
Those idiots!
Next Thursday at the Metropol.
Drive!
Christa?
Just hold me.
Good evening, Comrade!
You're five minutes late again.
Evening. 11th floor, right corridor.
I'm already up here.
How did you get into the building?
A bunch of you guys live here.
I don't think I've been here before.
No, I don't think you have.
Well?
Was that nice?
Stay a while.
I can't, my next customer is at half past.
I work on a schedule.
At 1:30?
-You won't make it.
-Sure I will. Don't you worry.
Book me for longer next time.
Bye.
Georg?
-Did you hear about Hauser?
-No, what happened?
He can't get a travel permit for his lectures in the West.
Are you surprised?
If he acts so arrogantly, he should expect it.
Would you let him go, if you were in their position?
CMS comes home.
"Lazlo" approves of Hauser's foreign travel ban.
-Have you seen my Brecht book?
-What?
My Brecht book.
I don't know where it is.
Strange. I could've sworn...
One day in blue-moon September, silent under a plum tree,
I held her, my silent pale love, in my arms like a fair and lovely dream.
Above us in the summer skies was a cloud that caught my eye.
It was white and so high up.
And when I looked up, it was no longer there.
-Yes?
-Georg?
Wallner here.
What's up?
Georg, it's about Jerska.
He hanged himself last night.
Georg?
I'm going to hang up, okay?
You know what Lenin said about Beethoven's Appassionata.
"If I keep listening to it, I won't finish the revolution."
Can anyone who has heard this music,
I mean truly heard it, really be a bad person?
Are you really with the Stasi?
Do you even know what the Stasi is?
Yes. They're bad men who put people in prison, says my dad.
I see.
What's the name of your...
My what?
Ball!
What's the name of your ball?
You're funny!
Balls don't have names.
It's all in place, Minister.
The latest technology.
Behind every light switch, even in the toilet.
-Measure C in the hall...
-You said you'd find something!
Find something!
I'd advise even my worst enemy not to disappoint me.
Now get out of here.
Nowack, you're to watch Christa-Maria.
You'll report on ervery minute that she's not with me.
We revoked Hauser's travel permit for the culture conference.
Maybe that'll lead to something.
The two of them are very close.
How's it going between CMS and the Minister?
They're meeting tomorrow night, I think.
That's good. Very good.
We have a lot to gain from this love story.
Or a lot to lose.
Don't forget that.
I used to be afraid of just two things:
Being alone, and not being able to write.
Since Albert's death, I don't care about writing or about other people.
All I'm afraid of now is losing you.
You needn't be afraid tonight.
-I'm just going out for a few hours.
-Where to?
An old classmate's in town.
Really, Christa?
Really?
How dare you.
I know.
I know where you're going.
And I'm asking you not to go.
You don't need him.
You don't need him.
I know about your medication, too. And how little faith you have in your talent.
Have faith in me, at least.
Christa-Maria.
You are a great artist.
I know that.
And your audience knows it, too.
You don't need him.
You don't need him.
Stay here.
Don't go to him.
No?
Don't I need him?
Don't I need this whole system?
What about you?
Then you don't need it either.
Or need it even less.
But you get in bed with them, too.
Why do you do it?
Because they can destroy you, too, despite your talent and your faith.
Because they decide what we play, who is to act, and who can direct.
You don't want to end up like Jerska. And neither do I.
That's why I'm going now.
You're right about so many things, and I want to change so much.
But I ask you, I implore you, don't go.
Well, boss, am I on time?
Let me guess what those two are doing...
Bang, bang, bang!
Come on, I'll take over.
I don't want you to do overtime because of me.
"Don't go through that door."
Where's she going?
To meet an old classmate.
You'll have my detailed report tomorrow. I can manage.
Good night.
What are you staring at?
Soda water.
No...
Vodka.
Double.
Another one.
Can I have a cognac, please?
Madam?
Go away, I want to be alone.
Ms. Sieland.
Do we know each other?
You don't know me, but I know you.
Many people love you for who you are.
-Actors are never "who they are."
-You are.
I've seen you on stage.
You were more who you are
than you are now.
So you know what I'm like.
I'm your audience.
I have to go.
Where to?
I'm meeting an old classmate. I...
You see?
Just now you weren't being yourself.
No?
No.
So you know her well, this Christa-Maria Sieland.
What do you think...
Would she hurt someone who loves her above all else?
-Would she sell herself for art?
-For art?
You already have art. That'd be a bad deal.
You are a great artist.
Don't you know that?
And you are a good man.
When I began my shift, "Lazlo" and CMS are arguing about whether CMS should meet her classmate(?
Eventually, she leaves.
"Lazlo" seems unhappy about this.
But after about 20 minutes, CMS returns to "Lazlo's" surprise, and mine.
He seems very happy about this.
Vigorous acts of intimacy follow.
She says she'll never leave again.
He says repeatedly,
"Now I'll have the strength, now I'll do something."
This likely refers to writing a new stage play.
In recent weeks, "Lazlo's" playwriting had been plagued by difficulties.
What she means by her statement is unclear.
Perhaps she intends to take better care of his household.
The rest of the night was peaceful.
Oh, Comrade... It's just because... He's sleeping, too...
Good report.
Really?
I didn't know he was in such a bad way.
Neither did I.
"On One Who Made it to the Other Side."
The statistics office on Hans Beimler Street counts everything, knows everything.
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.
How many books I read a year: 3.2.
And how many pupils graduate with straight A's every year:
6347.
But there is one thing they don't count, maybe because even bureaucrats find it painful, and that's suicides.
If you call Beimler Street to ask how many people between the Elbe and the Oder, between the Baltic Sea and the Ore Mountains, despair drove to their death, our numbers oracle is silent.
But it may just note your name for State Security, those gray men who ensure safety in our land and happiness.
In 1977, your country stopped counting suicides.
They called them "self murderers." But it has nothing to do with murder.
It knows no bloodlust, no heated passion.
It knows only death, the death of all hope.
When we stopped counting, only one country in Europe drove more people to their death:
Hungary.
We came next, the land of "Real Existing Socialism."
One of the uncounted is Albert Jerska, the great director.
It's him I want to talk about today...
I tried to get statistics that show that...
That State Securify operates more effectively we think.
I foolishly rehearsed my speech for the West in here.
Since then, I've become very musical.
We can meet at my place.
3:00 P.M. PANKOW MEMORIAL
Well?
Is this safe enough?
My own "bodyguard." I call him Rolf.
That's probably his name, too.
Fire away.
Here.
You want to publish this?
In the West, with your help.
Will you help?
Have you told Christa?
No.
I'll help you, as long as you don't tell her anything.
-What?
-Georg, it's for her own protection.
This could be right for the Spiegel. I'm friends with an editor there.
Gregor Hessenstein.
Know him?
-Not personally.
-You have to meet him.
But you can't publish using your real name.
Unless your idea of fun is a 48-hour interrogation.
I'm cold.
We could go to my place?
There's no State Securify at my place. A friend of Margot Honecker, winner of the National Award...
-Second class.
-My apartment is clean, I tell you.
If only we could be sure...
I have an idea how we can check your apartment.
You know my Uncle Frank who visits from West Berlin every Saturday with his big gold Mercedes.
It seems a bit risky to me, Mr. Hauser.
Yes, I agree with Georg.
Hiding your nephew under the back seat?
I'm really not sure.
Come on, they won't search under the seats.
They'll look under the axles, tap the exhaust, then I'll be across.
Paul, too.
The border guards aren't very bright.
You've got the wrong idea there.
Which border will you cross?
Heinrich-Heine Street. Always Heinrich-Heine Street.
They know me and my gold Mercedes.
I'm friends with the guards.
Trust me, I'll call you in two hours, a Schultheiss beer in my hand and report the news:
Paul's across.
No!
-What about Paul's Stasi man?
-Rolf.
Rolfy, Rolfy...
He'll think that Paul's at home.
Okay, I have to go. We wouldn't want him to suffocate, would we?
It'd be a shame.
Okay, take care!
Heinrich-Heine Street
Another beer?
Border control, Heinrich-Heine Street.
Who is this?
Who is this?
No reply.
Just this once, my friend.
-Dreyman.
-Okay, Paul's plan worked!
-No border control at all?
-No.
No special checks.
Those boys aren't so bad. It worked as planned.
Thanks for doing this, Mr. Hauser.
Forget it, it wasn't all that dangerous.
Yeah, true.
See you soon, and thanks a lot.
Bye.
What do we do if they ask what we're doing together?
Then... We'll say...
We'll say we're writing a stage play together.
For the GDR's 40th anniversary.
Yes.
And it's kind of true.
Who'd have thought our State Security was so incompetent?
Who'd have thought they were such idiots?
Just you wait... 7:32 p.m.
No futher noteworthy incidents.
Hello, Comrade.
Listen to this here.
Sure, in 1967 there were many suicides.
But why in 1977? You must explain.
You must describe the social conditions more clearly.
It should remain literature, not political agitation.
The text is great.
I just want to be sure people understand it in the West.
It'll cause a sensation either way.
-That's Hauser.
-Of course it's Hauser.
He's not in the West.
They're writing a play together.
For the 40th anniversary.
It doesn't sound like a play to me.
No?
Then what?
I don't know, but not a play.
You think a lot, Sergeant Leye.
-You're not an intellectual, are you?
-Me?
No...
-I'm not one of those.
-Then don't behave like one.
I chose you because you know the equipment and don't ask questions.
-Leave the thinking to your superiors.
-Yes, Captain.
I'll be off, then.
Have a nice day of work...
I mean, I hope you enjoy your work.
Maybe I can rewrite this part.
I'll send you all the material we have.
Can you do it in two weeks?
Then I could run it as a cover story for the first week in March.
It's Christa.
Georg?
Christa, this is Gregor Hessenstein.
-Christa Sieland.
-Of course, I know that.
So, what conspiracy are you cooking up?
Hauserand I are writing a play
-for the GDR's 40th anniversary.
-Together?
The Spiegel may do an article on it.
-And who'll play the lead role?
-We planned to ask you.
Christa, who would you rather play:
Lenin or his dear old mother?
You can choose.
I see I'm not welcome here. I'll go for a nap.
Your caution is praise worthy. The fewer people know, the better. The Stasi is not to be toyed with.
On that note, I brought something for you.
I'd have prefferred the whole pie. I already have a typewriter.
The Stasi can identify its fypeface.
If they intercepted the text at the border, you'd end up in Hohenschoenhausen.
And that's no fun, as Paul can confirm, right?
I'm afraid I could only get a red ink ribbon for this model.
-Do you mind writing it in red?
-That won't be a problem.
Is there somewhere you can hide it?
-Yes, I'll find a place.
-Don't take it lightly.
I don't want my next article to be about your disappearance!
Nobody may know that this typewriter exists!
-Is this apartment really safe?
-Yes.
It's the only place left in the GDR where I can say what I want.
Fine, then let's drink to that.
This is the real stuff.
To you.
To letting all of Germany see the true face of the GDR.
Cheers.
It's better than the Russian stuff.
To your success.
-I must see Comrade Grubitz. -Out of the question.
-Do you know what we've invested...
-Tomorrow at 2:30 p.m...
Tell him that if he blows the cover, we'll shut down the entire parish!
He can call the Pope and complain!
Okay, I've spent enough time on this nonsense.
Wiesler, I'm glad you're here.
I have to show you something.
"Prison Conditions for Subversive Artists.
"Based on Character Profile." Pretty scientific, eh?
And look at this.
"Dissertation Supervisor: A. Grubitz." That's great, isn't it?
I only gave him a B.
They shouldn't think getting a doctorate with me is easy.
But this is first-class.
Did you know that there are just five types of artists?
Your guy, Dreyman, is a Type 4.
A "hysterical anthropocentrist."
Can't bear being alone, always talking, needing friends.
That type should never be brought to trial. They thrive on that.
Temporary detention is the best way to deal with them.
Complete isolation and no set release date.
No human contact the whole time, not even with the guards.
Good treatment, no harassment, no abuse, no scandals, nothing they could write about later.
After 10 months, we release.
Suddenly, that guy won't cause us any more trouble.
Know what the best part is?
Most Type 4s we've processed in this way never write anything again.
Or paint anything, or whatever artists do...
And that without any use of force.
Just like that.
Kind of like a present.
What brings you here?
-Developments with Dreyman?
-That's why I'm here.
I think the time has come...
For what?
For us to slim down the operation.
I don't want to run day and night shifts
-for such an uncertain case.
-Uncertain, huh?
You don't think we'll find anything for the Minister?
Maybe if we're more flexible. If we watch "Lazlo" outside his own four walls.
Shall I give the case to Udo?
I'd like to continue it myself.
-Why?
-It could produce results.
I just need to plan more flexibly.
When I come and go, days and nights...
Maybe he's up to something outside.
Something doesn't feel right here.
There's something you're hiding.
All right, I'll take Udo off the case.
I can use him for this church case. Give me a request in writing.
Write as a reason, "Lack of suspicious acts."
And, Wiesler!
A piece of advice for you:
We're not at school anymore.
Projects aren't about grades, but success.
"The state statistics office counts everything, knows everything.
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3. How many books I read a year: 3.2.
And how many pupils graduate with straight A's every year: 6347
5:00 p.m. "Lazlo" reads the first act of his anniversary play to Hauserand Wallner.
DENTAL PRACTICE
-We're not writing a play, Christa.
-You don't have to tell me.
-But I want to.
It's a text...
-Don't tell me.
Maybe I am as unreliable as your friends say.
But I...
I'm with you now. No matter what.
Minister Riesenhuber, author of the report, said there is no quick fix for saving damaged forests.
East-West German relations under strain.
Spiegel magazine today published a text by an unnamed East German author about suicide in the German Democratic Republic. This follows a series of suicides by prominent East-Berlin artists, the latest being Albert Jerska.
After being blacklisted for seven years, Jerska committed suicide on January 5th.
In 1977, the GDR ceased publishing any data relating to suicides.
That year, Hungary was the only country in Europe with a higher suicide rate.
Yes, sir...
You failed miserably, Grubitz, you incompetent amateur!
General, our man at the Spiegel got us a Photostat of the original.
Congratulations!
So who wrote it?
He doesn't know, but using the typeface, we'll...
You're hopeless!
Get me names!
I will, as soon as we get the results.
If not, you'll be put against the wall.
Andrea, where's the graphologist?
Thus I conclude that it is a domestic typewriter, produced for export, most likely a "Kolibri" travel model, made by the VEB Groma.
If the ink were black, I could be more precise.
-Who owns such a typewriter?
-There are none registered in the GDR.
What does that mean?
What does Hauser use?
Paul Hauser uses a "Valentino" typewriter, made by Olivetti.
That model has a more horizontal...
Yes, yes!
And Wallner?
He writes on an Optima "Elite."
-Georg Dreyman?
-He writes his first drafts by hand, then types them up on a Wanderer "Torpedo."
He's never used anything else.
How big is this Kolibri typewriter?
It's one of the smallest available:
10.5 cm x 9 cm x 10.5 cm.
So it's as easy to smuggle as a book.
Thank you. You may go.
Goodbye, Comrade.
GDR THE SECRET SUICIDE STATISTICS
Andrea, put me through to Wiesler. 4:00 p.m. The group is exhausted 4:00 p.m. The group is exhausted from so much writing.
STAFF INTERNAL
-Yes?
-Have you heard about this article?
-In the Spiegel?
Yes.
-How so?
Hauser called Dreyman and told him about it.
Wiesler, this is very important. Both for my career and for yours.
Did he mention who may be behind it?
Or do you have any ideas?
I don't think he mentioned anything.
No, nothing at all.
A Spiegel editor crossed the border using a false name on the 27th and spent four hours here.
Real name: Gregor Hessenstein.
Department VI followed him to Prenzlauer Berg, then lost his trail.
Did he have contact with Dreyman?
-Wouldn't I have noted it in the report?
-Yes, of course.
But I smell a writer behind this text.
I'd be astonished if I'm wrong.
So keep your ears open.
Get in.
If one of your staff deceives you, you punish him, right?
-Sure, sure!
-Even a woman,
-right?
-But of course.
Isn't everyone who serves a great man part of his staff?
You could see it like that...
Indeed, you'd have to see it like that.
This is where she gets her illegal medication. Christa-Maria Sieland.
You should know this, it's your department.
It's up to you whether you ruin her or not, but I never want to see her on a German stage again.
Now get out.
Shut the door!
Ms. Sieland?
Please follow us.
We have some questions.
Come along.
So...
Comrade Sieland, a beautiful career you had, huh?
A pity really.
You were good.
You were very good indeed.
Just too short-lived.
Do have a seat.
What do actors do when they can't act anymore?
Please...
Isn't there anything I can do for you?
For...
State Security?
It's a little late for that.
I know nearly all our artists.
-I could find out a lot.
-I believe you.
But it won't help you now.
Maybe there's something else I could do?
Something we might both find agreeable.
Unfortunately, you've made an enemy of a very powerful man.
Therefore, I have less freedom than would normally be the case.
Is there no way I can save myself?
I'm sorry, madam.
There is one possibility.
Since you spend so much time with writers and artists...
You don't know anything about an article from this week's Spiegel, do you?
An article about suicide.
State Securify!
Open the door!
Open up!
He's turned on the light in his study.
Go in before he destroys any evidence.
Crowbar!
I don't think that'll be necessary.
What's the matter, Comrades?
We have a warrant to search the premises.
-What are you looking for?
-It's confidential.
Boysen, Mueller: bedroom. Greska: kitchen, bathroom, hall.
Heise and Thomas: living room, study.
Go!
What do you burn in here?
Substandard texts.
A lot of Western literature, huh?
That book was a gift from Margot Honecker.
-Status?
-All according to plan.
We found nothing, except Western books and newspapers.
No trace to be found.
Did you search thoroughly?
Yes, Comrade.
What's our next move?
Comrade?
Pull out your men.
In the unlikely event that damage has occurred, you may claim compensation.
I'm sure everything's in perfect order.
Yes?
Wiesler, I'll be expecting you in Hohenschoenhausen at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Okay, I'll say what we're all thinking:
It was Christa-Maria.
The Stasi got her, and she ratted on you.
It wasn't her.
How can you be so sure?
You yourself said she wasn't home last night.
She knows the hiding place.
Yes, she knows.
So if you're right, and the search was due to her, then she's our guardian angel.
I'm here to see Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz. Captain Wiesler.
Interrogation Room 76.
Yes!
Come in.
Sit down.
So?
What was that about?
You're asking me what that was about?
What do you suspect Dreyman of?
He wrote the Spiegel article.
Who alleges that?
Come with me.
Here.
I don't know how you could be so sloppy as to miss all of this.
But I know you differently, especially as an interrogator.
So I'm giving you one last chance.
Bring in prisoner 662, now.
Are you still on the right side?
-Yes.
-Then don't screw it up again.
Shall I restrain the prisoner?
No, she's an informant now. You may go.
So you're my commanding officer?
Write.
Then command me.
In another 10 hours...
No, in nine and a half...
Mr. Roessing will tell the audience that you, for health reasons, cannot appear.
And that will be your last mention in the acting world.
Is that what you want?
Tell us where the evidence is hidden.
There is no evidence, and no typewriter.
I made it all up.
I hope not.
If so, we'll have to keep you here. A false statement is perjury, which carries around two years in prison.
Dreyman will go to prison anyway on account of your statement
and the material we've already found in the apartment.
Save yourself, at least.
You have no idea how many people are in jail here for senseless heroics.
Don't forget audience.
"Don't forget audience." He has some funny ideas.
Don't forget what the state has done for you... Your whole life long.
Now you can do something for the state.
And it will thank you.
Tell me where the typewriter's hidden.
Dreyman will never find out.
I'll let you go immediately, and we'll strike only after you're back with him.
You'll manage to feign surprise, I'm sure.
And tonight you'll be back on stage.
In your element. In front of your audience.
Tell me where the documents are.
Where are they?
They're in the apartment.
Under the doorsill, between the living room
and the hallway.
You can remove it.
Is this where you mean?
Mark the exact place with a cross.
You look worn out.
Remember, you're an informant now.
That means responsibilities, like conspiracy and confidentiality, but also privileges...
Guard!
-Call Wiesler for me.
-Colonel Wiesler has left the premises.
I see.
All right. Stand down.
What does a rider do when he's thrown?
He gets back on again.
Go inside. Sleep it off.
What happened has nothing to do with the house.
No, but with the whole country.
Christa!
Stop, I was at Kerschners' and they had no water. I need a shower.
You were in a hurry to get here.
-Operation "Lazlo" is still in progress.
-Are they both inside?
Yes.
Here's today's report.
The last report for Operation "Lazlo."
-Why didn't you call me?
-What?
Why didn't you call me?
I was out in the country.
Can you hand me the nail brush?
The Stasi was here. They searched the apartment.
Who was here?
State Securify!
Open up!
Stay here.
Hello, Comrade Dreyman.
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz from State Security.
I just wanted to make sure they did a thorough job last night.
Your study?
We'll start there.
Men, search carefully for notes hidden in the books.
Oh, what do we have here?
This door sill doesn't look kosher to me.
Could it be a secret compartment?
Let her go.
She's not a suspect.
The actress...
I was too weak.
I can never put right
-what I've done wrong.
-There's nothing to put right!
You understand?
Nothing. I moved the...
Forgive me, forgive me...
Forgive me, forgive me...
Take your men back to headquarters. This mission is over.
I've concluded the mission, Comrade Dreyman.
We must have received an erroneous tip-off. Sorry.
Come on.
There's one thing you should understand, Wiesler.
Your career is over.
Even if you were too smart to leave any traces.
You'll end up in some cellar, steam-opening letters until you retire.
That means the next 20 years. 20 years.
That's a long time.
MIKHAIL GORBACHEV ELECTED AS LEADER OF THE SOVIET UNION'S COMMUNIST PARTY
4 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS LATER
The Wall has come down.
Yes, the Wall has come down.
The border guards have opened the gates. The excitement is enormous!
People are streaming out in thousands!
It's unbelievable!
Dear listeners, November 9th, 1989, will go down in history!
A young family stands in front of me...
TWO YEARS LATER
What's wrong, my child?
Your Arthur is dead.
Arthur...
Can't you be wrong, just this once?
I saw him this morning!
No, sister.
Believe me. He fell to his death.
The loyal men surround him, as you do me, and despite the high sun, cast seven shadows on his noble dead body.
Crushed by the mighty wheel.
I see it, though I'd rather see any other horror.
Why am I not spared these visions?
Elena!
Go home and mourn.
I will finish your shift.
Too many memories, huh?
I couldn't stay in there either.
But what's this I hear?
You've not written since the Wall fell?
That's not good. After all our country invested in you.
Although I understand you, Dreyman.
What is there to write about in this new Germany?
Nothing to believe in, nothing to rebel against...
Life was good in our little Republic. Many people only realize that now.
-There is one thing I do need to ask you.
-Whatever you want.
Why was I never under surveillance?
Everyone else was.
Why not me?
You were under full surveillance.
We knew everything about you.
Full surveillance?
Every inch was bugged.
The full program.
Impossible.
Take a look behind your light switches.
We knew everything.
We knew that you couldn't give our little Christa what she needed.
To think that people like you once ruled a country...
RESEARCH SITE AND MEMORIAL
Visitors Welcome
It'll be a moment, there should be more than one file in your case.
I ordered them chronologically. Old ones at the top and the newer ones underneath.
My respects.
OPERATION "LAZLO"
Operation "Lazlo," subject:
Georg Dreyman, code name: "Lazlo," is launched.
The lead came from Minister Bruno Hempf.
"Lazlo" takes delivery of a daily Western newspaper without official permission.
I suggest not taking any action so as not to arouse suspicion of surveillance.
"Lazlo" and CMS unwrap presents, then presumably have intercourse.
The visitor was Paul Hauser's uncle from West Berlin.
They tell him about a play that Hauser and "Lazlo" will write for the GDR's 40th anniversary.
We expect further information on the play, a plot summary, etc.
Contents of first act:
Lenin is in constant danger.
Despite increasing external pressure, he sticks to his revolutionary plans.
Lenin is exhausted.
HGW...
HGW XX/7 ...
I, Christa-Maria Sieland, freely commit myself to work unofficially for State Security.
This decision is the result of my conviction that...
Georg Dreyman wrote the Spiegel article,
"One Who Made it to the Other Side."
His accomplices were the journalist Paul Hauser...
Christa-Maria Sieland was arrested on March 10th for drug abuse, on Minister Hempf's indication.
She was released at 1:50 p.m. on March 11th, having revealed "Lazlo's" hiding place and signing up as informant "Marta."
1:50 p.m...
So when did she...
After the unsuccessful house search of March 11, 1985 and "Marta's" fatal accident,
Operation "Lazlo" was terminated.
Note:
HGW's promotion ban takes effect immediately.
Transfer to Department M, with the recommendation not to entrust him with missions under his sole responsibility.
10:50a.m.:
Resume surveillance outside "Lazlo's" house.
At 3:10 p.m., "Marta" comes directly from Hohenschoenhausen to his apartment.
House search and report to follow.
End of Operation "Lazlo."
HGW, 3:15 p.m.
Who is HGW XX/7?
Stop.
Back to Hufeland Street.
TWO YEARS LATER
SONATA FOR A GOOD MAN
Hello.
GEORG DREYMAN SONATA FOR A GOOD MAN
A NOVEL
DEDICATED TO HGW XX/7, IN GRATITUDE.
29.80.
Shall I gift-wrap it?
No, it's for me.
It's hard to explain.
It's hard to explain myself.
But I never tell lies.
Everything I say is true, even when I don't say a thing.
Someone always has to die first before anything happens.
Otherwise life just goes on as if there's no problem.
No. Someone always has to die first.
And then everyone suddenly wakes up.
But it's too late then.
That's why someone had to die.
Every morning I play my game from 5:45 till 6:33.
Always.
I've now reached level 80.
If you don't know what that means, it's just... high.
It means you're strong, respected in the world.
Hundreds of thousands of people online. But for more than a year, I've only been playing with her.
REMEMBER, PRINCESS MAY BE A MAN IN REAL LIFE YOU ARE YOU
GLAD YOU ARE YOU TOO
In games you can be whoever and whatever you like.
Here you can only be one person... the jerk you see in the mirror.
I have to teach him everything.
For example, I have to teach him to laugh. People like that. To "give them a smile," as they say, which means smiling when really there's nothing to smile about.
That's how you create your own avatar.
20 seconds for my hands... and 15 for my hair.
You're as strong as your weapons and tools.
My heart rate meter, for example, to keep track of my heart, as they say, for when I get nervous.
Not that it makes me less nervous, but now I can see exactly how nervous I am.
My mother.
Now she's going to say,
- "Good morning, Ben."
- Good morning, Ben.
People say that whether it's a good morning or not.
"Good morning, Mom."
People never say, "Bad morning."
Did you sleep well, son?
"Really well, Mom.
It's nice of you to ask. Thank you."
Have you seen my troll, Ben?
My brother Jonas. He's still small.
I have to be his big brother and all.
Trolls don't have horses.
But somehow I never seem to know how to.
Calm down, Ben. Calm down.
Easy now, Ben.
Okay?
Don't take any of it to heart.
"I won't, Mom."
I won't, Mom. I won't take heart.
Won't take it to heart.
You are allowed to take heart, son.
Use your head, don't get worked up.
Give me a kiss.
Go on.
I've also got a weapon for fighting noise... other noise, but nicer.
Nicer noise.
I've got to use my head. Think ahead and think a-heart.
Be prepared, be forewarned. Forewarned is forearmed.
It's all a matter of planning, of strategy.
I can't say I was taken totally by surprise, but... it just proved that... that everything that'd happened up till now wasn't right.
Before you do something like that, things must be... it simply proved to me that things had just gone too far.
Way too far.
People are strange.
They talk and talk and talk.
And they drink each other's saliva.
All I can do is watch and copy them, imitate them.
Everything I'll never learn.
Because there was always something the matter... with me and with my hand.
Throw it to someone.
This is getting out of hand!
- Wrong.
- What's wrong with you?
I'm the man who's always wrong, but no one could tell me exactly how to be right.
Hi, you faggots!
Pat's got a new girlfriend.
Sit down, darling.
Not bad, eh? When an old girl's in heat, sparks can fly.
Do you know what your hand in her knickers feels like?
I don't want to know.
Have you ever given a horse a lump of sugar?
Bogaert and Desmet.
I'm their best friend.
At least, that's what they say.
Oh, there's Benny, our best friend.
Our alien from Pluto.
Living proof that man descended from mussels.
- Mussels?
- Hi, Benny-Boy.
The man from Mars!
Hi!
Whitney Houston for Benny-Boy. Over.
Come in, Benny-boy, over. Over, Benny-Boy.
Do you read me?
Hey, Benny-Boy.
Masturbation makes you deaf!
Is anyone home?
Deaf.
Why did they always come up with that?
If I sat there playing quietly, they thought my ears weren't working.
The doctor said I could hear perfectly well but I didn't listen.
He doesn't listen.
Then they thought there was something wrong with my eyes.
Can you see what those letters are?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Can you tell me what those are?
Yes.
The idea is that you tell me what the letters are.
C-O-H-Z-V, S-Z-N-D-C,
V-K-C-N-R, K-C-R-H-N,
V-O-R-K, R-H-S-O-N, K-S-V-R-H.
He always looked away as a baby. He never looked at me. He always looked through me.
Think of them as a computer that is configured differently.
They see everything. They see every leaf extremely clearly, but they don't see the tree.
They literally can't see the wood for the trees.
The big picture...
that's what it's all about.
You have to try to see the big picture and see that they don't see you.
- Look where you're walking.
- Retard.
Look where you're walking.
Retard.
Whitney Houston for Benny-Boy... we have a problem.
For Benny-Boy, the man from Mars.
There are a couple every year.
Always on their own in the playground.
It breaks my heart to see them, but what can you do? You can't nanny them.
You can't hold their hand.
Not now, that's for sure.
I wanted my son to go to an ordinary school.
My wife... my ex-wife... and I sometimes argued about it.
But he was much smarter than some of the other kids there. 10 times smarter.
An understandable question.
Where is God?
Where is He?
Where is this man with His long grey beard?
With all the wars, the poverty and the injustice... where is God?
People asked themselves the same question in Jesus's time.
Jesus was hanging there on the cross and they said, "Jesus, why don't you do something?
If your dad is boss of the universe, if you can raise someone from the dead, it's child's play for you.
Click clack and you're free."
Jesus, himself, wondered too.
What does the New Testament say?
At the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice,
"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
At that moment Jesus himself wonders that too.
He is so humiliated, dispirited, disheartened, that Jesus himself doubts God.
He lets go.
In fact, Jesus commits suicide.
Until he rises from the dead. Until the resurrection.
And so God...
God damn it, Bogaert!
Leave Ben alone!
It's not the first time I've had to tell you this!
You're going to be in trouble!
Ben's just different from you, from the below-average members of the class.
Fortunately for him, if you ask me!
But you obviously find it very difficult to accept that someone is different.
Or is there something you want to share with us?
Maybe your thoughts on the text you no doubt studied in detail last night?
- Yeah, okay.
- Right.
We're dying of curiosity.
Does anyone know what Jesus said when they took him down from the cross?
"Hey!
My feet first!"
That joke's grown really long whiskers.
My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?
I ask myself the same question numerous times a day.
Whoa whoa whoa!
Hey!
Calm down!
Take it easy.
Don't let them push you around, Ben.
Keep your cool.
Kids like him don't stand a chance. They're easy prey.
They once stuck a bandage over his mouth and told him the headmaster had said they had to.
He walked round all day with the bandage over his mouth.
He always brought a packed lunch with him, but he never managed to eat it.
But what are you supposed to do?
What we always do... too little.
Nothing.
Here's our favorite boy. Well, Benny-Boy?
Our Boy Jesus.
Leave him alone, guys.
Fuck off, Freddy faggot.
It can't be easy, being different, eh, Benny-Boy?
Whoa!
Better than average, eh?
In fact, we should look up to you.
You're the man!
Calm down.
Don't get worked up. Don't get worked up.
Just stay calm.
Smile.
They said to keep on smiling. Then it'll stop.
They'll stop.
Movie time!
Action.
Faggot!
Loser!
Faggot!
Loser!
Look at me, son.
If you don't tell me, how am I supposed to know, Vertriest?
Well, well!
Look who's here.
My favorite clients.
- The 10th visit is free.
- Do you know why you're here?
- I don't know.
- You really have no idea?
Is it a quiz?
Do you think it's funny, Desmet?
To be honest, I don't think it's the least bit funny.
Apparently you have been... how shall I put it?
- Bullying Vertriest.
We teased him, we didn't bully him.
We do it to each other too.
But a normal person realizes it's only in fun, sir.
We try to treat him normally, but normality doesn't come easy for him.
We're not the ones throwing chairs through windows, sir.
It's not easy for us either.
That'll do.
Save the act for the playground!
As for you... now's the time to open your mouth.
Go on. Go on, say something.
Tell me what those two clowns did.
But it's easy with hindsight.
Well, easier.
That's to say... you feel like an old campaigner after the war's been lost.
I can't remember how many times I went to all these schools. Always the same old story.
At this school we try to prepare the pupils for the harsh realities of life. Sometimes we succeed and sometimes we don't.
About the glass... The headmaster said they would let it be...
Thank you. ...if I let them have another look at me.
I hope we don't meet again soon.
So do I.
And you'll let us know what the doctor decides, whether he'll stay at this school?
Yes.
Come on, Ben.
Your camera, Ben.
Take a look at it.
Seriously, look at it!
Come on, Ben.
It can't go on like this, Ben. It just can't.
Well, son, are you okay?
Is something wrong?
Do you want to tell me something?
No.
You've got a message.
Oh, it's from that girl Scarlite.
When are we going to see her in real life?
Or doesn't that happen these days?
I'll leave you to chat, or whatever you call it.
Good night, sleep tight.
Why do they say "sleep tight"?
How do you sleep tight?
But she was waiting.
For me.
For me, Ben X. Ben X.
She was waiting... for me.
NOT WELL
I'M DEAD I'M DEAD TIRED
REVIVE YOU TWO-BIT HERO
It's nice weather. Let's go to the hospital again, eh, Ben?
Let's go and see the doctor.
Tell them everything again.
Dr. Meyvaert will be pleased to see us.
What is everything?
I wasn't normal.
- I was special.
- You're special.
They all said so.
Your son is hypersensitive.
He's just sensitive.
Emotionally dysfunctional. A light form of psychosis.
Just a bit stressed.
Like his mom?
Let me give you this.
We can always take a closer look.
"Take a closer look." Closer to what?
WAITING ROOM There's always a camera... that sees everything.
Who's mad and who isn't.
It's a waste of time. Just a waste of time.
You've got to face up to it, Bob.
It can't go on like this. We need help.
The kid has no business being here.
None.
None whatsoever.
I don't want to lose my mind!
You won't lose anything.
They said, "Just let yourself go."
But they wouldn't let me go.
A new line.
Suddenly they knew what it was.
I had a bad brain.
Asperger's Syndrome.
Asperger's Syndrome.
It's a form of autism.
That's what they discovered.
I've got autism.
Or autism has got me.
The man had spent 12 years studying, but hadn't learned to leave his nose alone.
It's not easy.
And it won't get any easier.
But you have to remember that Ben isn't feeble-minded.
On the contrary, he's very strong.
You could almost say strong-minded.
He talks and talks and talks, the man who understands me.
He has extraordinary perception.
In fact, he's an extraordinary boy who, every day, fights to be ordinary.
The question is, should we help him to dispel the illusion that he can live like a normal boy?
I've heard that his grades are good.
- Yes.
Yes. - Excellent even.
So why would we take him out of that school?
Because he's being bullied to death. That's why.
Right.
That happens.
It shouldn't, but it does.
At some point, they stick a label on you.
Autism.
Do you see?
To me, Ben was Ben.
They're volcanoes.
They're walking volcanoes. We don't know when they'll erupt.
Time bombs living undercover in our world. And the reaction often happens much later than the cause.
We'll just carry on like before.
We can do it.
We won't let them get to us.
Then my fingers told her everything.
But she said, "No endgame without me."
END = BEGINNING
The princess of letters on the other side of the land... who is always by my side when things get out of hand.
Who knows me without knowing my name.
Who could put me back together again.
Who could make me sleep tight.
She said, "Well, man, where's your plan?"
The one-word plan.
"Let me help you," she said...
"to rise above it all. To rise above yourself."
Calm down, Ben.
Calm down.
What's wrong with you today?
Got your phone?
Call me if necessary.
Don't take any of it to heart.
Give me a kiss.
And don't get worked up.
What exactly happened that day?
Who can say?
I only knew that he...
I knew how my son felt by the way he slammed the door in the morning.
It wasn't a bad door that morning.
At least that's what I thought.
HEY MARTIAN, HE WHO TALKS IS GETTING IT
Me, the Martian.
I'd be getting it.
Getting it. Getting it.
But getting what?
I was always getting it.
Always.
Did you see it?
Did you see what I filmed?
Yes.
Right...
I didn't know you were such a Holy Joe!
Are you okay, son?
You know you can tell me if something's wrong.
Is there a problem?
- No.
- Okay.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Did you think that was funny?
- Yes, I thought it was pretty funny.
- Am I laughing?
Maybe you haven't got a sense of humor, sir.
Don't start, Bogaert.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- You're playing with... - Fire!
Yes, you're playing with fire.
Can't you take a joke, sir?
You should defend yourself, son. Arm yourself against it.
Arm yourself.
Arm myself.
A death cross.
Its costs 350 gold in Archlord.
"If only we'd known," they say.
"If only we'd known."
What would they have done?
You see it coming every year.
You see it coming.
Every evening you pray to God that it'll turn out okay.
And usually it does.
But I guess... this time we forgot to pray.
You only know how things turn out. And we know that now.
I know one thing. The school will never be the same again.
Hi. Uh... Ben X.
I don't know you in real life, but I still know you really well.
I just want to say that what counts in-game counts in real life too.
You can't play an endgame without your healer, and that's me.
I'm worried about you.
Tomorrow I'll catch a train that gets to where you live at 10:22. I know you'll be there. You've never failed to keep an appointment, so... see you tomorrow.
- Hi, Martian!
- Hi, Benny-Boy.
Hey, pal, you're so tense.
Let's exchange ideas.
If you have any in that retarded head.
The bus.
My bus.
My always-there bus that drives off.
It's nice here amongst the trees.
Shall we sit on a bench next to each other?
Beardman told you not to get worked up.
And he's right.
Heart rate: 94.
What's that?
- That's some watch!
- You're spoiled.
Let me see!
Don't get aggressive!
Not like last time!
- Take it easy.
- You know what'll happen.
- We're friends.
- You know what'll happen.
Take it easy, Desmet. We're all friends here.
Jesus, you're really nuts.
- Relax.
- Call me if necessary.
- Yes, Mom.
- We're friends, aren't we?
- Hey, what's that? Hey!
- What's that?
A Nokia 3250. Christ!
What have you got that for?
You can't talk, so how can you use a phone?
- We should have it.
- It's to text his mommy.
To send text messages?
Let's see.
Here, look at this. An MMS from...
Who's that?
- Frankenstein's got a girlfriend!
- Scarlite.
She's called Scarlite.
Let's see.
Who's that?
Who is it?
He's got a girlfriend.
- Hey, she's not bad!
- Definitely isn't!
I just want to say that what counts in-game counts in real life too.
You can't play an endgame without your healer.
Your healer?
Is she your healer?
Dealer more likely!
Incredible!
Tomorrow I'll catch a train that gets to where you live at 10:22.
Tomorrow at 10:22, at the station, on the platform.
We'll be there too, eh, Desmet?
We've got to see this!
We can't miss out on our best friend's first date!
True or not true?
Telephone. Telephone, Benny.
- She's phoning him!
- It's Mommy!
Hello, Mommy.
I'm in the park with my friends.
Leave a message after the beep. Bye.
Bye, Mommy. Oops, mailbox.
Let me know where you are, okay?
Don't you mind being stalked, Benny-boy?
Always having to listen to bullshit from your mother?
I'll keep your phone, eh, Benny-Boy?
What do you think?
- Easy!
Easy with the crucifix!
- You are mad after all!
Hey, Benny, telephone.
It's Mommy. Aren't you going to answer it?
It's Mommy. She'll come and get you.
Come on, Ben. Answer your phone.
My buddy Benny-Boy.
You crazy Martian!
We're not taking you with us again!
And to think we had a present for you as well.
Look, this is only for our best friends.
It's a little pill that has a big effect.
It's called a Superman. Superman.
Open your mouth.
There's a smiley on it, for people like you who never laugh. Want it?
Some water to wash it down.
You'll feel just like Superman!
There!
Now swallow.
The first one's free because you're our friend.
It'll do you good. You won't be so aggressive any more.
Here.
So you know what time it is when you go whining to the fatmaster.
I don't believe this!
Jesus Christ!
I don't believe it!
Phone me, please.
What's that, Mom?
Nothing, son.
It's nothing.
Let's go and look for Ben.
Damn it.
God damn it!
Damn!
Damn me!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Feel.
Feel me, Ben.
You have to learn to feel if you want to learn to feel good.
What's up, son?
What happened?
Are you okay?
Just look at you!
Is everything okay?
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you, Ben?
That'll do, son.
It's nothing, Mom.
That's what people always say, it's nothing.
I'm healed, Mom.
I'm really healed.
Completely healed.
Your big brother is Superman!
Calm down, Ben, please!
That's enough!
There's water coming out of your eyes, Mom.
Water is coming out of your eyes but I know what it is.
Salt and moisture!
People say I don't understand because I don't understand feelings, but I do.
I know what they are.
Do you remember when I was little I tried to push those tears back into your eyes?
It was just because I didn't want you to be sad.
People always say it's all right and they ask,
"Is everything all right?"
And then you reply, "Yes, yes!
"Yes, everything's all right.
Everything is right.
Everything's going right."
Everything's all right.
Everything's going right.
- I'm not crazy.
- No!
- Just a bit difficult.
- Calm down, Ben.
Yes, I'm a different cult.
But I'm training myself.
I'm training, training, training.
I'm in bits. But I've been reborn, like in video games.
- You always get a new life.
- Come on, son.
Let's go home.
Come on, son. That's it.
And then it was over. I was over.
Eyes open again, head shut once more.
Ben.
What's that, Ben?
Why didn't you tell me?
- Ben... - Then it was time for truthfulness. Shamefulness, painfulness.
Who did that?
Tell me, Ben.
Everything can be destroyed so easily.
Everything can be destroyed so easily.
Why couldn't I just be destroyed too?
Stop it, Ben. Stop it!
Jonas!
Then I saw that jerk standing there again. And I attacked him.
I'd heard it before, the calling of night falling. Going right to the end of pain.
How beautiful!
Blood flowing from a vein.
A bit later my father came round.
My dad, who also never knows what to say.
So I usually understand him that way.
She'd come too.
Sabine, his girlfriend, as he'd always say.
Who always asked how I was holding up.
How are you holding up?
- It can't go on like this.
- No, Sabine.
It can't go on like this.
But still, it will have to. It will have to.
It's not the first time and it won't be the last.
Come on, Sabine. Leave it.
It's okay, leave it.
Look after him.
Heart rate: 55.
Under 13 and you're dead.
42 to go.
Then you've done it. You're finished.
42 heartbeats less and you arrive.
You can't play an endgame without your healer and that's me.
Tomorrow I'll catch a train that gets to where you live at 10:22.
- And I know you'll be there...
- 9:36.
Got to go to the station.
I've got to go to the station.
Calm down. Calm down, Ben.
GONE OUT DON'T WORRY
I'll keep your phone.
The station. The station.
10:22, at the station on the platform.
We'll be there. We've got to see.
I can't be late.
She shouldn't have to wait. She who doesn't know what I look like, who I am.
That I'm not there. But them...
I knew I'd find her.
I'd smell her, like the dog I am.
There she was.
She'd come.
She'd really come.
For real!
She was waiting for me.
She was sending a text message.
Probably to me.
To me about whom she can only fantasize, whom she doesn't recognize.
To me who is here with a phone that's disappeared.
Then everything happened so quickly, as they say.
But everything always happens too quickly for me.
She left.
Because she couldn't see the invisible me.
But what my head couldn't do, my legs were able to.
There's the train. A spaceship that has come to collect us from a barren planet.
Courage is everything. Doing what you thought you couldn't do.
Her scent was enough.
The scent of a season that had yet to be invented on a continent still to be discovered, but that I could smell miles from the coast.
With her perfect neck turned towards me, she was dreaming up a landscape.
I imagined how I'd place my lips there, staking my claim.
My claim to liberation.
Just sitting here in the warmth from her body, briefly, everything was perfect.
This is a passenger announcement:
We are about to arrive in Brussels.
Are you okay?
I had to say something. Anything.
But the only thing I say is nothing.
All I can do is leave.
And she left.
She just left.
And I just had to leave too.
I was scared stiff. A mother feels these things.
A hundred times a second I thought,
"Don't let him do anything stupid.
Please don't let him do anything stupid."
I remember he once asked me,
"How many reasons does someone need to commit suicide?"
I asked him what he meant by how many.
He said, "How many?
Two, five, 10?"
That's what he was thinking about.
He wanted to know if he had enough.
The endgame. My plan.
The one-word plan.
Murder.
The murder of myself.
Catch the train. To nowhere.
There is one advantage to killing yourself.
You never have to look far for your victim.
You don't even do it yourself, the train does it for you.
What was his motive?
A locomotive.
If you think it's all over quickly, you're wrong.
Even if you're lucky enough to be decapitated immediately, apparently your head remains conscious for another 13 to 15 seconds.
So you can imagine that what goes through your mind isn't pleasant. Seeing bits of your body flying in all directions.
They say that just before you die... your life flashes before your eyes like a film. So?
Did you see anything?
- But who...
- Who pushed you?
Me, of course. Who else, blockhead?
You?
Does he have any distinguishing scars or birthmarks?
Scars?
It was already broken, wasn't it?
Did you notice anything out of the ordinary?
I don't get it, Ben.
Honestly.
Are you the man who escaped from the dungeon of Silancium?
Who crossed Windrill Desert alone with me?
Who fought Bailor?
Who crossed the swamps of Ondekon with me?
Who conquered Zerdin?
You're level 80, for God's sake.
And that's your endgame?
You just throw yourself under a train?
Was that your plan?
Just click on exit and log out.
"Gone out. Don't worry."
That's good news, isn't it?
It means he's gone out for a bit and you don't have to worry.
My son doesn't just go out for a bit on a Saturday morning. He's not able to.
Besides, look. I found this.
I don't know if you know, Ben, but... in real life dying is fairly definite.
You can't change your mind.
You can die as much as you like.
But not for real.
That's not the way we play, Ben.
You're level 80.
Do you want to quit this world, Ben?
Go on then, go.
But if you want revenge, take revenge.
Otherwise you're exactly what they say you are, a loser.
Play to win, Ben.
Everything's a matter of planning, of strategy.
Don't you just love Fanta?
I'm really happy... that you're you.
We'll file a missing person's report and circulate his description nationally.
What about this?
What are you going to do about this?
I'll inform our social services unit.
They're familiar with things like that, unfortunately.
"I just wanted to go away," he said.
"But I didn't dare die because I didn't know what that was."
Was that your big plan?
How are we going to do it?
Take poison?
No.
Imagine if you took poison and then changed your mind.
You'd have to call the Poison Center.
"Hello?"
The people at the Poison Center get lots of phone calls like that.
That's for idiots.
Or you could hang yourself.
That's cool.
Apparently you die with a huge erection.
But then you shit yourself.
That's not cool being found like that, eh?
Do you know what else they always find under the fingernails of someone who's hung themselves?
Little bits of rope and skin.
Do you know why?
Because they always desperately try to get the rope off their neck. The chair's too far away and they can't reach it.
You think it's exciting, huh, Ben?
Dying.
Then everything is solved in one fell swoop.
Ben is solved in one fell swoop.
Aren't you going to take one last look to see if there's another solution?
Take one last look around.
You need to be more creative, damn you!
Shut up, beautiful.
You are so beautiful.
"Assemble a guild," she said.
"Like in Archlord."
It was her idea.
Some quests are too big for two.
"You have to help me," he said.
So we helped him.
We knew everyone would say that you can't do that.
But that's more or less why I did it.
Smoking's forbidden here, Sabrina.
My name's Sabine.
You should be grateful for not being able to smoke.
Yeah, I'm really grateful.
You'll live half a day longer.
You're not serious, right?
You're not really going to do this!
You know you can't!
I can't do it!
Sabine, you don't have to do anything.
You insisted on coming.
I don't care whether you come or not but if you think it's easy for us, you're wrong.
Look.
The sea.
The end of the world.
You know what they say, Ben?
Every end is a beginning.
Anyone want anything to eat? Ben?
- Sabine?
- No, thanks.
Don't you feel very well, Sabine?
Not really, no.
Is this how you want it to be, Ben?
Right.
Ben, uh...
I'II...
I have to put my back into it.
Everything is a matter of thinking ahead. And thinking a-heart.
Everything is a matter of willpower.
Courage is everything.
Ultimately doing the thing that you can't do.
If you die in a game then you're just out of the game for a while and you have to go and look for your body.
All they found of me was a tape. And I had gone.
These are particularly disturbing images that once again remind us that one Flemish youngster takes his or her life every week.
In a recent study, 10% of Flemish youngsters between 15 and 18 say that they have attempted suicide at some point. A very worrying figure.
And now the sports.
Everyone here today, members of the family, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys... we've all come together today to say goodbye to a very special young man who was taken from us so suddenly
Ben's life was never easy.
His condition made things very difficult for him.
Maybe we only realize now, when it's too late, that he battled against his handicap, if you can call it that, that was much worse than we could've imagined. We never really had any real contact with him and won't be able to now.
Today all we can do is accept that some things are just too heavy to bear.
That is why...
Hello.
Thank you for coming.
I too have come to an end, as they say. Come to an end.
I died of myself.
Fellow men and un-fellow men... my fight is over.
At the end of your life, they say a film of your life flashes before your eyes.
Here are a few scenes that may interest you.
Go on, Ben.
Now, the endgame.
She called it dying creatively.
Suicide without the dying.
Dying without quitting.
Or quitting without dying.
I had to learn everything.
But I'd forgotten the most important thing.
Learning to lie. To deceive.
Someone had to die first.
Otherwise you wouldn't have come.
Not for a boy.
You can't keep on begging and asking...
You're so angry, Mommy. And asking again and again that something be done to put a stop to it.
That they'd finally stop tormenting my son and making his life... sorry, but it's true... making his life so impossible.
His autism is his problem, but it's not a problem to him.
The others are the problem. The others.
They have to learn to leave my kid alone.
Ben just wanted to quit. Now he has.
Fortunately, he's still alive.
He's alive.
In his own world, maybe, but he's alive.
He's alive!
He's living his life.
She said,
"It's high time to become who you are."
Just let it happen, Ben.
Don't be scared.
If you want to learn to feel good, you have to learn to feel.
Stroke him.
I've never been what they call happy. But I've never been this kind of happy.
Beautiful, no?
You don't have to talk to animals.
Do you dare sit on it, you two-bit hero?
As soon as people see a horse, they want to sit on it. But has anyone ever heard a horse ask for that? Do you?
If a horse could choose...
Yes, well...
Border security is the sovereign right of every country and therefore also of our German Democratic Republic.
A regime of injustice has committed another injustice. A greater injustice than anything committed before.
Daarom ben ik als vrij man trots op de woorden: Ich bin ein Berliner.
THE MIRACLE OF BERLIN
20.
Juni 1988, OST-Berlin 17 Monate Vor Dem Fall Der Mauer Marco!
You're ruining your future out of plain stubbornness!
I could shovel coal in a kindergarten.
I'd be off work in summer and we'd go out dancing.
Stop this now. I'm serious! You're dead serious, I know.
Buddies and beer!
I wanted a change. I'll pump Grandpa.
He'll give Dad heaps and you'll be stressed all night.
- I'll take it, Kutte.
- As you wish, Comrade Colonel.
- Wait a minute! - I'm in a hurry.
- You're not going out like that!
- I'm 18 now. - That's an order! - You can't order me any more.
Your upbringing!
And in front of the driver!
Tell him it's not on!
I'm never telling him that again.
I didn't understand a word.
"Don't wait for the night to bring you morning."
"Don't wait for the Song of Unity to bring you freedom."
"Don't wait for tomorrow to live today." "Don't wait..." and so on.
That's good. You think so?
Don't tell me you wrote it.
Shut up! No gabbing!
On the double!
Legs apart!
Your number is 24/73.
Take it out!
Wipe under your arm and the sac.
Now put it back.
It's for the dogs.
Look straight ahead!
Open your eyes. You've shirked military service, to which you had committed.
Probably just to get your diploma.
Fraudulently, at the workers' expense.
- Why am I here? - Don't ask stupid questions.
You were arrested at a riotous assembly of enemy elements you initiated.
- Do you want me to believe...
- That is your son, sir?
Yes, that is my son. How do you live?
You have no apprenticeship.
I'll tell you something.
Dropouts do time in our prisons.
Especially hostile elements like you.
We'll make short work of this.
I wouldn't allow such a thing. Comrade Colonel... may I? We haven't yet been introduced, Captain.
Lieutenant Marion Niemann, First Directorate.
Let me glance over the list of goods you requisitioned from us.
- Comrade Kaiser happens to have it. - Yes.
It could be processed more quickly if the Comrade Colonel didn't have to deal with this matter.
Have you gone totally crazy? You've had it too good!
Sure. No hunger, no homelessness, full employment... What is wrong with that?
What? What do you want?
You haven't built anything!
- At your age I didn't have a motorbike. - At my age, you built the Wall!
- I'd do it again! - You would too.
- You think fun is dangerous!
- You'll see what fun it is in Bautzen.
I've seen people being broken.
But suit yourself. You can stew in your own juice.
We'll get some peace at home.
It's your decision.
If you're so tough, my son, why not do three years in the army and after that, university.
Are you such a complete idiot?
- I won't go to the border. - Pardon?
At least Anja.
She's not part of it. It was her first time, I invited her.
It's gone that far, has it?
You are dangerous. Yes or no? Or shall we just forget it?
Shake hands on it.
Shake hands!
- I hate you.
My son was with a girl called Anja.
Could you organise her release and see if she has a record?
- Jürgen?
- Don't make such a fuss.
Smell this.
- I don't smell anything.
- That's just it.
Hi, Mum.
- Will you be seeing the professor?
- He comes in almost every day.
I'm joining the army in autumn.
I changed my mind. I want to go on studying.
German literature.
Give him time and he'll make the right decision.
I'm so proud of you.
This calls for celebrations!
Thanks for telling me first.
- I have to go. Bye.
What did you do to yourself?
So you'll do your three years.
I'm going to crash.
No, I'm sorry. Only five copies have arrived.
What must I do to get to the top of your list?
Not even a Sputnik.
There used to be so many.
- Maybe next time. - A likely story!
- Professor. - Hello.
- My son has decided on literature. - I'm delighted.
- Leipzig or Humboldt?
- 8.50 marks. Thank you.
1.50 change.
- Bye! - Have a good trip!
I know a great place to wash. Half an hour from here.
"You fools who search my trunks Will in them nothing find.
- Where did you learn to swim like that? - In the KJS swimming team.
That was it for excitement.
I live with a stuffy family.
At least you have parents.
- They're a pain, petit bourgeois.
- Are you crazy? Someone looked after your bleeding knee and blew on it.
Yes, all the time, like a mother hen.
You grew up in luxury, you got a motorbike, and you complain?
You have no idea.
This always happens to me.
- Shit!
- What's got into you?
You're another one of those "no future" types. - Wait! - No responsibility!
Don't make such a fuss. Anja...
"I thank Lenin and the October Revolution "for what we've become." That's as old as the hills.
- I meant that I met you.
You're the only one who quotes Heine just like that.
- And what are you doing with it? - Studying. Three years of dust, then uni.
German literature.
All organised.
I'll want to keep seeing you.
We'll let it last, as long as it lasts.
Okay.
Comrade Niemann from HV1. Yes. Have her come in.
- I've got something for you.
- So do I, but you won't like it.
This Anja has a file.
That was to be expected.
- Is she high-profile?
- I didn't see the file. I only spoke with the files chief.
I can't say by whom, but the file is regularly cleared. He doesn't know who's protecting her.
Why would she be after my son?
- I don't know.
- Find out! I'm no longer your subordinate.
Forgive me, Marion. I'm sorry. I'm...
Why would anyone doctor a high-profile internal file?
You'd need a codename, registry contacts...
- What's going on here?
- I'll keep at it. Marion... Thank you.
Rather, more departures to the West often make those left behind want to follow.
That's more than you managed.
Breakfast!
Gold for 200m backstroke
Try the Hungarian salami.
- We get it out when we have visitors.
- Grandpa!
- Sorry. - Thank you.
Could you pass the orange juice?
You're an orphan?
Yes.
Were you adopted? - I think no one wanted me.
- I can't imagine that, in your case!
- Well?
Did you sleep well? - Not that again, Grandpa. What a party!
- What is it you learn there? - Nursing. - Oh?
- I'm a nurse too.
- Mum! Let's go.
- I practised up to a year ago.
- Excuse me...
- Thank you for the nice breakfast.
- Come visit us. Gladly.
She's good for him.
I can feel it.
Joe and Klara are now banned from Berlin.
- The others have to report. - Funny... The one who organised the rave is free.
- It's not my fault.
- Krumme's just miffed. Your bird shows up, and there's a raid.
Marco!
Stop it, Marco!
Marco!
Are you crazy? He's somebody in the ministry.
Marco!
During his trip to Siberia, Gorbachev commented
"Everyone must participate."
He called for change from the bottom up.
The beginning of the end.
Look what's happening in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
Not to mention Poland.
It's your birthday. Stop watching for once.
- Anything ready yet?
- Have a sausage. - She doesn't like them. - Your favourite salad.
- Everyone my age is dead.
I'm just too lazy to drop.
I grew up in Neudorf, near Brandenburg. I went to school there, got married there...
And if not for World War II, you'd never have left.
That way, at least you went to Stalingrad. And Siberia.
Jürgen was so embarrassed, he'd rather have had his teacher as a dad than me.
He was a staunch Communist and before little Jürgen knew it, he was in the Party and the Guards.
Did you organise my release? Are you with the Stasi?
My son doesn't interrogate or spy on anyone.
He just procures the pencils. He didn't make it to the front.
As long as I provide you with beer, you should be happy!
Let's leave it at that.
I have work to do.
My mother is happy if they're not at each other's throats.
Any family is better than none.
Listen, Marco. When you leave the army
I can earn the money then and you can study.
And then we can have a family.
So here we go!
You'd be better off with me.
I don't read the revanchist books my father-in-law gets.
A divorce in my position...
Out of the question. Forget it.
"He went back to the fox."
The Little Prince
"'Goodbye,' he said.
'Goodbye,' said the fox.
"'Here is my secret.
Shoe polish, shaving things, twice.
Two bars of soap...
- Why everything twice?
- One set into the combat pack.
One set for the locker. Here.
- I don't smoke, Grandpa.
- It's the only currency that counts.
Sock and trouser braces are important, and stamps and band-aids.
- And don't take a cheap padlock.
Well... the time has come. Come here.
- Well? - Hi. - Where's Anja?
- No idea.
Don't go bollocking, you hear?
Don't let the others, either.
Promise.
Surprise!
Where did you come from? Stop that!
Off it goes.
Not that much!
Fall in! Two rows.
On the double! Move those legs!
Forget that civvy sauntering!
Hands by your side!
Eyes straight ahead! Wipe that smirk off your face!
- What's your name?
- Marco Kaiser. It's Soldier Kaiser!
Even before we're sworn in? I'll remember you, buddy.
New recruits ready for muster, Lieutenant.
Comrades!
You are now part of the National People's Army of our socialist fatherland, the German Democratic Republic.
We are here to guard the peace so your wives and parents can sleep without worry.
- Shoe size?
- 43. - Hat size?
- 56.
Step aside.
- Clothes size? - 48. - Shoe size?
- Head size? - 60. Step aside.
Soldier Kaiser.
- Clothes size?
Step aside.
2¹/² minutes! It has to be faster!
Look at you, Soldier Klee!
Does this meet regulations?
It's only been a week and I miss Marco so much.
You can move into his room and help me clean up.
Could I?
I wouldn't need to sleep in the hostel any more.
Not now!
You've never seen what I'm about to show you.
- Where did you get that?
One good turn deserves another. I need a little gift.
Her mother was riding a bicycle when she was hit by a truck.
The driver was never found. Anja was five.
She was put in an orphanage. Then why does she say both her parents died?
The certificate says "Father Unknown", but there must be some note.
"'A link to Operation Tango cannot be excluded."
The code name for military advisers to the Chilean government.
- Are you crazy? - Look at this. 13 September 1973.
Two days after the fascist military putsch in Chile.
Hanna had her move in with us.
She's probably sniffing me out.
I have to take the file back.
- I found this too.
It will suit you.
Move, comrades!
Time is passing.
Get a move on!
Move! Next! Move!
Grothe...
Becker...
This is for another unit.
Right face!
- Some clean bedlinen for you.
- Thank you.
Marco was 12 and about to join the Sports Academy.
Jürgen thinks I ruined Marco's career.
Why? Four years of boarding school.
He became totally estranged.
He only spoke of his trainer and pals. He stopped being a child.
Suddenly he developed a high fever.
I took him to hospital. If I hadn't been a nurse myself...
I'd never have seen his blood count.
His circulation was near collapse.
I didn't let him go back.
I threatened Jürgen... that I'd publish the results if he made any difficulties.
Since then, neither of them has talked to me.
It was hell for all of us.
I was protecting him.
He thought I was taking his pals away.
Mail from the front!
Letter from Marco! We're in the kitchen!
I've never told anyone.
"My dears, I'm well.
"We get confirmed on 12 December.
It would be nice if you came. Marco."
That's all?
He's well. He says so. Those are the letters you write when a pal is freezing to death beside you.
Move, move, move!
Get going!
Comrade Major, recruits exercising!
Squad halt!
Get off your arse and keep standing!
If you keep vomiting we'll lose so many points...
- Hey! - Now get up!
- Hey.
Lay off! - Don't get in my way!
Platoon, attention! Soldier Freese!
Take command!
Yes, sir, Comrade Corporal! Platoon!
Get up!
Help!
Help!
Typical!
You arsehole! Becker!
Find two pieces of wood!
- You'll get splints and move on.
- He can't! Shut up, Klee!
Pull yourself together, you hear?
- Get the medics! Fire a flare!
- Salute first, Comrade Soldier!
Fire a flare! They're for emergencies.
Prison Cell 2. Occupant, Soldier Marco Kaiser.
What is worrying is your stupidity, Comrade Kaiser.
Assault on a superior.
You really beat into that lapdog and broke his jaw... and your knuckles.
You wanted to help a comrade.
That qualifies you as wanting more, being responsible, being special.
Carry on.
I am able to declare today that in the book of German-Soviet history not only has a new page been turned, but a new chapter has begun, with, we hope, many new pages.
NATO stability has facilitated the dismantling of the SS-20 missiles.
Only the East German authorities are ignoring the signs of the times.
I swear...
I swear... faithfully to serve the German Democratic Republic, my fatherland... and to protect the Workers' and Peasants' State against every enemy.
I swear it.
Congratulations, my boy.
- Our table?
- I said you have to wait.
- Did you book a table?
- Yes, yes. - You booked?
- I hope it's not gone.
Excuse me, this table has been reserved.
There's been a mistake.
- But... - I'm sorry.
Please leave. - I'm with my son.
This is appalling!
I'll go without.
- Wait! It's just been fixed.
- Marco!
- Do you know your unit?
- I can't tell you.
- Will you have to go to the border?
- They're military secrets.
Here we go!
You don't understand. They're not as dumb as I thought.
How's your apprenticeship?
It's coming along.
Your mother is absolutely fantastic.
And your grandpa is so much fun.
I have something for you.
Do you want it?
You had something for me.
Yes...
I almost forgot. You'll like it. For you.
- Who took these? - Who do you think?
- You undressed in front of Grandpa?
- Don't read anything into it.
- He reads Western porno magazines.
There are nudes in our paper too now and then.
Come on, Marco.
- I thought you'd like them.
- Sure.
It was harmless.
The Suez Crisis.
Vietnam.
The Falkland Islands. Chile.
If President Allende could have counted on his army
Latin America would be socialist today.
We witness how the Junta raged and oppressed its people and how capitalist companies exploited a land rich in resources.
An American oil company manager once confessed to me that for oil, the US would come into any war in the world.
That is the national doctrine of the United States.
West Germany has the world's biggest stockpile of nuclear weapons.
We are in the front line of socialism. NATO's strongest units are west of that line.
Almost 900,000 troops are stationed in West Germany, a ratio 26 times greater than that in the USA itself.
In Great Britain's worst air disaster probably all 259 passengers of a Boeing 747 and some 15 inhabitants of the town of Lockerbie lost their lives.
It always happens before Christmas.
Not being allowed to travel isn't so bad sometimes.
The British government ordered an investigation...
I meant it as a joke.
Come on, Grandpa, why doesn't he get leave?
Sometimes that's how it is in the army, my girl. You just don't know.
A year ago, this day's glad message would not have reached a soul on this spot in Berlin.
Attention!
At ease!
Turn it down a bit, Krüger.
Comrades, some of you may wish to go home to your families, and your girlfriends.
I understand. But did you know that Nixon ordered the bombing of Hanoi at Christmas?
I won't ask my subordinates to do anything I won't do.
I offer you a choice.
Two bottles of beer... or 5000 metres in the morning and a day's leave for whoever can beat me.
Dear viewers, with us is the six-times gold medallist of the last Olympic Games.
We'll shortly show you those feats in a flashback.
Kristen Otto!
She's in Lane 5.
She's racing ahead.
Lap time, 26.36.
Faster than her own world record!
She's leading!
She's in front!
Can she make it?
Can she hold on?
Can she crown an extraordinary career? It looks like it!
My Marco could have stood there. Just goes to show, ours is the superior system. Yes...
Not bad! Maybe next year.
Mr Kaiser?
Merry Christmas, Jürgen.
You too, Martin. Season's greetings. Oh... thanks, Jürgen.
Thank you.
I wanted to ask...
We're running out of microphones.
We can't even ensure surveillance of the Sinus Bar in the Palast Hotel.
- Any concerns? - January.
Economic mission. Prime Minister from the West.
Our objective is two million... or we'll be bankrupt by summer. I'll see what I can do.
There's something else.
Here... her.
We're working on him and her.
- Well then... thanks again. - Merry Christmas.
Right... there's more.
"Change What Needs Changing.
"The Socialist Unity Party of Germany is still frantically resisting
"Mikhail Gorbachev's transformation bug..."
"Getting a foothold in the GDR." That's right.
Those old crocks up there...
Not in this house, or you move out.
And I want you out in five minutes!
- If you throw Anja out, I'll move out too. - Where to?
She's part of our family.
Only her mother died. You have no idea. She's got it in for Marco and us too.
All this Western stuff has to go, once and for all.
Dinner is ready!
We should talk about it.
We shall not talk about it.
Just keep out of my family affairs or find somewhere else to stay, got that?
Let's eat now. Then we'll open presents.
Will you open the wine, Father?
Breast or drumstick?
Drumstick.
- Cabbage? - No. - Gravy?
- Yes. - See you tomorrow. - All right.
Jürgen wasn't always like that. When we met, in '66 during the harvest, we embraced the new spirit and anti-fascism.
Justice for all!
We did achieve something. That binds people.
I always have the feeling I have to pay for something I didn't do.
I'm not lying.
When Marco gets out, I'll get you your own flat.
Finish your apprenticeship now.
You can always come to visit me when Jürgen isn't here.
The two of us just won't let anything get us down.
You hear?
Ward 2, Voting Booth 19 in Berlin-Pankow.
It's early morning.
General Secretary of the SED and Chairman of the GDR State Council Erich Honecker...
"Spring at last!
We fold slips of paper today. "My first election.
"How do you vote?
Fold on command and drop it in the urn? "I only know the cemetery urns.
"I can't write what I really yearn for, my prince..."
My dear congregation and friends.
I've just heard of severe clashes in Leipzig between the security services and demonstrators... who obviously wanted to protest against vote-counting manipulations.
Walk along here, citizens, and have your IDs handy.
- Hanna! - Anja!
- I'll take charge of this woman. - Yes, ma'am! Get out of here!
The election for the National Front of the German Democratic Republic produced 12, 182,050 valid votes.
In the name of the Electoral Commission of the Republic
I thank everyone who took part in these local elections.
- They've arrested dozens.
- What do you want from me?
You have an Ormig machine.
Thank goodness you're safe. - What about you? Where's Walter?
- At home.
Things can't go on like this.
In Poland, Hungary... even with Big Brother. And now here.
The wave of East German refugees entering West Germany via Hungary and Austria is greater than was thought.
Stop! Who's there?
Weapons on the ground!
Come out!
Against the wall! Against the wall. On the double!
Legs apart! Password!
Snowball.
Exemplary alertness, Comrade Kaiser.
Action completed!
Two columns, route step, march!
Kaiser, wait.
Got a girlfriend?
Then it's time to take leave.
- May I ask a question, Comrade Major? - Go ahead. Were you really in Latin America once?
Long ago. In another life.
Since returning, I've probed men to see what they're made of. I'd like to make you platoon leader.
I expect loyalty.
You look wonderful, my son. You've lost weight.
Grandpa!
My boy!
If you're caught... - I did, Grandpa.
I'm going to change.
- Marco!
- Come on.
- I have a surprise for you.
Stop.
You don't think I'd let you see your mates first.
I don't believe this! Marco! Hey, man!
Two got out via Hungary.
Pepe and Knopf have gone too now.
- It's shit, man.
- Stay in the country and resist.
Did you get border duty?
Will you tell us where? Why?
Would you shoot us?
Do you want to get out so badly you'd risk your life?
Has the army turned you around?
- I'll kick your arse! You've become the arsehole of the system.
- Let's go. Who needs this shit?
- Piss off, little Stasi boy.
You always were.
Anyone else?
You don't belong here any more. - What's got into you?
- Me?
What about you?
Defend you is okay, but defend myself and I'm an arsehole?
- You don't see what's going on.
- What don't I see?
Everything's changing, people are fleeing...
I don't give a stuff, they're no good to us anyway. Traitor!
The Chinese People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square last night because counter-revolutionary elements...
In a bloodbath without precedent the Chinese leadership tried to re-establish order last weekend...
What's the matter?
Anja. Anja, my girl.
Come on out.
- What's going on there? - They're defending socialism.
...to stop the military from intervening, but some misjudged the situation.
"Soldier Marco Kaiser to report at Post 803 for mobilisation."
Their allegedly patriotic actions were thus punished.
I have to report to my unit. You could say you weren't here.
Good night.
The army fears the students will storm the universities, those pro-democracy centres.
Foreign students...
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Take care, my boy. Keep your chin up. - Bye.
- I won't let you go.
Let the boy go, Hanna. An order is an order.
Can't you see what's happening?
What if they order you to shoot during a demonstration when we're leaving church?
You can't be serious.
You run to church and get stirred up?
Marco!
Are you crazy?
That girl is the best thing ever in your life.
- And you treat her like dirt!
- You have no idea, Mum. Your life is in your books.
I won't let you take my friends from me any more.
Heads down! Faster! Keep moving.
We're at the highest state of readiness.
No one's to leave the base.
Allocate duties to returnees. Be ready to move out.
And 100% vehicle readiness. Dismissed. Execute.
Move!
Give it here.
You can do better!
"Dear Marco, I can't believe it's over, even if there was a misunderstanding.
"But I have to write to you. "I wanted to ask your father if it's true he has people interrogated.
"I went to your house.
Grandpa! Grandpa!
"I found your grandpa.
"He'd had a heart attack.
The ambulance took 45 minutes.
"Did you know 5000 doctors have applied to leave?
Anja!
Foreign Minister Genscher at the embassy in Prague.
Over 5000 GDR refugees have sought asylum here. He announced:
What are you doing here?
And with my letters?
Not here.
Corporal Kaiser!
Anja's 5th birthday
Your father is alive.
He was on a foreign mission when your mother died.
You're Stasi.
You manipulate and betray. I don't believe you!
I know.
Nothing is worse than betrayal of trust.
Your father is a Stasi officer. He was an adviser in Chile. He disappeared two days after the putsch.
Just when a truck hit your mother on a country road.
I was captured by the junta.
Here they thought I caused my wife's...
- What is this shit? - I wasn't allowed to see Anja! You were put in an orphanage and kept under surveillance.
It took a year to convince the comrades I hadn't been turned!
I proved myself little by little but they refused me access to my own daughter.
She was pretty wild.
- He's always cut me out? - They wanted something on him.
Can you see anyone still willing to give his life for socialism, the only fair way of life?
The alternative?
Exploitation, repression. Less wealth at the expense of each. I saw the corpses in the streets.
5000 political prisoners in a stadium.
This file was constantly tampered with.
Marco's father thinks you were planted to inform on him.
- I won't play. - Then you'll never find out.
Why are you doing all this?
Have a look around. I'm not blind.
Right.
We'll assemble on Friedrichsstrasse.
You'll get flags and torches there.
Stay together. Don't be provocative.
In a torch-lit procession, the Free German Youth celebrated 40 years of their socialist homeland.
Are these the signatures of your wife and daughter-in-law?
She's not my daughter-in-law and won't be either.
Sorry, but I have to report it.
- What lists are these?
"The flags fly high,
"The ranks closed tight..." - Anja?
Grandpa? - "The storm-troopers march..."
Hi, Grandpa. Where's Anja?
In 1933, we marched through that Gate. - "Comrades..." - Grandpa!
"Shot by Reds and reactionaries..."
Grandpa, where's Anja? She left something there for you.
- Thanks, Grandpa.
All in order, Comrade?
- How do I get to the hostel?
Let me go!
No brutal force!
No brutal force!
FREEDOM You Stasi pig!
The next elections are to be held under UN supervision.
To change our country politically all must participate and criticism must be allowed.
We call on all citizens of the German Democratic Republic to contribute to democratic renewal.
- How many do we have, Juliane?
- 110.
- We'll need a few more.
- We could be arrested for this, right?
- I've asked myself that too. - Right... According to Article 29, I think...
They can't repeal their own laws.
- Who is going to sign this?
- They're signing everywhere. But not here.
"In the current state of society, "the majority must contribute to the process of reform."
We have to talk.
- You should leave while you can.
- You can't stop it.
- Her perfume is still all over you.
- What does that matter now?
Don't change the subject.
How long has it been going on? Since Marco left the Sport Academy?
- How long do you think I'll take it?
- You're risking all we've built! What will the Party say about my wife supporting New Forum?
We wanted to create a future together.
Why abandon me now? Don't you realise you are abandoning us?
- You've lost all sense of reality.
- I have orders! So did your father.
Don't ever compare Walter with me.
Never! Never speak of us in the same breath!
If we got marching orders, you'd be in Schwedt.
Come on!
I didn't want to believe my wife was dead.
They showed me a bunch of photos. Of the accident, Anja...
Then I saw her with my own eyes.
I know what's going on inside you.
I know you love her... but we're under orders.
One little mistake and I'll forget I like you.
- Please go, Anja.
- I'm staying till you talk to me.
I've written it all in my letters.
How much I love you... Things you don't know about.
- I know it all! I've read your file.
- My file?
- That's not my file!
- Military area. Get back!
No, I won't!
It's a file they created about me.
It's the information they use to destroy families!
Corporal, you have your orders!
- Shut the gate!
- Get in.
Anja, sweetie.
Do you know which of the Opposition's slogans I like best?
"Stasi into Production."
You've never seen a state-owned enterprise from inside.
It would be a new experience for you.
If only you had croaked in Stalingrad.
If only you had croaked in Stalingrad, Father!
Mother and I got along so well till you showed up and sat down at the table in your stinking Nazi coat.
You represent everything I hated about Nazi Germany.
Everything I've done here was because of you.
Are you taking off to the West too?
You should know me better. That wouldn't solve anything.
What would I know? My wife's in the New Forum... she prints smears in her shop, and I face disciplinary action.
I always defended this family! Yes!
So that we'd have everything. Enough to eat.
Why is everyone betraying me?
Why me? Us? Our country?
Hasn't it looked after us?
They used batons on women, children, old people...
Beat and arrested them! You call that looking after them?
Do you know what will happen if we lose? They'll hang us!
What are you afraid of?
That the family who once lived here and could only emigrate by leaving the house to the State might want their house back?
Stop putting my things back! Out! Get out!
It's ridiculous!
We'll see who ends up ridiculous.
Where are you going?
- This is the home we built together! - That's what I thought once.
Hanna!
Get lost!
Everyone out!
- Honecker has resigned. - Can I stay with you?
Sure, as long as you want.
The 9th Central Committee Congress voted him in this afternoon.
- Come and see, they voted Krenz in!
...and head of the National Defence Council.
He headed the Electoral Commission.
And he personally congratulated his Chinese counterpart.
Work and more work, but work that makes everyone happy.
There's a demonstration in Berlin. You must be prepared for provocations.
You'll be under the command of the Border Guards.
Once they tell one lie, you can't believe them.
In the autumn of 1989 we rise from the ruins and turn towards the future.
Soon we shall again sing this song...
They're broadcasting this!
Wasn't Comrade Adamek instructed?
And I'm to justify myself to the Party?
This is counter-revolution!
And you criticise me! Only that your wife's in the New Forum, and the results.
Shit!
- We'll bring it to you later.
- Hands off!
This is my TV!
- I'll visit you as often as I can.
- No need. I have my TV.
This is my sector.
If you screw things up, you're out of here... for good.
Route step, march!
We believe that a party's claim to leadership must not be decreed by law.
One million, Hanna. Did you see their placards?
"On May Day, let the leaders parade past the people."
If anyone is left, that is.
15,000 have left the country within two days.
No joy in that. That's why they built the Wall.
Stop it!
We can be proud of what we've achieved.
...the principles of this concept must allow a free and open expression of one's opinion...
With this electoral law, we aspire to hold free general democratic elections by secret ballot, with every stage scrutinised...
Hi, Grandpa.
- Oh well... good, good...
They rolled one fellow out yesterday.
He didn't return. I'll outlive them all.
I believe you. I came to say goodbye.
I'm leaving.
For good. If I stay, I'll get sick.
Well...
I'm really sorry, my little one.
Therefore we have decided today to implement a regulation allowing every citizen of the GDR
to leave the GDR through any border crossing.
Private trips abroad can be made without the requirement to demonstrate need or prove family relationships. Effective immediately.
Go now.
Leave.
- Bye, Grandpa. - Get going!
...the reason for, let me put it this way, the fortified state border.
"Camera Live" reports the following.
Günther Schabowski informed the international media tonight.
He announced a new decision by the Council of Ministers regarding travel.
Citizens can travel abroad without seeking special permission.
Departments are instructed to issue visas without delay.
That's irrevocable. It's mad!
Permanent exit is possible via all GDR border crossings, including to West Berlin.
Exit via third countries will effectively cease.
There has been spontaneous reaction by Berliners.
They're yelling, "Open the Gate!" - We have to see this, Hanna. - Did you want this?
- It's the end.
- We couldn't have wanted this!
What meaning can the Wall still have?
- Hi! - Did you hear?
Hundreds have climbed onto the Wall to glimpse the other side.
Surrounded by cameramen and journalists an officer of the National People's Army is trying to clear the crowds.
Down with the Wall!
We want to cross!
Men!
Arms at the ready!
Stop! Shoulder arms! Without new orders, the old apply.
Border protection! Down with the Wall! You swore an oath!
To protect our citizens, not to shoot them!
We want to cross!
The border has been opened.
The People's Police are being overrun.
QUEEN TO PLAY
- Hello, Helene.
- Hello. Don't forget to do rooms 12 and 19.
- Have you seen Natalia?
- No. I don't know what I'd do without you, Helene.
I'm sick of that cow yelling at me!
I'm getting out of here.
- Where will you go?
- The mainland, anywhere.
What about Denis?
The love of your life?
He can come with me.
I'm not rotting away here!
The summer is okay... but the winter is a living hell!
Didn't you ever want to leave?
I never thought about it.
Never wanted to move somewhere else?
Yes, years ago. To move here and get married.
Nightmare!
Excuse me.
You can do the room now. We'll be out here all morning.
Yes, madam.
Do you play...
What's "chess" in French?
- Chess?
- Yes.
Do you play chess?
No.
Ange!
What's wrong?
An accident?
No. I just wanted to see you.
That's nice but you had me worried.
Shit, sorry.
Sure you're okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
I have to go, we have to finish today.
I'm behind.
Helene.
See you later.
When we were your age we had summer jobs. To earn some money.
My English teacher recommended this course.
So what?
Your mom and I work like slaves.
I don't want to be like you!
- Like what?
- Poor!
- Is it shameful?
- It's nothing to be proud of!
Has she ever gone without?
No! Calm down. You know she doesn't mean it.
Two building contracts were canceled.
Thierry may cut workers.
The people who earn money aren't spending it anymore.
How will we manage?
We'll see.
Did you ask your Yankee for a raise?
- How much is this trip to England?
- 400 euros.
Shit. We'll have to tighten our belts.
I'm meeting Jacky, we have a game to finish.
Don't wait up for me.
And he doesn't do anything. Nothing seems to interest him.
If you ask him what he wants to do... you know what he answers?
"I want to be famous!"
Doctor Kroger?
That man's impossible!
Does he give you a hard time too?
He's all right.
Lucky all my patients aren't like him!
Have a nice day.
Good-bye.
Hello, Doctor Kroger.
Please... try not to move everything. I can't find anything after you've been here.
I'm sorry. All right.
Do my room first.
I wanted to ask...
It's about my...
- About your?
- Salary. My husband thinks...
Does he think for you?
No, I think so too... You could give me a raise. 10 euros.
Thank you.
See you soon.
One, two, three!
Congratulations!
Happy birthday!
- Cut the cake!
- Right. Candles!
- Here.
- Happy birthday.
Birthday presents!
An electronic chess set.
So I see. What's it for?
Playing chess, I'd say!
- But I can't play.
- You can learn.
They say it improves the mind!
Very funny. Can you play?
No.
Okay!
It's a change from backgammon.
Who am I supposed to play with?
I don't know. With me?
Or on your own. It's a game you can play on your own.
On my own?
Tiny computer big brain!
Come on, let's have some cake.
Pass your plates.
Why did you do it?
Thanks, Helene.
- I hope it didn't cost too much?
Champagne!
- And champagne glasses!
- Right!
Where's the cork?
The cork for luck!
- It went well, huh?
- Very well.
Getting up in the morning will be tough.
Good night, love.
The knight...
The rook...
The pawn...
The king...
"One element that makes chess so rich... is the different movements of all the pieces.
The queen is the most powerful piece."
The queen is the most powerful piece...
Got everything?
I'm not going to Mars!
Here. Take it. You never know.
- Thanks. Are you sure?
- Yes.
Lisa! You'll miss your boat!
Coming!
- Be careful.
- I'm not a child!
That's what worries me!
- Come for a drink?
- Not today. You never come over now.
I don't have time. Bye.
It's you!
Yes, it's me.
Are you okay?
Yes.
- What were you doing?
- Nothing.
Smoking again?
A bit.
Call that a bit?
It helps me.
- Helps you do what?
- Think.
Think about what?
I haven't cooked. I thought we could go out for once.
On me.
I'm meeting Jacky, let's heat up a pizza.
I want to go out. Please.
All right, get changed. But it's on me.
We haven't been to Maddy's for ages.
So I kept my head down and... went back to work without a word.
It's every man for himself now.
When three people are fired we're angry, but we're glad it's them... and not us.
Maybe Lisa's right.
We've turned into sheep. But do we have a choice?
In my dad's day they all stuck together. The guys met up every Sunday.
Mom made doughnuts.
They drank, sang and changed the world!
It was fun.
If times got hard we resisted.
What were you saying?
Me?
We haven't talked like that for ages.
- Do you know what I'd like?
No, I'd like to...
- Is that what you want?
- Yes. Really?
What's the object of the game?
The object of the game?
You have to capture your opponent's king. And checkmate him.
And...?
And what?
- Is that all? - Yes.
So all the pieces move differently?
Except the pawns, they move the same way.
This is the bishop, we each have two.
They move diagonally, like this.
This is the rook. The rook goes straight ahead... or sideways if there's a place.
The queen. The most important piece.
She can do anything, go anywhere she likes.
She's stronger than the king. Crazy, right?
There. Got it?
Sure. You think I'm an idiot?
Okay, I'll begin. White always starts.
Your turn.
No, the knight does this. - The bishop moves sideways. - You never said that!
Yes, I did!
It doesn't make sense!
I've had enough.
Let's go to bed.
One last game.
I didn't wake you?
I'm sorry.
- Snooping through my things?
- What?
No, I...
Put it back where you found it. And stop saying sorry all the time. It's a sign of weakness.
Do you play?
Do I play chess?
- I do. - You?
I have an electronic set at home. I learn at night.
And sleep in the day.
Will you play with me?
I beg your pardon?
I'm not advancing on my own.
Why chess?
Why me?
I don't know who else to ask.
Try playing Patience.
Please.
Look...
- What's your name?
- Helene. Helene, right.
I don't like being bothered.
I can do the cleaning for free, if you like.
You're appealing to my better nature.
Tuesday, 4:00 p.m.
But let's make this clear:
We'll try it once. Only once. Understand?
What are you doing?
I'm coming!
Come and see.
Come and see.
- Know why room 11 is off limits?
- No.
She had a wild affair in that room three years ago. With an Italian guest.
He promised to come back. She goes in there every day. Pilgrimage!
Do you believe it?
She gets a monthly letter from Rome.
Denis told me.
Natalia, take the sheets... to the laundry, it's your turn today.
Four rooms must be ready by midday.
Can I count on you?
"Yes, Madam, very good, Madam!"
Don't exaggerate.
She's not bad at heart.
Sure!
You always say yes.
We have one hour. Do you intend to spend it standing up?
White opens. Your move.
Checkmate.
Well?
Well what?
Will you teach me?
Why does this game mean so much to you?
I don't know.
We'll start again.
See you Tuesday. And smile occasionally.
It suits you better than looking serious.
All right.
"Developing the queen early on is not advisable.
It helps... the enemy pieces to develop... and they can quicken the pace by attacking her.
It's vital... not to waste time right from the start... so your development is not delayed."
Do you look at everyone like that?
Like what?
As if your life depends on what they're going to say.
Rules are less important than exceptions in chess.
Breaking rules at a timely moment:
that's what you have to do. Do you understand?
Not really, no.
Neither do I.
Shall we continue?
Helene!
Have you seen the time?
We won't go into that today.
Imagine, our Natalia... has been short-listed for her competition!
Really?
Well done!
Well, I haven't won yet.
We're 200, they only pick 10.
If I get in I do a ritzy training course on the mainland... and I'll kiss... all this good-bye!
She's going to Marseille for 2 days for the oral... and I have no one to replace her.
Can you work 2 afternoons next week?
- When?
- Tuesday and Wednesday.
No.
I can't do Tuesday.
I'm sorr... I'm not free.
It's me.
Hello.
Shall I start with...
What?
You want to do the cleaning?
- But you pay me to do it.
- No.
I pay you to do what I tell you.
Come on.
Fifteen minutes.
And today... I open.
E4, c5.
Sweetheart!
You look lovely.
Where were you?
We were worried!
I was at Kroger's. I missed my bus.
His place must be clean!
Forgotten your daughter?
Don't fight the day I get back!
You're right.
We're going home.
Try and find time to come over. We have to talk.
Okay. See you later.
Bye.
We went to London for the day.
And we ran out of the museum, just the two of us.
It was awesome.
And he raped me three times.
Who?
Okay. I tell you I've fallen in love for real... you don't even listen!
I do!
It's Antoine, isn't it?
You slept with him?
You say I've changed, but you've changed.
I'm not hungry.
Let's go!
The ends, as usual?
No, I'd like some little strands. You know?
All over.
But they won't be the same length.
I don't want them the same length. They won't stay in a chignon.
I know.
You can tell me, you know.
Tell you what?
You and Doctor Kroger.
Look straight!
- Everyone's talking.
- About what?
You don't go over there just to clean.
Be careful, Helene.
He's a strange man.
When his wife died there were rumors... Nothing was ever proved. But he didn't want to see anyone afterwards.
Don't you remember?
No.
Checkmate!
Checkmate, you're right.
- Well done.
- Thank you.
It's late. You should be home by now.
Yes. Anyway, I missed the last bus.
Shall we have a drink?
Won't your husband say anything?
Yes.
What's he like?
Ange?
He's... handsome.
- Handsome?
- Yes. Really handsome.
So many books.
Too many.
Have you read them all?
Most of them.
Do you like reading?
I don't know, I never read.
"Martin Eden."
Take it. You'll like it.
All right?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Well... go on.
Your wife was beautiful.
Very.
Did you play chess with her too?
No.
It's not true what they say? That you helped her die?
Did they tell you that?
And you believed it?
No.
You've changed your hair.
I have to go now.
- See you Tuesday?
- Yes.
You all right?
What did you eat?
Pasta. It's all we could find.
- Enjoy yourself?
- What?
You sail in, it's nearly midnight. Happy and pretty, did you enjoy yourself?
Have you been drinking?
No. Yes. I couldn't get drunk.
I'll make some coffee.
They all say you're two-timing me.
It's tough but I don't care.
You know it's not true.
What I saw today is worse.
What did you see?
You and Kroger.
You followed me?
He pays you, at least?
What do you mean?
I'm trying to understand.
Don't bother!
So you had pasta for supper?
It didn't kill you!
Can't I have something of my own for once?
It's not a crime!
Come in.
You wanted to see me?
Sit down.
What's been going on?
Two weeks ago... the Belgian couple complained... that you hadn't changed the towels for two days.
Yesterday... the guest in room 9 sent for me to see how badly his bed was made.
Then this morning room 12 said you were rude... when he asked you for mineral water.
What's wrong?
I'm a maid, not a waitress.
You're what I pay you to be.
If the job isn't good enough for you... lots of people out there would snap it up.
I run this place alone. I can't accept sloppiness.
All right.
Lisa?
- What's wrong...
- Leave me alone.
Tell me about it.
It's Antoine, isn't it?
Has he hurt you?
He wants us to break up.
Why?
He's with someone else.
Didn't he tell you?
Yes. But he thought it was over.
Then when he got back he saw her again.
Oh, my darling.
I can see his point. Why should he be with a working class girl?
What do you mean?
Antoine is middle class!
His girlfriend is middle class.
You know something?
I'm glad it's over. I couldn't have brought him here. It's too tacky!
Stop it.
I never told him you're a cleaner.
I don't want to end up like you!
Lisa, go to bed.
You both disgust me!
You're right. I ruin everything.
Don't.
Don't.
No, I'm not sick. I'm not coming over anymore.
I've decided... I'm not playing chess anymore.
Because it's impossible. It's too complicated.
I'm not coming over anymore. Not even for the cleaning.
Good-bye.
Hello, Jacky.
Hi.
"The real world was that of his mind... and the stories he wrote the only possible reality."
I found this in your room.
Have you read it?
It made me cry.
Beautiful. The sailor who became a writer.
You mean the writer who should have stayed a sailor.
Why do you say that?
Because he's unhappy. Because he realizes it wasn't worth the effort. And he doesn't belong anywhere.
Yes, but he did it.
If he's an outsider, it's because he's better than those he tried to impress.
Why be better if you don't do anything with it?
It must have been hard when you moved here.
Yes, a bit.
I'd left everything, no friends.
I spent my time waiting for your father.
No more chess?
That's silly!
Why not? It's not a women's game.
That annoys me. Like men are smarter than us!
The most powerful piece is the queen, right?
How do you know?
I just know.
Show me how you danced with your friend Ouidad.
Come on, Mom!
If you've come here to clean... take your flowers and go. I've found someone else.
Shall we start?
What do you mean?
Let's play.
I'll be white?
I bet you've been practicing on your own.
Come on!
I can't wait forever!
Is this what you came back for?
Of course. What else?
Shall we play blitz?
Want to know something?
What?
I didn't miss you but I'm glad you're here.
I didn't miss you either.
Hey!
What's going on?
I thought I'd cook the chicken. Disaster!
- Can I help?
- No, let me. I'll do it.
I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to you too.
Oh yes?
What about?
I've been thinking. You're right. This can't go on.
What?
I want to see you happy.
It was my present, right?
You can't throw it away.
Lisa will be back soon.
Checkmate in 2 moves.
Five times running.
I give up.
It's just luck, that's all.
Luck has nothing to do with it, as we both know.
You know...
I think the time has come.
The time for what?
You have to spread your wings.
I've been thinking about it for a while. A tournament.
Me?
A little tournament. Not the world championship. Not yet.
You're tired of me?
I didn't say that.
But I like playing with you.
How can you say that?
You've never played with anyone else.
Admit you're scared, you feel safe here.
That's not true!
Anyway, I'm not ready.
Of course you're ready.
And the next tournament is in 2 months... it gives us some time.
Don't imagine you can get rid of me like that!
You could have told me. We made it clear.
Play here or at Kroger's but don't look like a fool in public!
Why would she?
Know what people call you?
"The chess case".
I don't care.
You don't care if I look like a fool?
You should be proud of her... instead of making our lives hell!
You know something?
I admire Mom.
Not many people could do it.
She has to start training.
Sleep a lot, eat well. So she'll be in top form.
It's not a sport.
Yes, it is!
And first prize is 1500 euros.
Since you're both ganging up on me!
It's a shame I can only take one at a time.
Very funny.
Why are you doing that?
See your plan through.
But it's lousy.
Better to play a lousy plan logically... than no plan at all.
It's too tough.
It's work.
No, it's not.
Work is when I do cleaning.
Here I understand less and less.
- That's part of it.
- Of what?
The work.
What do you know?
You lock yourself up with your books.
Is that work?
It's a luxury.
It saves me from rubbing shoulders with idiots.
It's easy to despise everyone.
Not everyone.
I liked it better before.
Before what?
When I didn't question anything.
How very inspiring!
- There you are. You all right?
- Fine.
"Natalia, you've forgotten the towels. You have to knock some sense into your head!"
I better stop laughing at her, I'm not going anywhere.
I flunked the oral. I totally messed up. I was scared stiff.
You can try for it again.
I could but... I was dreaming too big.
Denis wants us to get married now and have kids. Four!
That's what matters. A husband you love, a family, a quiet life.
- Right?
- Yes.
We better go!
I still have rooms 12 and 9 to do.
Yes, me too.
Come in.
Just a minute.
I'll see to that.
We'll settle it next week, okay?
Yes?
It's about the tournament. I want to enter.
- Do you belong to a club?
- No.
Have you played for long?
No, not very.
Are you rated?
Rated?
Although it's an amateur tournament the standards are very high.
Doctor Kroger sent me, he's written to you.
Kroger?
A friend of yours?
Yes...
Please sit down.
You're his cleaning lady?
Yes, why?
No reason.
- Is that all he says?
- Pretty much.
Should he have said anything else?
He's always done what he likes with people.
Would you have time to work for me?
My wife needs someone.
Two afternoons a week, if it's possible?
I'll have to see.
Is something wrong today?
No, everything's fine.
It doesn't look like it.
Aren't you playing?
No. I do the cleaning. After all, I am your cleaning lady.
As you said in your letter.
So that's it?
You played with me like a puppet.
I may not be educated, but I have my pride.
I'm not your plaything.
You're right. You're not my plaything.
I'm sorry. I should never have written that.
But it's the truth too:
you are my cleaning lady.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving. I want my money.
I hate you.
Stay. I want to show you something.
You see those pictures?
My wife painted them. She was talented, wasn't she?
Extremely talented. But she never believed in herself.
When she died I thought... I should have encouraged her more.
I thought I could have saved her.
But that's just vanity again. No one can save anyone else.
Her doubt was stronger than her painting.
Do you understand?
You hurt me.
Yes. You are really talented, Helene.
You have... that thing that can't be taught... at school or in books... money can't buy it... many people search for it without ever finding it.
Myself included.
Will you come to the tournament?
Go away.
Are you all right?
Leave.
Go!
Black hit the game clock.
Good luck everybody!
Rook... Move your rook... from c8 to c4...
He'll have to trade the pawn.
Not that it helps him... as you'll take it with the rook.
Checkmate.
Bravo!
- Has she won?
- Did she win?
She's won!
Dad!
Dad!
What is it?
Has she lost?
She won four games, she's in the final.
What's next?
It hasn't started yet. Coming?
No. If she sees me it'll throw her. You go.
- Keep me posted.
- Sure.
5:00. Time to start. Good luck everybody!
What's going on?
He's late. It's a tactic to destabilize her.
That's awful!
You ask too many questions. It's only a game. So play.
Be yourself and enjoy it.
One bad move... can wipe out 40 good previous moves. So force him to slip up.
And remember:
"The threat is always stronger... than the execution. "
She's won!
Sorry, I'm late agai n.
It doesn't matter, Natalia.
Here's our champion.
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.
Let's stand in front of the hotel.
I'm sorry, I only want the winner.
Oh, all right.
The winner of what?
Hold it.
Smile.
You're a star now.
Not bad.
I thought you'd come. I was waiting for you.
But you won, didn't you?
You see... you didn't need me.
The next tournament is in Paris. I'm going.
It's always been your dream?
Well... It will be different. There'll be top players.
We'll see.
"When you take a risk you may lose... when you don't take a risk you always lose."
Right?
So I have managed to teach you something.
When I get back... we'll start again?
You know I hate losing.
Then play better!

BLUEBEARD
Anne de Rocligon. Yes, come on.
Why are we going to the Mother Superior?
I don't know.
Sister Barbe, you listen to the doors.
You know everything.
I assure you, I know nothing.
The lie by omission is a sin.
But I don't sin. I know nothing at all.
- Where is Marie-Catherine?
- She's not here?
Sister Barbe, you always respond to a question.
Sorry, my mother. I had warned her.
Find me that child and make haste.
Right away, my mother.
Mademoiselle Anne, you are witness.
The time, it's time. We strive to teach you.
Your little sister did not assimilate this elementary courtesy, which is the courtesy of kings.
It's simply bad manners.
Do you have the right to come here?
Mother didn't forbid us.
But it's me who should watch over you.
You say...
Don't go too quickly, Catherine.
I love looking around.
Can we really come here?
It's an extraordinary place for me.
Come look at this old book.
It's mine!
Alright.
Alright. We'll exempt ourselves from waiting for her.
Nevertheless, I'll ask you to be very courageous and strengthen your faith for the degree of this tragedy.
Mademoiselle, your Lord, in His great goodness, has chosen to take back...
I said...
Your Lord, in His great goodness, chose to take back your father.
He threw himself under the wheels of a cart to save a child.
Don't cry for his loss, but rejoice in the glory of his sacrifice.
He has joined the kingdom of heaven.
Come on. Hasn't one of you learned strength of character?
No show of useless tears.
Don't return to your classes. Get in your dorms. You will take care of all your affairs.
Your condition does not allow you to stay here longer. We're a private school, not a charity organization.
Yes!
I won, I won, na na na.
Yes.
There it is. You lost.
- No. It's behind the armchair. - That's it.
What do you think?
If it's not there, we do another.
You're already all dirty.
It's as if you want to be dirty.
You're a tattletale.
It's me, the big sister.
Ooh la la!
Ooh la la!
You're never happy.
Now, get in the car.
Your father will always watch over you from the heavens.
- We don't say goodbye?
- Useless.
May God watch over you.
Anne, look.
This is so beautiful.
It's incredible that that could belong to someone.
How was it constructed?
Carrying all the rocks up...
There are the miserable ones who sweat, and there are the rich.
Someday, I'll live in a huge castle.
Always dream. This is the work of war.
A strong place against invasions.
What invasions?
There are always some. Barbarity is everywhere.
Jeannot, to whom does the castle belong?
To Bluebeard. A very rich lord, but very bloody with all the women.
Why?
His spouses all disappeared at the end of a year.
He had to kill them.
- Don't listen. - It interests me.
There are also girls who disappeared.
Why doesn't he go to prison?
The justice of the rich and the justice of the poor.
- That's not justice, then. - Yes.
You never understand anything.
Yes. I will become very rich.
Ah yes? How?
- It's none of your business.
- You're delirious.
Yes. But the mother superior, I'll have her strangled,
I'll suspend her by her hair and watch her die, and join the kingdom of heaven.
Stop.
Dad has just died.
It's nervous.
I can't believe he's dead.
Nevertheless, we'll all end up like that.
Don't come in. You're too little.
Anne!
Anne!
Anne, come over here!
Anne...
Why did you put on that dress?
You should never wear a dress like that.
Quick, quick!
Come on!
Come on, help me.
What will become of you?
Two girls...
How could I marry you off?
Your father hasn't left us anything. Only debts.
You'll have to enter the convent.
It's the only solution.
No thank you. I'd as soon be buried alive.
He hears us.
He hears us!
He could have taken care of us.
You act as if he wasn't your father.
I'd rather die.
Why did you tint all your clothing?
You want to bury us with dad, is that it?
He's dead, at least!
He chose it. I did not choose to be the living dead.
I don't know how mom grooms you. You're really ugly.
- What are you doing?
- I'm making you a little more beautiful.
Ouch!
Be careful.
I'm making you a bit prettier. Mom has no taste.
There. You're prettier.
Ooh la la...
- I'll be the one to read.
- Again?
I cry when he wants to kill her.
- But he can't kill her. - That makes me cry.
I'm sensitive.
"The Little Siren," you'll weep too.
The end is better.
Are you starting?
- "The Little Siren" or "Bluebeard"?
- "Bluebeard."
"There once was a man who had beautiful houses
"in the city and in the country, beautiful dishes,
"with embroidered furnishings and guilded designs.
"But he had a blue beard."

Daddy dear...
You're handsome like that.
You seem younger.
You resemble a statue. A very cold statue.
All the more intimidating.
I love you.
I'm saying goodbye.
It doesn't scare me to see him dead.
He's much more handsome.
You aren't going to kiss him?
I want him to be dead.
I want him dead.
- He didn't do it deliberately.
- Yes.
He chose to save a child.
He didn't think about us, how he risked making us orphans.
We didn't matter.
He didn't think about us for a second.
I hate him. With all my soul.
You always want to be loved. You love nobody.
Don't reproach him for listening to his heart.
Fool!
I reproach who I want.
It's his fault if he's dead, not mine.
She's a fool.
She knows not what she says.
When God has time, he'll take him to heaven.
We bury the dead on earth because God has work to do.
- Do you believe that dad could die?
- Yes.
Would we no longer have a house?
Yes. It's being kept for us. He wouldn't have any more need.

This family disgusts me.
She doesn't say what she thinks. She's miserable.
"One of their neighbors, a woman of quality, had two girls.
"He asked her for one in marriage.
"She would decide which girl to give to him.
"Neither of the girls wanted him,
"not being able to resolve to take a man with a blue beard."
Do you understand?
Bluebeard, very ugly but very rich,
- one must be poor to love him.
- No. A woman of quality isn't so poor.
Keep reading.
Alright.
Take these, mother.
Like that, you'll run out of energy.
What a state your arms are in!
Are there two girls without a dowry of age to get married?
It's cruel to scoff at a family that knows misery.
My girls have no dowry. Who will want them?
Bluebeard.
I'll never give him one of my girls.
If you'd told me that, I wouldn't have received you.
Come on.
You no longer have the means to make due with difficulties.
Nothing is so terrible, look around you.
Sir Bluebeard is rich.
He would be generous with you.
If you devote yourself to him, your fortune is made.
Think about it. I've told you all you need to know.
Don't refuse this deal.
I know him.
Sir Bluebeard knows how to make himself... presentable.
He sends you an invitation to meet him and choose between the young girls.
You see, you're obligated nothing if you accept.
Let's go visit the big castle.
I'm sensitive.
You're even afraid of what's not true.
No.
I'm not scared. I'm sick.
That hurts my ears.
- You say it doesn't matter.
- It's not my fault.
It's my brain that reflects.
- Your brain is yours.
- No, it was given to me.
Alright. Can I resume my reading?
"He had already married several women.
"No one knew what became of them.
"Bluebeard, to make himself known,
"led them with their mother, three of their best friends,
"and kids from the neighborhood to one of his country houses.
"where they stayed eight days."
If you hadn't tinted my dress, I'd feel a little better.
They'll make fun of us.
It's simple, I'm ashamed.
I want to leave.
Wearing mourning clothes is not shameful.
I don't care about others.
This beautiful young lady having fun...
- They're of age.
- They're not bad.
Our host puts on a good show.
It's better than nothing.
He's not appetizing.
If he believes in marrying someone young...
He has the choice.
And we won't choose him.
Do you never dance?
What would I seem like?
It's necessary to be aware of who you are.
You like to see them dance without you?
They have fun by themselves.
I like to be surrounded by young people having fun.
Go on, dance, you too.
No one invites me.
As if I didn't exist.
They will.
My sister is more beautiful.
Your roles will be reversed. You must only wait.
Me, I won't change.
- I am a monster.
- Surely not!
They look at me like a monster.
I understand.
In effect, I become a monster. A sort of ogre, do you understand?
Yes.
And don't I scare you?
No.
I'm more afraid of the invisible wickedness.
"The younger daughter found that the master was an honest man.
"Upon returning to the city, the marriage was concluded.
No.
She's too young.
No, she's old.
Before, they got married as early as birth.
You're nuts.
They got married even at 5 years.
But it was different when they married bigger.
I don't know how.
Wait, I'm thinking.
- You're pretending.
- No. I'm thinking.
Is that alright, Mademoiselle?
That seems perfect to me.
- There won't be a more beautiful bride.
- No.
I'd like to show myself to my sister. She's not going to come back.
Be careful!
- You'll ruin my work.
- No.
Anne, Ida, look.
This is the first dress made for me.
A dress that no one wore.
That's a change, no?
- She seems beautiful suddenly.
- I can't believe it.
- She thinks herself there, poor girl.
- This Bluebeard is so ugly.
- I pity her.
- Not me.
She is jealous.
She dreams of surpassing you.
That will teach her.
Anyway, she's so young.
That breaks my heart.
What do you want to happen to him?
What are you plotting?
Nothing. You are transfigured.
Mademoiselle, come back!
Marie-Catherine, come back immediately!
You're incapable of keeping your own clothing.
I'm a pig. I always get dirty.
Starting tomorrow, I'll do what I want.
I can't wait.
Mademoiselle, I must finish the alterations!
I'm coming.
You'll come see me.
You won't abandon me.
There's more reason to than not.
Plenty. But I like it that way.
- I love you when you play the victim.
- Me too.
I treated you poorly.
I didn't care.
I devastated your room and you were scolded.
The marriage of Bluebeard is difficult because he kills children.
He has a huge pot in which he cooks children, a small trap door to recover the eggs and a ladle to recover the girl. And then, he eats her.
That's how he gets fatter.
And he meets a green ogress with big teeth.
You're mixing everything up.
You're an idiot.
Ah yes?
What is it then, your marriage?
It's when two people love each other. In front of everyone, they put beautiful rings on each other.
And an ogress comes to eat them.
Stop with the ogress!
The bride has a beautiful wedding gown.
- And she becomes an ogress.
- Stop it!
- She's beautiful.
- Bluebeard devours everyone.
Is your beard really blue?
You won't be scared, will you?
I didn't expect it.
I like it better like this.
- You're a strangle little person.
You never laughed reading that. - I laugh in my head.
- It doesn't matter.
Ah no.
If mom saw that, she'd be furious.
I didn't sleep with you before you were old.
What did I do wrong?
I had this little bed purchased. I'm not a dog.
You must snore like an ogre.
If I don't have my own room in such a castle,
I'll return to live with mom until I turn 20. I thought it was the right thing to do. I want a room of my own size.
At the house, I had to slide into my sister's bed.
I was the last one.
Here.
There.
This shelf is unworthy of you. I'd like to see.
You're sure that it suits you?
This will be my room. I want no other. Other pieces are more sumptuous.
When I come of age.
Here, this will be my secret place.
I want to keep reading.
This is Fomitopsis pinicola.
That, that's a Boletus piperatus.
Repeat.
- Boletus piperatus.
- Boletus piperatus.

It's my sister Anne who sang it. I like her a lot, your voice.
It's very simple. I sing false.
Not for me.
If you had heard Anne...
You're depressed, without your sister.
No. But she misses me.
But I'm delighted to be rid of her.
"Bluebeard tells his wife
"that he had to travel in the province for at least 10 weeks
"for an important matter."
The keys to two large furniture depositories.
The one for the gold dishware and for the money.
The one to my safes, with my gems.
The master key that opens all the apartments.
Open everything.
Go everywhere. It's all for you.
Smile, don't make that face. - I'm sad to see you leave. - Come on now.
I don't like to see anyone anymore.
I'm an old scalded wolf, unexcited by anything.
Your beard stopped being blue.
Don't you like it better?
Less. I was used to it.
- Look me in the eyes.
Where is my wife?
Isn't luxury every day wearying, with no one to share it with?
No. I'm used to it.
I don't even notice it anymore.
As if I always lived like this.
I couldn't do it any other way.
It seems like you've forgotten my return. But it was so long, so endless...
I was so sad.
You ordered me to have fun.
You're here, and I didn't wait for you. What a magnificent surprise. Oh, I'm so happy!
Do you remember my first time here?
Tonight, it's even more beautiful.
It's like I'm in the den of a secular eagle, made to protect me.
I never ate enough.
I'm there. "The Chinese remembered one eclipse "that occurred under emperor Chung Kang
"during the time of the fall equinox, "the year 2155 B.C.
"According to them, in about 2500 B.C.,
"five planets were brought together in the same constellation,
"and the same day, they observed the new moon.
"They wondered if it had arrived."
But, you see, the calculations that corroborate Professor Kirsch's findings make the thing without a doubt.
They placed the conjunction in 2443 B.C.
You'll teach me everything.
I'm so ignorant. I'll teach you everything I can.
But you must also learn by reading.
That will occupy you during the time of my next absence.
You know that I must set off again soon.
For very long again? Yes, long, my child.
I regret having to abandon you. Take me.
I can't.
It's useless. I won't have parties anymore.
You'll do what your heart tells you. Did I scold you last time?
I'll invite my sister.
No one else.
I'm giving you these keys for whatever use you want.
But on the other hand, this small key, this is the one to the office at the end of the gallery of the low stairway.
But I forbid you from entering there.
"She promised to observe all that was ordered for her.
"He, after kissing her, "climbs on his horse and leaves for his trip.
"As if urged by the curiosity,
"she descended a robed staircase
"with so much haste she thought she'd break her neck.
"But she could not overcome the temptation.
"She took the small key and opened the office door.
She saw nothing, for the windows were closed."
I'm not scared. I'm not scared...
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.
You, Monsieur?
You left only yesterday.
My return doesn't distress you, I hope?
I didn't expect to see you so soon.
We'll eat something then. I'm very hungry too.
We can't exempt ourselves from this rule.
Of course.
You have done what was forbidden.
I didn't enter.
Why is there blood on this key?
I don't know anything.
You don't know anything?
But I know, I do.
You wanted to enter the office. And well, Madame, you will enter there too. You will take your place among those ladies.
Forgive me.
I truly repent having disobeyed you.
Anne!
My sister Anne, don't you see anything coming?
Come on, Madame.
You must die. Please. One more minute.
It's time to die.
I don't protest it.
I would only want to die holding onto my marriage.
When I hadn't upset you, you were so good to me.
"My sister Anne, don't you see anything coming?
"I see, she replied, two horsemen
"are coming from the side, but are still far away.
I'll make signs for them to come faster."
- Hello, Germain.
- Hi, Paulo.
Missing money!
- Yes, I forgot to tell you that besides asshole, you're a thief, it's missing money!
It would have been enough, if your work was finished.
- Get lost!
- What? I finished the job.
You thought it'll take ten hours, but I completed the job in eight.
This is Shit! Shit!
Here, you bastard!
Pig!
- Go away, jerk!
- Shut up, you thief!
That's not all.
There were ten hours, he owes me two hours.
One, two, three, four,
- Five, six ...
- Nineteen.
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, young man, there are nineteen.
- What's funny?
- That you called me young man.
You are a young man compared to me.
- Do you come here often?
- Almost every day of the Lord.
But something puzzles me.
Why do you count the pigeons?
Well, to see if any missing, or if there are some new.
See that small with white feather on the wing?
That one is new, it wasn't there on Saturday.
Yes, I noticed. I called it White Feather.
- You also give them names? - Yes, to recognize them.
If you look carefully, no two are alike.
All have their own personality, like the kids.
Do you have children?
No, do you?
Although, if I you had children... You couldn't confuse them.
If they were nineteen, not so sure.
Let's see tell me the name of the other.
The others: we have
Pedrito and a Bow Tie, always smooching.
This next is Stubborn.
There is Cookie.
The one who always wants to go first is Johnny.
The one with a pen in his beak is Thief.
Always stealing feathers.
And the little one playing smart
That's called Marguerite.
- Well, like me.
- Really?
Yes, my name is Marguerite, with two tees.
It was my father who registered it so.
Could not write very well.
My mother insisted on keeping it like that.
I liked it.
I am the fruit of a love story.
- Well, like everyone else.
- No, not all.
Some are the result of carelessness.
Well, gotta go.
Perhaps we meet again.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir... your name?
Chazes, Germain Chazes.
Mr. Chazesen I am delighted having met you.
Thanks for introducing me to your large family.
Do not leave your bag there, these brats will snatch it.
There isn't much inside.
Yes, but... That is not written on it.
- Hello, Germain.
- It's my birthday, a glass!
- A good sparkling wine.
- It is "Blanc de blancs."
And how old are you now?
That I can'ty say, it's a State secret.
- Hello, Yusef.
- You look older.
- How so?
- Please!
- Screw you!
- Asshole, my shoes!
Mr. Landremont, want a glass?
Thanks, my dear friend. Never alcohol, water for me.
So... King beheaded, five letters...
Spaghetti with tomato!
Look at the chick there.
- I see nothing.
- It's the nurse from the ambulance.
- It drives me crazy, but I do not know how ...
- Capet! Louis Capet, Louis XVI, beheaded in 1793.
- Which one?
- The one in pink.
Today's special, Two cheeses in one.
That's not the dish of the day!
- Who is the spaghetti for?
- The girl in the window. Leave it to me.
I will never see you again.
Don't bother.
You are a perfect bastard, a bastard.
That suits you just fine.
- Spaghetti?
- For me. Will you let me talk?
Let me talk!
Stop talking, can't hear you.
- And to drink?
- A glass of red wine.
Yeah, yeah, you know what?
I can't hear you. - Excuse me, are you Marie-Christine?
- No, Stephanie.
No, I said it.
Perfect, she broke up with the boyfriend.
Francine, a glass of Cote de Rhone.
- Ready for this? She's called Stephanie.
- Stephanie?
- You'll bring her the wine.
- Are you crazy?
Now? - Sure now!
Wanna wait for tomorrow morning?
Francine, put everything on my account.
And when are you going to pay?
It is a State secret, ciao!
Secret Defense.
Yusef!
- What?
- Come.
Have you finished all that blabber?
. - Come on, it's the environment.
- Sure. - For the domino table.
- Do you love me? Give me a kiss.
- Come on.
- Not now.
Oriente Maupassant.
One, two, three, four.
Oriente ... A guide.
Guy de Maupassant.
Do not you have thought, sure, Guy de Maupassant.
Sure, the Guide Maupassant It's like the Guide Michelin.
No, the Guide Maupassant?
Come on, that's a good one!
Guy de Maupassant like the Michelin Guide?
- What an ass!
- What?
No, nothing.
Damn! That's enough, stupid mechanic!
Let's see, Chazes. Don't you know the answer?
Is Mr. Chazes gone fishing?
The problem of Chazes is an empty head
Very, very empty, I think.
Am I wrong, Chazes?
Got Mail!
Got Mail!
Fuck. OK, I'm leaving it here.
Not funny.
Bravo, you moron!
- I will clean it, Ms. Chazes.
- No, leave it.
Move!
No more nonsense.
At birth, had to get it out with forceps.
Ten hours of torture so big it was!
Ten pounds!
Do you know how much is ten pounds?
Five kilos!
It amounts to this, a bag of potatoes, rice, oil and margarine.
To end up with that.
That thing eats, costs money, is dirty.
It's all the satisfaction I get?
"That."
Refer to a human as "it."
I would not call "it" a dog.
If you have dog, you say "dog".
- It's me. - Yes, yes..
People should think twice before making children.
A child is not like a dog to be abandoned on the side of a road.
What are you mumbling about, honey?
I mumble because... I think that....
To hell with it.
You think what?
In families with tender moments
Where they tousle your hair saying "It's the spitting image of his father."
I'm not a portrait of anyone.
In any case, not of a pair of balls.
Do not talk like that about father.
What do you expect?
In fifteen words I say twelve of profanity
Words that spoil everything.
It's what I know, I can't speak otherwise of my father.
I had no example to follow.
I had to figure it all alone.
What? I'm glad that you exist.
Every day I say I have luck.
- Luck why?
- Because I love you, my darling.
I like to be inside you.
It's where I'm better, so soft, warm ...
As if it were silk.
Or feathers.
Have you heard the guide Maupassant?
- Hey, Germain.
- What?
Who is it?
Julien.
Come help, it's Landremont.
He cries, screams, he wants to kill himself.
Shit.
I'm coming!
Stupid Landremont, goes crazy from time to time.
Since his wife died.
- How long ago?
- Three years, had cancer. Shit.
He calls for help and then he won't open, the idiot.
- You had people?
- Annette.
- Sorry. - I'm sick!
Everyone gets on my nerves.
That simple!
- Open!
Landremont!
Everyone to hell, is that clear?
Open up, dammit!
You won't bring her back by doing all this.
She's dead already.
- Do not say it.
- What?
- It's worse. - I can not anymore.
- Sure, all will be well, if you open.
- Open. Come! You don't want us to break the window.
Of course not, come.
Come on, give it to me, don't be a jerk.
Now, now.
- I'm going to piss you guys.
- Okay, go, go.
- He did it again. - Excuse me.
Germain!
I can't believe it!
That again?
I've had enough!
Yes again! Why do you errase it every time?
- It is a public monument.
- And why can't my name be on like the rest?
It is reserved for the dead Don't you understand?
Should I be dead to have my name on?
Yes, and dead at war.
That's a good one.
For God's sake, tell me why you do that? .
I don't give a shit..
Good morning, Mr. Chazes.
- Are all?
- Yes, all.
Would you like to read?
I had the opportunity, but it did not happen.
Crabs, enough!
- How are you called?
- Crabs.
I don't understand.
Lice, if you prefer.
Are you referring to pubic lice?
Yes...
We also say that of kids, they cling to us like leeches, it's enerving.
Yes, yes, I see comparison with crabs.
That is, you got it.
Yes, I did understand you.
Speaking of,
My friend Zecouk Jojo has a parrot that he named De Gaulle because that parrot always says:
"I understood, I understood."
Your friend is a chef?
- Do you know Jojo?
- No, I didn't have that pleasure.
How did you know he's a cook?
You just called him Jojo "The Cook".
"The Cook" in English means Le Chef.
Zecouk means ...?
Sure, sure.
Of course, as the butcher called pâté and the carpenter, Plank.
Jojo Le Chef, but in English.
But, of course!
I bet even he doesn't know that.
Jojo, with that name, you did well becaming a cook. - What?
- That's it.
- Give me a hand.
- Let me take it, where?
At the center, we have a wedding tonight.
Hey, Landremont.
Fortunately, Jojo is a cook.
Look, it's called Zecuk.
- What are you telling me?
- Don't you understand?
Zecuk means "cook" in English.
Don't you get it? Over your head, you're really thick.
This guy is impossible..
Germain, my last name is Pelletier.
My name is Joël Pelletier.
"The Cook" is because I was in England.
It's a nickname.
- My name is Pelletier.
That one is a nickname. - OK, OK.
Yeah, as when you're being called "The Moron."
Don't you feel like peeing again?
Stop that, Germain isn't more of moron than you all.
Besides, he's the nicest.
What would you like, Germain?
A glass of white.
Francine, the market on Wednesday, would you lend me the Van?
Sure, like every Wednesday.
Hello, Germain.
Wow, what a perfume! Going to a date?
- Yes, a date with me.
Stéphanie.
Hello, Stéphanie, this is Julien.
Julien is second to none, What do you think of him?
You will love him.
- More than a lot. - Germain, stop that.
- He's timid, doesn't dare telling you
- That's embarrassing.
Stay with him, is a good guy.
- Plenty of girls after him, believe me.
- Germain.
Go help Jojo bring tomatoes from the garden.
We need some, right Jojo?
- But there are plenty of tomatoes feft. - No, there are not.
It's urgent. Ah, I get it.
Come, Germain.
See you, Stephanie.
Look at her.
Go ahead, help yourself, feel free.
When I give to her, she throws them to my face. away She prefers stealing them.
- It is not nice what you do.
- You plant them in my house, I might as well use them.
You smoke too much, how many times I tell you.
So don't tell me, shut up, especially you.
I wouldn't not want to be the son of a mother like that.
I did not choose her, neither she chose me.
I understand now why you moved out of that house.
Why are you staying so close with your caravan?
- Go further away.
- I can go to the end of the world.
Between my mother and I the distance is in our head.
It's something ...it's...
- It's symbolic.
- That's it, symbolic.
Besides, my garden is here.
Come and see.
I've planted it all, by myself.
Look, cabbages.
Endive, leeks.
Look at the greenhouse, I built it myself.
Would you like tomatoes?
Choose yourself.
Beef heart, Crimean black.
And look at these.
- Well, what are these?
- Tomato Marmande. Exactly.
Come on, ladies look how tomatoes go.
The best tomatoes leeks and turnips!
What a lettuce, oak, batavia, curly.
- Ah, like the young lady. - Thanks for the "young lady".
- What would you like?
- Four leeks.
Pick them yourself, Here, the large ones.
- Do not have a melon?
- No, melons are there. Cloclo, Cloclo!
To accompany the melon, Mr. Seguin has a special wine.
There, four large ones, it's 2.20.
Do you have 20?
Okay, I have exact thank you very much.
Thank you!
Pretty and curly.
Remember, we'll bring melons on Friday.
- I have a blood test on Friday.
- Another?
That nurse is a vampire.
How is she with you?
- Evasive.
- It's better than nothing.
Come, come.
Hello, pretty blonde.
- It's taken.
- What? - It's taken.
- What you mean taken?
What guts!
- Good afternoon, Mr. Chazes.
- You can call me Germain, if you like.
- Really?
- Sure.
I will only do it, if you call me Margueritte.
If you insist, I don't mind.
- Agreed.
- Fine, then.
I'm late because my nephew and his wife, came from Belgium.
They came without warning, apparently a problem of money. Did you see?
I'm telling you all, as if we were in a date..
A lovers date?
Mmm.. looks good that sandwich!
- Would you like some?
- No thanks, I just eat.
Men aren't often seen this time of the day coming to the park.
- Do not have a job?
- Yes, I have several.
I pressed the pause button.
- I thought about you last night.
- About me? What?
About you and our pigeons.
You know, when we rearrange our books
We always start browsing a couple, at random.
I found a sentence.
Well, I forgot.
I'll find it.
"Can you imagine, for example, a town without pigeons no trees or gardens, where you never hear the thrashing of wings or the crunch of leaves, a nothing to tell us everything? "
"The change of seasons just seen in the sky the arrival of spring only known by its air or the baskets of flowers brought in from the suburbs by peddlers"
"A Spring sold in markets. "
- Yes, could you start it again but slowly this time, please?
Gladly, I apologize.
"Can you imagine, for example, a town without pigeons no trees or gardens...?"
It can't be.
But it's not bad.
- What is the title?
- "The Plague."
- By Albert Camus.
- Albert?
As my grandfather.
- I can lend it to you, if you want. - No, no.
You know, the reading for me is...
"We were 500 when we left, but thanks to the reinforcements, were 3000 thousand when arrivings in Porto. "
"Upon arrivings in Porto."
Very good.
Even when he reads, Mr. Chazes makes spelling mistakes.
- Would you read another piece?
- Yes, I would.
Suits me fine, I like to read aloud.
But if people see me sitting sputtering on a bench alone, - May take me as a ... - An old crazy, for sure.
One crazy.
Crazy coming from whistling, hissing, Right?
In a hurry?
No, it's alright.
Well, we start then?
Let's skip the first page to get into action.
The story takes place in Oran in Algeria.
- Have you read it? - No, no.
But I know that Oran is Algeria.
I have another friend, Yusef, and his parents live there. - Oran.
- Yeah, well, let's begin.
"From day 18, factories and warehouses spewed hundreds of dead rats. "
"There were cases in which it was necessary slay the animals whose agony stretched. "
"Wherever our fellow citizens met, Rats are piled in garbage cans or long lineups in the sewers. "
No, I imagine.
Go on, go on.
"In the following days the situation worsened. "
"The number of rodents grew and the collecting became more abundant every morning."
"From the fourth day, rats began to leave and die in groups."
"They came out of dens, basements, cellars, sewers. "
"Surfacing hesitant in long lines to come staggering into the light, flipping on their backs and then die next to people. "
It is well written, right?
Yes, I feel grabbed by the ears, helpless like a rabbit.
Those rats swollen, smelly, screaming,
As if I could see them.
Totally disgusting.
Didn't you read anything by Camus?
"The Stranger", "The Fall"?
No, I don't think so.
Well, should we go on?
Yes, but another day.
I brought you fruit.
Did you whipe your feet?
How many did you smoke today?
350 and go to hell.
- Why Uncle Georges?
- I'm sick of his face.
- But it's family.
- All assholes.
- Here is your mail.
- It's my pension.
Do you want to steal my pension?
Give it to me!
Look what I did because of you!
You asshole!
Come, sit down.
Let's see what would look good, not blue...
I got it.
With the Spanish accent, of a flamenco dancer ...
- Do you like dancing?
- I love it.
True, looks great on you.
And making compliments is not my style.
Anyway, I can not afford it.
You'll pay for.
- In temperament. - Stop that.
- You must collect the rent.
- What?
For where my caravan is.
We'll fix that.
I can also cook for you, Mr. Gardini.
Jean-Michel.
Why do you stick your nose in here?
Go get my order at the Supermarket and stop looking at me like an idiot.
I have had enough.
Wanna get one?
"On hearing the screams of joy arising from the city Rieux remembered that this joy was still threatened
Because he knew what the ecstatic crowd wasn't aware of, and that can be read in the books. "
"And that perhaps the day would come when, for the misfortune and education of men the plague will wake up the rats and send them to die in a happy city."
There.
- Is it over?
- Yes
We had read "The Plague" in ten days except a few passages.
- You have read it.
- No, don't say that, Germain.
You are an excellent reader.
- Reading is also listening. - Listening?
Yes, look at the children.
To teach them, we read aloud.
If we read well, if they listen well, they ask for more.
And then, they need it, too.
And become addicted, as with a drug.
I have never taken drugs, nor books.
- here, I give it to you.
- No, no.
But this time, keep it.
Yes, I insist.
In this World we're just passing things
I'm passing this book to you.
I have underlined with a pencil all the parts we have chosen, and read.
- Thank you.
- I won't say "it's nothing" because it is not "nothing".
If you want, I will show you texts I particularly liked.
Will you?
With those gentle eyes of yours, you must have made many men do what you want by saying "Will you?"
Well, goodbye, Germain.
Goodbye, Marguerite.
"Plague".
Let's see ...
"The next day,
April 17 ... "
The shock was terrible in the South.
The buildings have collapsed, there are 32 dead and hundreds injured.
Hell, there are those who have no luck.
If they don't drop bombs from the sky, the earth moves under your feet.
Then there are times when cholera hits.
Or the plague, as in Oran on the book by Camus.
- Have you read Camus?
- Not everything. "Plague," "The Fall" "The Stranger."
Since when you're intersted in books?
- What happens to Francine?
- Yusef's gone.
- Go where?
- No, with whom.
With Stephanie, the nurse.
I had no idea, I thought ...
Nobody noticed, but that's it.
Don't give me that look.
Poor thing.
Well, cry or play?
Do not cry, honey.
Yusef will come back, you'll see.
- Come on, Francine, how old are you?
-50.
- What?
- I'm 50.
- Well, what do you want...
- What do you mean "what do you want."?
I didn't imagine there was much difference in age.
Yusef knows that an old pot makes better soup.
I'll just say two words. Bra-vo.
It's normal, I'm trying to help.
Besides, is not the only Yusef
It's like Dr. Pélisson's car
Of course you know, come here.
He was just about to scrapp it, but on the end, found a buyer.
- Yes. - You are inspired. Must be well read.
- I'm going, I have things to do.
- And books to read.
No rush, do not rush to return.
What a jerk!
What a jerk.
Those idiots
Maybe they find it funny, but reading is difficult.
I'm telling you because you make fun of me.
Look, read a word, you understand, the second and third. Still, marking the line with your finger.
Eight, eleven, twelve, and so on, all the way to the period.
But that doesn't help.
The problem is that as much as you try to put them together, the words are loose.
They look like a bunch of bolts and nuts in a box.
Do you understand?
For those who know, it's very easy.
Look at Marguerite.
You should see the grandmother.
Forty kilos, wrinkled like a dry prune.
With thousands of shelves inside her head, and on those shelves books and more books.
- She understands everything.
- Hello.
- What? - Your vegetables are so beautiful.
You should do only that in your life, gardening.
I wanted to be a stained glass maker
Stained glass maker!
- It doen't even exist such word.
- Yes, it does.
- Want one?
- Quiet, Jacqueline.
- Where did you see a stain glass?
- In the church, by the window.
It is beautiful.
You can work as an apprentice at Pyrex, I know an accountant there.
Not bowls, I want to make stain glass.
Making stain glass is not an job.
You find it disgusting?
- Do not touch him, he's my kid.
- Shut up.
I finished, it's disgusting.
What did you say?
Apologize now.
What? Apologies?
Want another?
Where are you going with this, put it in your manure?
I do not put in manure, I take the manure out, get out!
You're blocking my view, move.
I told you to go away. Now!
Son of a bitch, you're crazy!
Out!
I'll count to three.
- One!
- If I leave, you'll never see me!
- Two!
- Okay, Jacqueline, sorry.
- Three!
- Damn, you're crazy!
Bitch.
Fucking bitch.
You'll regret it!
You're crazy!
You'll hear from me, and it won't be good news!
You'll see!
Hi, Jackie.
- Hey, son.
- Mr. Mayor, how are you?
- Don't you pick up the phone?
- It's been disconnected.
A Gardini called about a caravan that you are keeping here.
- He wants it back.
- Let him come, the door is open.
I was told that he lives here.
Lived.
- What did he do, that man?
- He hit my kid. And me.
- Do you want to report him?
- I can manage alone.
- You aren't threatening me, right?
- Me?
No.
I was just asking.
Bye, Jackie.
- Goodbye, Mr. Mayor.
- By the way, do you have a fork?
No, I have nothing like that.
- How long have we known each other?
- Long.
- Don't do anything stupid.
- No.
- And the fertilizer?
- What about fertilizer?
Ferilizer, fertilizer.
Manure, compost ...
You can stuff your soil with all that.
If bad, it'll remain bad.
At best, it'll give 4 or 5 potatoes the size of a marble.
But if you have a black ground, thick, lumps, that sticks, it will give you everything within.
You won't need fertilizer.
What's the matter?
You're special, Germain.
Thank you for all these wonderful veggies, but how do I bring them home? I will need a wheelbarrow.
- It will take them, where do you live?
- Aux Peupliers.
The residence at the town's end.
An old friend of my mother lived there.
She spent the day playing Scrabble and chewing letters, until she swallowed a "Z" and died.
No, excuse me, Germain, no ...
It is very sad.
Poor friend of you mother.
An unfortunate accident.
The truth is that I am very well in that residence.
There is good atmosphere.
The staff is very attentive.
You see, aging is cumbersome to others.
But age has an advantage if you get bored, it doesn't last too long.
There is a phrase that got stuck inside my head, it's of the novel we just started.
He says: "Howling like a dog on the grave of his mother."
Are you sure of that phrase?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
"Howling like a dog on the grave of his mother. "
- Yes, here it is, you're right.
- Yes?
"We always come back at the grave of our mother to howl like a stray dog. "
- That's it.
- Germain, I'm impressed.
You have an excellent auditory memory.
No, not at all. I just remember what I hear.
"It isn't good to be loved so much so young, so soon. "
- "It may create bad habits"
- What about me?
- I would like to hear, too.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
"It isn't good to be loved so much so young, so soon. "
- "It may create bad habits"
"We look, we hope, we wait."
"With a mother's love, life makes at dawn a promise it'll never keep."
This is the title.
The title, "The Promise of Dawn."
At first, life makes promises that does not keep.
That's exactly it!
There is the maternal love, and then ...
"Every time a woman embraces you and holds you tight against her chest, those aren't more than condolences. "
"We always come back to mother's grave to howl like an abandoned dog. "
"Never again, never again, never again never again adoring arms will hold you or sweet lips will talk to you about love."
Well, that's according to the author, Romain Gary, who was passionate about his mother.
Why?
This wasn't a made up story?
No, no, is the story of his life.
What if it were the other way?
- The other way?
- Yes
If not loved by his mother, what would have happened?
If someone didn't receive enough love as child, everything is left to be discovered, No?
I have no idea.
I do not know.
- Do you still have your mother, Germain?
- Oh, yes.
How was she with you, as child?
She did not care.
And now?
Same thing.
She doesn't care about me.
I'm nobody.
What you say is terrible.
The indifference is the worst thing, especially in a mother.
Jojo says it, no maternal instinct.
Never had it.
I was a mistake, an accident of July 14.
A firecracker.
- What is your name?
- Jackie.
Jackie.
Away with the leeks!
Leeks!
Leeks!
- Leeks!
- What are you doing?
- Hey, what do you do?
- Leeks!
Go back to your house!
- What have you done?
- No, no.
- What the leeks have done to you?
- Nothing, nothing.
I begin to worry.
This morning she pulled all the leeks out.
- The other day, she wanted to paint the cat.
- Depends on the color.
Hey, don't start me.
- You changed your hair style?
Looking good. - No, I've changed nothing.
- What if you put it in a home?
- Who? It will not be Francine.
- Your mother. - What?
She certainly won't go.
- Try it and you'll end up with a fork stuck in your belly.
Okay, okay.
His mother is his mother, in life there is only one mother.
- Just what I needed, having multiple.
- Stop it, she's not that bad.
She just lost her mind a little.
Like a fish, rotting starts with the head.
Hey, you speak of my mother.
- Have a little respect!
- I joked.
At this age, yet I must put up with all your bullshit.
- Thank you, Francine.
- Very nice.
I like when you wait for me at the stop.
- Do you like meatballs?
- You should know by now
- I like everything about you.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Careful. - Yes.
- Are you staying tonight?
- Sure, why not?
Make me a boy tonight?
Many even.
No, I'm serious.
What would you do with a father like me?
I did not finish primary school, I can not put three words together.
I am zero.
What could I give to a child?
Love
How is Francine?
What do you think?
- She's angry.
- Damn ...
True, Stephanie is young, but she's trouble.
Well, Francine also, but it's safer.
- What would you in my place?
- I'm not in your place.
Just being in my place is hard
In any case, I can say this:
you end up howling at the grave of your mother like a stray dog.
Well said, you're absolutely right.
- You went to play golf?
- No.
- Please. - It's for you.
- Is it for me?
- Wait
- What is it?
- Please.
Open it.
- A dictionary.
- As you can see, it is not new.
- I've used it a lot. - Yes
- It became useless, you know everything.
But I'm not at the age to travel. Traveling with a dictionary word by word.
We get lost in a maze.
We stop, we dream.
- You like it?
- Very much so.
But Germain
I think we have not read anything since "The promise of dawn."
- It's true.
- What would you like to read next?
I don't know How about an adventure novel?
A police story?
Well ...
Yes, the Amazonian Indians.
Yes?
And why is that?
As a child I had a comics book where I saw how they live.
What a good life.
They walk around naked with a case to cover their ...
Yes, their sex. That's it.
They do nothing. They play the flute, drink, they smoke pot They look at topless girls with a feather to cover their ...
I think I have another thing in my library. A novel.
Yes, a novel, but you must come to my house.
Well, my home ...
I do not want to bother you.
Bother?
Of course not.
Come Tuesday, for a tea.
- Tea?
- Yes
Okay for a tea.
You have to know how to write the word Eh, Jeremy?
Let's see, "labyrinth".
L-A. ..
Labyrinth ...
"Labyrinth ..."
L-A-B ...
Y-R-I ...
With one, or two R?
What do you think?
How do you write?
You don't even know.
Well, see, people's names.
Marguerite.
Marguerite.
With one L.
"Flower name" How easy!
Thanks for the info, Right?
Let's see, Annette.
"Anete."
"Anete."
Anete.
Wow, it's written differently.
It means "fennel".
What, good to see, "Germain".
Where is Germain?
G-E-R ...
I have it, Germain, "One, cousin, etc., "good.
"Two, a resident of Germany, Germans,
Burgundians
Franks, Goths,
Lombard
Saxons, Teutons, Vandals. "
Yes, dear, vandals.
Look, we are not alone.
You see, Jeremy.
Let's see "tomato" and then go to bed.
Tomato, tomato.
Tomato, tomato, see, Where is it?
"Solanaceae".
"Solanaceae, see olivette tomato or pear. "
Do not have more variety the tomato pear?
And the marmande?
And the San Pedro, Patanegra? To say a few.
What, it's not the season?
Let see Solanum, Solanum ...
"Family dicoti plants ..."
"Dicolte ... dicoltilo ... decoltedi ... "
Fuck! It sucks! I can't believe it!
You're right, that's Chinese, not for us.
Missing a lot of words, and words meaning nothing ...
It's not for us.
I'm returning it to Marguerite.
Here are your clothes.
See you tonight.
What did you say?
What?
Ah, the shirts.
What a shitty weather, and all these taxes.
That's equality, rain for all.
- Who are the flowers for? - Don't worry, not for you.
Let's see.
-4, 5 and 6.
- Heck, if has been fixed.
And this shirt, is it from Tutti Frutti?
- Go for a walk, okay?
Have you seen the hall?
They covered it all with graffiti.
- Assholes.
- Who did it?
The little morons, as always.
Newly painted!
What do you drink?
A strawberry soda.
- Those vandals.
- Vandals, Teutons, Lombards.
- Thugs.
- Yes, Lombards.
As you'd say Burgundians, Franks, Goths.
- What else?
- I don't know...
Saxons,
Swabians, Teutons, Vandals.
- I'm getting fed up.
- Where did you get all this?
You have a simmering knowledge.
- And this? A dictionary?
- Touch that and I'll kill you!
- But what is it?
- Well, do not start.
I do not want to see you here, fighting!
- Ciao, Yus, how are you?
- Hello, Germain.
Ah, Yusef.
Bravo, Yusef, I do need bread, but not wet.
Quick, dry yourself.
Come on, smile.
Hey, he's back?
You see, he's a two-timer!
- That's why the hair and...
- Sure.
You see, Francine? As I was telling you...
Cooking is better ...
What is it?
You went bananas?
Lost your mind, go see a shrink!
- As I said ...
- No, don't say anything.
- Don't talk.
- Tha's a good one, now I can not speak.
Okay, your turn.
THE RESIDENCE LES PEUPLIERS
- Good afternoon.
- Hello. I came to see Marguerite.
Marguerite... who?
We have several.
- Marguerite with two tees.
- Mrs. Van de Veld.
- Is she expecting you?
- Yes, for tea.
First floor, down the hall.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Germain.
- From my garden.
- Oh, thank you. From your garden, even.
Come in.
Walking with the dictionary?
No, I'm returning it
No use, not for me.
Not useful?
Yes, as I don't know how to spell many words, I don't find them.
And when I find them, I don't agree.
For example, in my field Tomato varieties, they only wrote one, pear tomatoes.
The other don't grow in the dictionary.
I agree, Germain.
It is very incomplete, I searched "crabs."
- And I'm still looking, it's not listed.
- See?
I didn't even offer you to sit, No, no, not there!
- There ...
- Yes, but it's too late for me.
Clear cutting the Amazon rainforest to make dictionaries, what a waste!
They are useless.
Idiots!
No, it's like giving glasses to a shortsighted person.
Suddenly, he sees too much, all defects the holes in himself.
With you I tried to learn, but it hurts.
It was better before, all fuzzy, simple.
I'll make the tea.
It also hurts me to hear you talking like that.
It's it you there?
- In the photo.
- Yes How about that!
You weren't much heavier than now.
Where is the camping?
In Zaire. Well, the Congo, if you like.
I was sent there in a medical mission, with W.H.O.
What is W.H.O.?
W.H.O. is the World Health Organization.
Wait, pass me that.
Let me help.
So, you were a famous Scientist.
Let's say a science person, that's enough.
May I serve you?
Thanks, not too much.
- You're doing well here, it seems.
- Yes But it's very expensive.
My nephew helps me, but for how long?
His wife doesn't like it.
So, we give up?
Give up hat?
The Indians of the Amazon.
I found this novel by Sepulveda.
It is a Chilean writer.
It is the story of indigenous people in a distant country being accused of killing a white hunter.
In fact, the culprit was a beautiful panther.
Then, that's it.
Let the Indians return to their jungle.
Wait.
What is the title?
"The Old Man Who Read Love Stories."
"Stunned, he got up holding the machete with both hands and waited for the final combat. "
"The female moved her tail frantically. "
"her small ears vibrated capturing all the noises in that jungle but she did not attack. "
"Surprised, the old man moved slowly to reach his gun. "
"Why don't you attack?"
"What kind of game is this?"
"Cocking the gun, he pointed."
"At such short distance he couldn't miss."
And then?
Next time, Germain.
You're tired.
Well, actually, after today
I don't think I'll be able to continue reading to you much longer.
Why?
Because I don't see very well.
I suffer from macular degeneration due to age.
I have spots in the center of the eye.
And these spots increase.
I can hardly read.
- This is why the magnifying glass.
Soon, my dear Germain will disappear in shadows.
I can no longer count the pigeons.
Can't you have an operation?
My sight is dying, it cannot be operated at death.
Soon I'll need a cane for avoiding obstacles on the street.
Wait.
I'll take care of the cane.
Who were the flowers for?
This morning, seeing the bouquet, I thought they were for me.
I've waited all day.
Hoping to see you at each stop.
Why would I bring you flowers?
Yes... why.
Who were they for?
I'm not Francine!
You behave like Yusef!
Do you love her?
What is her name?
Marguerite with two tees, the flowers were for her, this too.
And she's also 95 years old, and yes, I love her. Satisfied?
You're mad.
Come sit.
Sit.
Why didn't you tell me?
How, in what order?
An elderly woman who counts pigeons a dictionary where your name is "fennel"
a city infested with rats...
Who would believe me?
I believe you.
If you saw her...
Those fragile legs.
A crystal figurine, like those sold in stationery shops.
like a deer in the window...
I could break it just like that.
But now... she'll see the film in black and gray, and soon, in black and black.
Does it seem fair?
- She's getting blind?
- Yes, blind.
What can I do?
Spray windshield washer to clear her view?
Don't get angry, Germain.
I'm not angry, but what will she do, if losing her sight?
What about all her books?
Reading is like breathing for her.
When you stop breathing, what do you do?
You read to her.
- What?
- If she can not read, you do it for her.
I'll never be able to.
You must try.
Let me see.
Her cane.
It's beautiful..
May I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for a book.
You came to the right place.
Do you know the title, or author?
No, a book, you know.
Essay, documentary, fiction?
Well, I don't know a book that tells a story.
- A book.
- What kind? Short.
- A novel?
- Yes, a novel would be nice.
Not too big, and easy to read.
A novel... not too big and easy to read.
"How was formed this floating street?"
It makes no sense, but let's do it.
- "What ...?" marine
- Mariners.
Yes.
"What sailors aided by architects, had built in the middle of Atlantic on its surface, above a grave 6,000 meters deep? "
Damn, that's deep.
-6000 meters is 6 Km.
- Thank you.
So the Atlantic is very deep, not just big.
"A long street slate roofs, several modest shops and immutable. "
Shit, it starts already and I have no dictionary.
- Immutable ...
- Means that do not move.
Like you when we don't agree, you are immutable.
Immutable.
"How was that staying in one piece without even swinging ... "
Swinging?
Sure, the waves.
The waves did not wobble.
"The girl believed to be the only one in the world. "
"did she know at least she was a child? "
- What don't you understand?
- No, it's that I...
I think of that little girl lost in the middle of nowhere and Marguerite, a tiny sparrow.
"As if she lived, loved, always found about to die. "
"A human being infinitely disinherited in this
Aquatic loneliness "
Faster, again.
"As if she lived, loved, always found about to die. "
"An infinitely disinherited ... "
Louder
- Like when we make love?
- What? - You say "Faster, Harder".
- Stop it, Germain.
- What's wrong?
- I like making love, but not to speak of it.
Continue.
The beautiful Cadiz has velvet eyes ...
What are you doing?
You're crazy, give it to me!
Give it to me, give me the hose!
- Why are you watering?
- Do not touch me!
Let me go, let me go!
I'm calling the police!
- No, come on, get in house.
- Help!
- Get inside!
- Help, help! - Go up.
- I'm your mother, dammit!
- Go upstairs, Mom.
- Leave me alone!
- Go up. - You're hurting me!
Enough, up, watch your head.
You're hurting me, asshole!
I'm tired, I get tired.
- I get tired.
Lie down.
I'm tired.
I'll make coffee.
Now, I'll tell you who your father was.
Luis Mariano!
I used a soldering iron.
This is why you see black around the eyes.
Then I polished it with sandpaper, After with a chamois and then I painted it.
Well, what do you think, is it nice?
I'm not detesting it, Germain.
It's a litotes.
Like "You are ugly" when actually you mean to say "You are beautiful"
That's a litotes.
I'm not detesting it it means "I love it."
I love it, Germain.
Do not open your eyes, I have another little surprise.
- Why, what is it?
- Eyes closed.
Here, "What sailors...'
"What sailors with the help of architects, had built in the middle of Atlantic on its surface, above a grave 6,000 meters deep? "
- It's called "The Girl In High Seas."
- By Jules Supervielle, go on.
"A long street slate roofs, modest shops, immutable.. "
"How was that staying in one piece without even swinging ... "
Like it? Very much.
- Should I continue?
- Please, do.. Close your eyes.
"The girl believed to be the only one in the world. "
"did she know at least she was a child? "
Wow, "Save the World"!
Now, that you've saved the world Pay us a round.
- Gentlemen. - Listen to him.
You won't give us a chance?
I have no time.
No time to chat and play with friends?
What is going on, Germain?
You stopped drinking, use words we don't understand
You leave us, what's happening?
True, you've changed We liked you better before.
He's going to stop fucking, too.
Poor Annette.
I don't fuck with Annette anymore, you're right.
Now, we make love.
I know, 5 or 6 extra words.
Too bad. And if you don't like me that way, I don't give a shit.
And that's not a litotes.
Today's Special!
Fuck.
She left the lights on.
You could turn them off downstairs, at least.
Mom.
- Maitre, it's Mr. Chazes.
- Oops, I forgot.
I was expecting you, good morning.
My sincere condolences, Please, sit down.
Well, let's see.
With no other heir your mother's house is now yours.
- In addition to the amount of ...
- The house? Yes, her house.
But, she was s tenant.
She was. Over the years, she purchased it from Mr. Blondeau.
She saved every penny.
She did overtime at the factory days, nights
And she did well because, suddenly, six years ago, the old Blondeau died.
It was for you all this.
She never told you?
She also left you a box.
I haven't even opened it.
GERMAIN DESPUIS AND I , JULY 14
Your father?
They are my parents.
- What's this?
- Well... This plastic.
I told you I had not opened it, but when I saw it, I ... As she said, it's a piece of... of your umbilical cord.
Do you realize?
Not a look, a word.
Never.
And for years was devoted to saving money for me just for me.
- Can you believe it?
- I think so.
What will I do with all this?
- Except for the photo.
- May I see the photo?
They were very young and good looking.
How long were they lovers?
Long.
Long time.
At least five minutes.
I am pregnant, Germain.
I am pregnant.
Easy, easy.
Careful.
- Stop, stop.
- What happened? I have to tell Margueritte.
Here, the box.
See you tonight.
She's gone.
- What do you mean gone?
- Her nephew came, with his wife..
- But why they took her?
-They couldn't afford it anymore.
- When did this happen?
- This morning.
- Without warning? - We were warned, but not her.
- She's not coming back?
- I don't think so.
They've taken everything in a pickup Grandma, furniture, books.
- Do they live far?
- In the middle of nowhere.
- Where is that?
- Northeast of Belgium, almost Holland.
We do have the address.
Did not live a note, something?
- She left this for you.
- Ah, thank you.
Princess.
Caramelo, Pedrito.
Bow, Thief.
Cripple.
Plump, you're back.
Marguerite.
Hello, I came to see Marguerite.
Hello, Margueritte doesn't live here.
- You're the nephew? - Yes, but she does't live here.
- Where is she?
- Who are you? - I'm Germain Chazes, her friend.
- Yes
You know, we supported her as we could, but could not continue keeping her.
- We are not millionaires.
- Where is she?
Dear, do you have the address?
Wait, she'll get it.
Ms. Van de Veld.
- No, Van de Veld. - Wait.
Do you think we can go now?
I's OK?
- What a great surprise.
- Ah, you have wheels. - Can you go through?
- It has wheels, come on.
Did not realize, Germain?
This is kidnapping. Without completing the forms.
Without authorization from my family.
No exit visa.
- Embroglio! - "Embroguglio"?
By the time I find it in the dictionary, we'll be home, already.
At home, what home?
I have no home. Sure, in my house.
Ah, Germain.
Those sandwiches, still looking so good.
- Will you?
- Yes, yes, this time I wsnt..
- Thanks.
- Please.
- Bon Appetit - Thank you.
A rare find, between love and tenderness,
She had no other address
She was named after a flower and lived among words.
Adjectives pulled by their hair verbs that grew like weeds, some entering by force
He entered softly, from my skin to my heart.
In love stories there is't always just love.
Sometimes there is't a single "I love you" Yet, we do love.
A rare find.
I met her by chance in the park.
She did not take much space the size of a pigeon with its feathers.
Wrapped in words in names, like mine.
He gave me a book, and another pages that exploded in front of my eyes.
Do not go right now, it's not the time, wait.
It is not the time, little flower.
Give me some more of yourself.
Give me some more of your life.
Wait.
In love stories, there isn't just love.
Sometimes there is not a single "I love you"
Yet, we do love.each other.
... in Germany, however, called it as from now on Adolf Hitler.
Here we see him before the seizure of power by - former chancellor Franz von Papen and flying ace Hermann Goering.
That Hitler is a insult.
- A declaration of war.
- Yes.
- Am I disturbing you?
- Good day, Maja.
- Torgny has declared war.
- Against Us?
No, this time we are on the same page - all three.
I long to hear?
"That Hitler is an insult."
"It is an insult against all reason "... "Foisting upon a great nation a ruler of this caliber. "
"There is one thing that does not concern only Germans. " "Germany is no separate small island in the ocean. " "It is in the middle of Europe."
"Forcing the world to occupy themselves with the figure "... "Is inexcusable.
Herr Hitler is an insult. "
Pirjo, all the glasses until set?
Yes, there are three glasses at each place setting, ma'am.
It's wineglass. White wine, red wine, Madeira.
- Madeira or port wine.
- But make room for teacup.
- Who has succumbed?
- His wife, Hilda and me.
- Yes.
- Hilda?
- Where is Hilda?
- In the kitchen, I think.
Hilda!
- Rank The cards then? Are they right?
Where is the Countess Hamilton.
Mr. Mannheimer.
No no no.
Mrs. Forssman!
How she ended up at the professor?
- I thought...
- Where should the Countess Hamilton sit.
- The wife cried...?
- What?
No...
Yes, yes, yes, the glasses.
Water glasses. Download them.
It's like something has happened with the table setting.
My husband gets so angry.
Oh god!
Oh no.
Sorry, sorry.
- What do I do?
- We sweep it up, ma'am.
The rich are not really wise.
She was sick with grief. Her oldest son died when he was 13 years old.
Tetanus.
- You seem up today.
- It's Spring, Puste.
- Do you think it'll be fun? - What then?
The feast.
- I'm a little tired.
- But go to bed then.
Sleeping is not a sin.
There ought to know. You almost never sleeps.
But the truth To tell the truth Nothing but the truth.
There are moments in one's life, and I have known some like that... when the truth can be experienced as unbearable.
Something to human account can not get over his lips.
When I talk more about the personal, the private.
But if we do not speak opening hours if the crimes now committed in Germany under Nazism We are not just lie hostage, without its proponents... and commit not only treason... without subjecting each one honest and woman in the arms of the oppressors.
Maybe it is too big words at a festive occasion like this.
There are certainly those who in his own mind says... that looks like that is not the truth departure that it is all something distant and transient that does not concern us.
But the truth is that if one eats with the devil... it is good to have a long spoon.
Suffice it to him, however just an inch of little finger... then he takes the whole arm and shoulder... chest and face, wig and soul with.
And at that point is the devil Synonymous with Adolf Hitler for he too is man-eaters.
But, go friends, are you so afraid not. This will be the duck.
Bon app? tit.
- Cheers. - Cheers.
In the paper, we take a different view.
It is not the question about money and politics.
There is the issue of morality.
- Trade magazine for Hitler?
- Right.
Germans knoweth the only they can boost its economy.
But the war will be.
Torgny, one of my German friends has asked me to search have... somebody big Swedish newspaper writing something about the Jew baiting in Germany.
Yes...?
We have excellent decent Jews in Sweden.
That is not the case in Germany. But if the Jews were exterminated thereby would the country lose a significant portion of its goodwill.
Then did not get the foreign creditors the owners paid something of their claims.
Yes, thank God, I am not related with one of them... District Judge Wallenberg. The Germans, I mean.
For there is nothing wrong on my profile. I know right?
- No, not really.
- Or?
Mrs. Segerstedt sitting so alone.
No, I just take back a little bit.
It is a great idea to play in.
Yes. My husband is so fond in social life. He is...
He's so outgoing.
We who switched roles with time, my husband and I.
But you were a well-supported actress once?
Well.
- But now I'm just widow.
- Oh sorry.
Sorry, I think I do not.
It must have been terrible for you.
Well.
Can we not say you?
Puste.
Anita.
Anita.
All admire your husband.
All?
My sister in law meant it.
She if anyone knows well.
Who is it?
It's my mother.
I was eight years old when she died.
Maja?
Just like you.
What is it, Mom?
What does she have that I do not have?
A newspaper, Mom.
Mother?
You cried?
No.
I thought I heard something.
What did you want?
"The truth, nothing but the truth. "
It was a successful evening.
All thought well she was the hostess.
You could have exerted yourself a little.
- Singing and dancing perhaps?
- No, God bless me.
Good afternoon.
"Ich protestiere aufs Sch? rfste gegen die in ihre Zeitung "... "I protest in the strongest possible against the publication in your newspaper "...
"Before further action taken"... "I want to be notified"... "How your editorial in the future"...
"Before further action taken"?
From Hermann Goering, Reich Minister, morphine addict and murderer.
At first I thought it was a joke, but the text is verified by Hamburg.
No!
This should be framed and hung on the wall.
Tomorrow we quoted at all first... pages from DN to The Times.
- Cheers to you. - Cheers.
- Our proud knight.
- Missing only the horse.
Lance has he.
Touch? , mon ch? ri.
Goering, huh?
This necktie replace.
- No.
- Yes.
Are you going now?
- Mom. It is not true.
- I'm just saying what was said.
- And they will be our friends?
- They have the right to think as they please.
They said nothing bad about Jews.
Only in Berlin.
- As was the riffraff?
- No.
That they were not as cultured as those we have here at home.
That you can be so naive, mother, I do not understand.
Just take Maja Forssman. That's an educated woman?
And Jewish.
Yes, perhaps I am naive. But it was a good lunch. I'm happy for our friends.
- Are you happy for our friends, Torgny?
- Yes, dammit.
In addition, some believed he know Hermann Goering is delightful.
Charming.
- Remember that we are all gathered.
- I go tomorrow.
Ohh...! But I'll stay a while, Mom.
- Good day, Ida.
- Good day, the lawyer.
Really?
Are you here?
As you can see.
You're always welcome, dear friend.
No... work call.
See you later, Alex.
Our correspondent in Berlin have been sent home.
Goering.
Huh?
2-0 to us.
Yes, but it is hardly in our interest.
"Herr Hitler is a BLUSTERER." "An insult the bellowing of the crowds "... "Offenders, cavemen, murderers, arsonists, psychopaths. "
So far, I am with you. But you can not write that Goering sat on the Swedish mental hospitals.
This can have consequences.
Hope you have dry on your feet.
Galoshes, as always. You can be absolutely calm.
Shaft... Why do you not?
Why?
Can you give me a reason, Torgny, why Maja and I would be separated?
What do Puste?
That she believes I'll be back.
God knows I've done my best to get her second thoughts.
- And Maja...? - And Maja...
She says just like you: why?
There you go. The perfect marriage.
Speaking of which - Parliament House burning in the night in Berlin.
Thursday?
Did you say Thursday?
Well, then both of my men leave.
If you acquire precious jewelry you should wear them.
In the presence of them all?
Was it Torgny or you who insisted on it?
He has a moral vision of immorality.
Really? I have always understood you as open-minded, Anita.
Just because I danced in Scala Revue I do not need to be without morals.
And Shoulder?
I love Axel and Axel loves me.
May I serve the ladies more tea?
Thank you, dear.
No thanks.
I take what I want, Anita.
In this way, it was my brother and I quite similar.
When it did not go as he pleased it had to be.
Suicide, yes.
This spring's happy guests what a delight in the sun which s?
ngarfester lark... (Car honks)
The darkening of the world.
There comes a battle to the death.
For or against liberty and right.
For or against all the poets and the dreamer has given us.
For or against the belief in the eternal Human of the people.
Dear Per Albin.
It is alright that the country Prime Minister... sacrificed themselves and come political club.
We are certainly disagree on several points... but as a wise man has said:
disagreement makes strong.
A majority do well to often listen to the minority opinion.
In a democratic society achieves no income if you do not succeed solve the problems together.
Look at Germany.
For a man like Hitler comes a day then provocation throw away violence regime.
- Would you like your tea?
I thought you were coming.
Put the tray only.
What are you writing?
The usual.
- And it could not wait?
- No.
Come here, yes. You're cute.
Lie. Lie.
Yes, lie.
Sometimes I wish you were as you write, Torgny.
You look tired.
Drink your tea.
Sometimes I do not even that you think of me.
Two minutes, a quarter.
One afternoon while. Not even that you can sacrifice me.
Puste, that's not true. You know that.
I also know that nothing is as it was.
How in heaven's name would able to be there after all these years?
Abbe!
Our son would have been 27 years today.
- Now tiger you!
- We have been silent for 14 years, Torgny!
Yes!
Why not come to me?
Are you impotent?
- Impotent?
- Yes. Can you not?
Well, maybe I am. But maybe it's only with yourself.
Satan!
What the hell have you done? !
I burned your dog.
I blanched your stupid dog Brute!
17 years ago. And it took three persuasions... to get our Professor to realize their own best... and pack their bags and go west... to breathe new life in our hardened circuit and ditto newspaper.
That we bargain... got a breath of fresh air from our sister country western...
A breath from the Norwegian mountains
We can thank Torgny's good taste and review.
We have probably heard, Puste... how a pedestrian breathing life in the young... and oh-so-shy young theologian.
Let's make a toast. Cheers. For our guests of honor.
Puste and Torgny.
Welcome, my friends.
Ladies and gentlemen, Now there will be music!
Welcome.
"Spring" by Grieg.
Imagine if we could get hear... the beautiful Norwegian language sung also.
- Puste...
- No.
Would not you do us the favor?
Well!
Puste!
My thought's view
One you are becoming you are my hearts first love.
I love you no one her on earth
I love you.
I love you.
I love you. in time and eternity
I love you. in time and eternity.
Yes.
Music!
Maestro! Music!
You seem to have surprised many with your charming performance.
He says you're sick.
Yes.
I am sick.
- What ails you?
- Are you always so blunt?
I feel a certain responsibility.
There you have to explain to me.
You do not like my direct manner. I do not know anything else.
Then I can explain what ails me.
It's my husband made me.
Yes...
But then I guess I break our relationship.
Do you hear what you're saying?
You should be this and that you should Datten.
But if it is as you say has been well my husband a say in the matter as well?
We are in a common struggle.
Yes. You've era Hitler.
What do I have?
Mother?
Two women.
Can you have two women at the same time?
Three.
Nowadays, you are always with me, mother.
And now, you have it all?
Power, wealth, women?
Yes.
Your father.
You're just like your father.
You are deceiving yourself.
I thought it was the other thing I cheated.
It was too hard for you.
Maja.
Let be.
Have you ever read van de Velde "The consummate the marriage," Axel?
I think that was a strange question.
There do you think?
Why read about it When I live in it?
- Ha, ha!
- It was a strange reaction.
Is it even a marriage?
Or is it just my money you marry?
Now you're vulgar.
Mhm? And it is not Jewish upper class women?
So here we usually do not speak with each other.
No.
Then it was about time.
Can I have a cigarette?
Yes.
Thank you.
Should you have fire too?
I am concerned what bees everywhere fire.
Why are you so aggressive?
Without me you had never gotten him.
Good night, Axel Forssman.
Where are you going?
Away.
- Ugh, I'm freezing.
- But where are you, Mom?
To Norway. I have to go home.
My Home?
But when will you be back?
Yes, come. Yes, it was good.
How could you let her go, Dad?
- What if she does not come back.
- Why would not she?
Because of...
Because you do not care about her.
Ingrid, you do not understand.
What is this I do not understand?
That you treat her like air?
Everyone knows.
How did this happen, Dad?
Ever since we arrived in Gothenburg. You are not like you, Dad.
Once we were a family.
Do you not see what she has done?
Against the mother. Against you.
Against us.
And Abbe...!
Why did we not mourn him?
Never even mention him?
I do not understand. I do not understand how it got this way.
"If the woman has a good man"... "Seen it enough in her face."
"The wife is her husband"... "What man has made her."
"How long will you young?"
"As long as you are loved."
Yes.
When will she be back?
I do not know if she comes back.
Oh yes, she does.
So she can wait for you coming back. Do you?
(Dogs whine) - Do you?
- Come on.
Do you understand now why I never intend to leave?
I can not share yourself with your dogs.
It's dad's.
He wore it the first time we met. In Berlin in 1898.
Mothballs.
Remember, we went engaged in seven years before we could afford to get married.
Right, my beloved spouse?
Then could of course your little whirlwind calm down a little.
In addition, your taste in clothes had time to change his mind since.
Take it off.
It is you who are the future for you, Candidate Segerstedt.
The others have already fallen behind.
Good afternoon. Please sit down.
"If polytheism Genesis".
Allow me to congratulate dissertation, the candidate Segerstedt.
But I got a fail. It knows well the professor?
The enemy showed so clearly her face.
It should be thankful for. It is like the devil.
I do not believe in the devil.
But if you still see him you should see him right in the eye.
I think that...
I think I have lost faith.
There is much in my mind I am unhappy with.
- Maybe the evil just a metaphor.
- No, nonsense.
Evil is a fact. Evil is real.
But how do you recognize it?
Listen to the birds.
Is there anything more beautiful?
I love nature.
Then listen to the song blackbird and let doubt danger.
Nothing is more beautiful.
Damn!
Puste!
Pu...
Puste!
Puste?
You knew that my heart was weak. Not just for you.
Berlin in 1898.
Do you remember?
You thought I was awful. Not true?
The young theologian horrified of the light-footed Norwegian.
Yes, but it went over, is not it?
Well.
You should be thanking me. Because I have taught you.
I got you to read both Ibsen and Strindberg.
And not only Luther and the Fathers.
Thanks to you, I became an atheist.
Man dies from lack of love, Torgny.
I did not I did not love you. I was silent because I loved you.
You turned me into your care, I did not want.
So the whole thing is my fault?
Oh sure the hell is that.
Now you anyway min. I will not be acknowledged.
Say how are you with love today?
do you love me still?
However, Pirjo!
There's no water glass.
Not because I think they are needed.
Beer and schnapps.
Our Prime Minister is a man of the people.
Sometimes I wonder if our dear Professor wish he was.
"Memento mori".
Never forget that you are mortal.
Say how are you with love today?
the flame burns yet?
She should be understood have the Prime Minister to the table.
She believes she is the wife here in the house.
You do know that Per Albin has a mistress?
- He with.
- Oh my God.
Sorry.
Say how are you with love today?
she loves you yet?
Cheers! Cheers, dear Prime Minister.
You're a... a breakwater.
For both right and left.
Tell me how you have it with Hitler today?
Will there be war?
The is war, Mannheimer.
The association between the German-speaking countries, Germany and Austria - is now an accomplished fact.
German troops crossed the border in several places.
Here we see the artillery and cavalry at the border town of Kufstein.
The Hitler youth are greeting without rehearsal
And the old ones were not worse.
Swastika flags were apparently in stock and was widely in use.
I do not want more.
Daily News has Torgny on the front page today.
The entire speech is published.
- Shall I read to you? - Yes.
"The German Jews rush these days in large numbers against the country's borders "... "To possibly get over to other states. "
"There they are met by guards flat-folding bayonets. "
"We have a great responsibility"... "For what we say about it as is done in another country. " "But we also have a great responsibility for we do not say. "
"We still have a free press"... "And we need to understand and evaluate what it means. "
You once said that there were those who hoped I would die.
- Do you remember that?
- I have not said.
Joho.
Yes, I understand them.
But you can well understand I also hoped.
- In Professor Segerstedt.
- Heil Hitler.
- Vaasa?
- Heil Hitler!
Mr Hitler?
Then you've come to the wrong.
- I want to talk to Segerstedt!
- Segerstedt here.
Heil Hitler!
You'll die, your Jew lover.
You want to kill me?
Interesting.
Long live the Swedish National Socialism!
Hear ye, hear... We do so here.
Come home to me, we take a drink in peace. Then you can kill me.
Do we agree?
How well.
Then we'll see you here. Very kind of you.
Goodbye, goodbye.
You invite a killer on the grog?
Why not?
It would taste with a grog.
Huvva!
Pirjo, murderers enroll not by telephone. They come from behind when you least expect it.
In addition, we have our dogs. Not true?
Have you seen the way, Soren?
No.
S? ren!
S? ren!
Strychnine, I guess.
I think you should talk to the police.
And so should you think about what you eat now.
"With a bang committed Adolf Hitler's birthday. "
"Plate Slick were, lismarna" "And adventurers around cheering him. "
"In their tracks march to another group."
"It counts battalions the thousands and thousands. " "There are those who have been murdered in prison and concentration camps. "
"At the horizon looming even a bigger crowd. " "It counts millions."
"That's all that should let his life in war "...
Thank you, Ida. ... "That should let his life in the war that with each day gets closer. "
"The war that will crown Adolf Hitler's life's work. " "The approach is inevitable as fate."
"It is approaching fast as storm-driven storm clouds. "
Stockholm-Motala.
Prime Per Albin Hansson talking.
Citizens. It is appalling that we are in the final hopes... the world would be spared from occurred.
A new great war has broken out.
We have to note this unfortunate fact - and it serves good bit more - trying to express the sorrow and horror we feel.
For Swedes, it is now that with quiet determination - to gather around the big task - to keep our country out of the war.
To cherish and protect our inalienable national values.
What do you want?
Estrid Ancker, Professor's new secretary.
Come on in only.
- Sit. Do you have a pen and paper?
- Professor Segerstedt want...
Torgny. Here we are you with each other.
Idun. You were employed at Idun.
- As a fashion writer, I guess.
- Yes.
- From Sk? ne?
- Lund.
Why do you want to be with us? (Winston growls)
Quiet, Winston!
- Sorry. He's just a puppy.
You were right. It's terrible.
May I introduce Miss Estrid Ancker, my new secretary.
Maja Forssman.
You look rude spirited out.
"So the lightning broke up out of the cloud masses "- "and the thunder rolled out over the world. "
"Those who in the future tells about all this "- "should be able to tell you too how it went. "
"Most of us who now with excruciating tension sees "- "every drop of events quiver and fall "-
"should then sleep the eternal sleep in the womb of Mother Earth "- "as born such an accident burdened generations. "
"Gone are we, and the next generations are transferred '- "the heavy legacy to be human. "
"The cursed and blessing heritage. "
terminal. 16 is now an extra news release from the TT.
Finnish president has to maintain national defense - and maintain law issued a regulation - whereby Finland declared in a state of war.
Field Marshal Mannerheim is over - Commander of the Finnish troops.
As was mentioned this morning - has Russian troops exceeded the limit - and Russian aircraft have bombed among others. Helsinki, Vyborg and Enso.
(Iron seeps) Helsinki has been subjected for several air attacks.
"No one can ignore that Sweden's position "- "Influenced by the Russian assault in Finland. "
"Just dusty Registry souls believe"... "That no evil enters the huddling contract and quiet as a mouse "... "With frightened eyes looking on the nobles berserk. "
"There is a limit where"... "Observance of the diplomatic shadow-label "... "Feels humiliating."
I have written to him.
My first task here.
You were good friends Before you became a mirror fencers.
He hoped for a government post once upon a time.
Foreign Minister.
The frustration shines through in everything he writes.
Now it's you who is foreign minister. You may bring your old friend by the collar.
G? nther...
Traitors, Jew lackey...
Invektiven shifts.
And G? nther ask Segerstedt cease with writings.
The Germans have the impression that this country is inhabited by Mahan - against which they can go forward ad libitum.
"Our government writes little notes berlin the bins. " "And the State Board of Information overwhelms the Swedish press "- "With requests to remain silent with your and silent Datt. "
With great hesitation I sit here.
Segerstedt is my close friend.
But we are surrounded by breakers. And that applies to guide us through them.
Otherwise, we risk... that like Poland shared between Russia and Germany.
Or become "captured in patronage" of Germany.
Targeted interventions might be a possibility?
Targeted interventions?
"Is it better to live on your knees than to die upright? "
Ah, there you are beautiful.
Axel takes it up there.
(Trampling and loud voices) Now it is time again.
It is seized, I think.
Fucking press counselor!
And there sits the...
Freedom of the Press Ordinance of 1812!
Misunderstanding with a foreign power!
Holy shit!
It scares away advertisers.
Then compromised the paper's finances.
We can not ask our staff penniless!
If Torgny continues like this so he is ruining the newspaper.
Shaft?
Axel, calm down and take a brandy.
"As far as the tank and the power of language given to me "... "I have tried to draw the Swedes attention to the danger "... "As an intrusive agitation from a foreign power means. "
"Nothing proves better the need to make this endeavor has been "... "Than the experimental to silence Trade magazine. "
It looks damn nothing.
See nothing, hear nothing...
It is well so they want it.
It's blackout.
You come from G? nther, Per Albin and company?
No, from Sigge Larsson's Furniture.
Maybe we should come back later?
No no. But start inside the main editor room.
Where are the most dangerous light leak.
No. What happened?
So you still takes him seriously?
Yeah, I mean Segerstedt.
Yes, we have a psychopath to do.
I mean, Hitler, that is.
Is there anyone who believes To Segerstedt on your hand may drag us into war?
We do not need to worry about for him more.
I thought it was short we played.
King of Spades. It was the one you had needed.
How is it for? Are you steady enough on hand?
Yes, just you sitting still in the boat.
It'll surely more to the shake you up, I think.
But perhaps there are those in your vicinity that are not as careful course.
You've never shown the slightest sympathy of Nazism.
Do you intend to offend me?
No. Therefore, I have so difficult To understand this... caution.
I am a politician. Is not that explanation enough?
Let me get it bluntly.
I think that you put the country's security on game with your writings.
What a stray theologian writes in a provincial newspaper... can hardly set the world on fire?
- Is everything to their liking?
- No, it is not.
But it has not to do with you.
You know very well that in the case nazism... is to remain silent also to agree.
Cheers, my friend. What you say is true.
But there is something called "right words at the right time."
Sometimes you earn both the freedom that freedom of expression best... by shut up.
- You mean I should shut up?
- No, I do not mean.
- It's not that we bowls for?
- No. What is it?
I suggest only you put your words such that it does not lead Sweden in the war.
Cheers. Now I know what you mean.
Am I a traitor then, as some say?
No, but you run the risk of becoming so.
However, Pirjo, what gives?
Excuse me, professor. That's my brother.
- Yes?
- He is dead.
- Death?
- The Russians...
Well, poor, Pirjo.
What can I do for you?
- Excuse me, professor.
- You'll travel back to Finland.
Your mother needs you now. You get to travel so clear.
- And the return journey. You come back?
- Yes.
Good.
Good.
I mean - off.
"The Swedish Collection around neutrality "- "has nothing to do with heirloom and intricacy. "
"It is an expression of a free and independent people's will to live. "
"It's my confusion that through our actions. " "not only to be taken Swedish interests "- "but also created the best possibilities to assist Finland. "
I can understand if Segerstedt after all their precipitation against a foreign power sleep badly at night.
Yes, that's right. And the country's government will sleep well.
You call for consistency.
Is not compromise the consequence?
Is it a compromise Sweden want to achieve in this thing?
No.
- What is it?
- Nation requires a response.
And to answer is me. I and my government.
I am convinced that the majority of the Swedish people share our feelings.
Whose action for you, Torgny Segerstedt?
Freedom of speech and my conscience.
Is aid to Finland set?
- No.
- But Sweden does not send any troops.
No military support a brother country at war.
- Yes.
- You mean no.
- I mean what I say.
- Do you?
Here it is implied more than I care to listen to.
Inserting the Swedish troops in the Finnish fight... could perhaps prevent a breakdown in a few months.
And then?
Yes, since we have war with Russia. Which is in alliance with Germany.
Should Sweden fencing against both Russia and Germany?
No. No, the Swedish side becomes no question of military intervention.
- But the help we ship.
- Help?
! -8000 Husband.
- Voluntary, yes.
A country's misfortune is better than two countries.
If one can speak of good and evil.
We flees with his tail between his legs as we usually do.
You are similar to Sweden at a dog. Or is it me who is the dog?
As they say:
"Not fit galoshes you just have to take them off. "
Now I go from here. Here we no longer.
My news broadcast of TT.
Germany have launched military action against Norway and Denmark.
The German government has to Norwegian Government made the request - that Norway should be submitted to the German administration.
The Norwegian government declined this.
Good day, Ida.
Hope professor excuse the mess.
- Here you will be shelter in the basement. - Really?
The lawyer is in his room.
You realize that you are standing at the top of their list?
In this case you are number two, Axel.
And Maja.
One for all, all for one.
Here?
Or this?
Here.
My heart belongs to you after all.
But now it is German. I intend to shoot first.
Axel can not shoot a fly.
But you can not.
Dr. Mannheimer handing out pills to the needy.
- Should I ask for a to you?
All the talk that we ourselves can commit neutral actions- by allowing the march of belligerent troops - is grabbed out of the air.
We intend with all the mills standing agents meet each trial - to violate our neutrality.
You hurt Sweden's interests with your writings.
It can not be tolerated any longer.
Moreover, the country can not defend longer than ten days.
We do not want to wander in the woods while shooting for us... as they did with my relative Haakon of Norway.
I wish not something wars.
But a people can be exposed for worse strain. Losing their freedom.
You're blinded of your hatred against the Germans.
I do not hate the Germans. I hate the Nazis.
We do not understand the benefits you type as you do.
I do not think it helps to write against my conscience.
We know why you're helping Jews.
Moreover, we will tell you that in choosing between Germany / Russia... we prefer to become Germans front to be Russians.
With your majesty permission...
I prefer for my part remain Swedish.
The audience is over.
Thank you.
Remember that in case of war then it is your fault.
(Snort) - The judgment of the dead man...
- What?
Excuse me, uh, the judgment of the dead man.
Hávamál, Icelandic saga.
"Cattle die, kinsmen die, yourself you die too. "
"One thing I know that never dies:
The Last Sentence. "
Yes...
Can you compromise with evil?
Never. But there are different ways to fight on.
Transporting German troops through Sweden under official patronage?
Yes, possibly.
Fold all four legs in the weather for Hitler?
No Swedish folds on the back of Hitler.
Here I disagree with.
Think of our admirable Foreign Minister Mr G? nther.
At the slightest fart from Hitler he sings "Prepare the way of the Lord"... when he should hold my nose.
- Now you're being unfair.
- Hardly.
What on the surface may resemble an ugly control may actually conceal a wise tactic.
You dare not tighten the string. Finally, it is too lax.
Laxity is pitting for a people.
Every now and then you will be in a shrill voice.
I will then be provided with gagging?
No, the only thing you should not is to sure on behalf of others.
Torgny...
Have you ever thought about the battle you are fighting... maybe it's just your own and completely private?
- I heard you met the King.
- How did you do it?
You must excuse me, but I have an important meeting awaits.
- Good day, Christian.
- Torgny.
How are things?
What do you have and capital Now concocted?
You play the King and think I'll shut up.
How the hell could they make you Foreign Minister?
Their good opinion of course. Just like when disaffection with you.
- What do you want?
- That you leave my newspaper in peace.
Leaving your newspaper alone?
Do you hear how it sounds?
So that you get to play with fire for your amusement?
Is there any form of therapy you're doing?
Should the young theologian defeat... compensated by St. Torgny's duel with the dragon perhaps?
Prior to the devoted princess?
- I will not let you continue.
- Do you hear how that sounds?
Do not be so sure.
A few pen strokes and you end up in the biting wind.
Luckily there are no witnesses.
Threats against government member. It is... six months on bread and water. At least.
Without pen and paper.
I have the press agent assignment... to coat today's issue trade magazine in the attachment.
This.
Are you sure to release immediately stopped?
Ingenious.
Inaccessible.
Yes.
Germany and Soviet Russia - are then early this morning at war with each other.

In this moment proceeds a marching is - the greatest the world has ever known.
Animals were you anyway Never any problems.
They loved you.
Why did you go away so early, mother?
You do not decide everything myself.
But the that decided not you?
Losing someone is to be free.
Why did not you go to your father?
He was even further away. It was you I wanted. It was you I wanted.
Like all little boys.
No. As I.

So beautiful - your head skull.
So flawless.
Promise me you do not let cremate you.
(Maja sighs) He is so tired, our knight.
- Now turn it hopefully.
- Yes.
But do not let go yet, Torgny.
As if you ever have released something while.
As you probably have understood... it's almost time for the breakup here.
Breakup?
Yes, do not you might hoping once.
No, this is the big breakup that awaits us all.
And for me it's pancreas, pancreas.
Do not look so frightened.
Mannheimer thinks he can promise me a few more months.
Why, I... it's...
Listen now. You should be kind to Maja.
Sen. Well, you know what I mean.
She loves us. In their own way.
At least you, Torgny.
I... expect... that you are moving away from Maia.
Now it's almost over. The old year.
Is that really necessary?
Happy new year!
Cheers.
- Happy new year. Happy new year. - Happy new year, dear friend.
Yes, cheers for love!
- Shakespeare.
- Yes.
Are we to health?
Come on. Yes, you are so in love.
Maja?
Is this you?
No. It's not you anymore.
- Should I deduct?
- No, I can not stand the light.
What should I do?
Do you love me?
Now I draw from.
Come down to me in the dark, my love.
I think you should thank me that I have taught you.
Yes.
- Who would I do without you? - Mm.
It will be fine.
Disappears darkness then?
Yes.
When?
When dying darkness within you?
No one should be allowed to take me alive, Torgny. None.
Milk I had, but unfortunately no sugar.
You're cute as you are, Estrid.
My friends call me Trixie. Should dogs have a little?
No thanks. IT'S SO KIND OF YOU.
What a surprise to you came here.
Winston has peed on the floor.
- I'll dry up.
- No.
- Trixie, I do not know...
- What do not you know?
What I would do without you.
The wife is up there.
But she wants to be left alone.
Thank you.
I'll get Ida.
No, sit here with me.
Tell him that I did not want lie against him.
Do you realize that you turned a man for a monument?
Do you realize that?
Would you sing for me?
What should I sing?
The sun is so red, mother and the forest becomes so large Now the sun is dead mother and the day goes away Fox goes out there, mom we lock our time
come and sit by my pillow, mother and sing a little song
Mother?

Yes, it's me, Torgny.

Why is this night, Mother and cold and chilly wind?

God, here I sit and chatter. I'm meeting Shaft.
Farewell, Torgny. We'll see.
You know what Dr. Mannheimer said.
Suffice a stroke.
Why do you, Dad?
Because everything is so fucking boring.
You...
Why did you go to G? teborgsposten?
- Have you no shame?
- Are you going to say?
The press anyway what I write.
Come on, Dad. It's a new year soon.

"Call of darkness shadows away from every country. "
"Call him up, the white death."

Do you sleep well at night, Trixie?
- How so?
- No wolf hour or so?
It's happened.
But when the sun comes up so bursting trolls, no?
It's just that Now that does not crack trolls anymore.
How many articles I have on my conscience?
Ten Thousand?
Suffice probably not.
And at least as many enemies.
Two women's lives. Some dogs' affection.
The judgment of the dead man.
I'm tired of being enemy with so many people in the world.
We sit're all in the same boat.
But I would like to see Herr Hitler went overboard before me.
And when he is there, what is there left to fight?
Evil, Trixie.
The roots.
I am looking to buy a dog.
I can well understand. You've only got three. A Newfoundland.
They swim well.
As soon as it went.
I have written in the sand.
I know right?
What do you think?
Are you awake, Dad?

I love you, Torgny.
No no...
No no.
Hitler.
Hitler.
Is he dead?
Yes.
He is gone.
Is that her?
Yes.
She won't be even one second too early.
She's like that.
What is she like?
If she were six, you'd say she's sulky.
Is she alone here?
Her incarceration disintegrated her circle of friends.
Doctor Wolff will be working with us. She is from Berlin... from the Charité Hospital, and has decided...
We have introduced ourselves.
Good, we will continue with the ankle fracture.
The swelling has subsided entirely. We'll remove the drains.
Let's have a look at the leg.
It looks great.
You'll soon be playing football again.
You're midfield?
Centre?
On the right.
So this is the leg you shoot with.
Can you shoot with your left?
Not well. It's only to stop me falling over.
Your trainer told you that, right?
I'll have to speak to him
- Why?
Your opponent will know at once you have to move right to cross.
That's it.
You were brave.
You scared the little one by making that grimace.
He tensed up and it hurl him far more.
I'm sorry
Sorry, but he'll have known you were trying to distract him
In any case, he'll still be shooting with his right
Bon appetit.

That's Berlin.
- No kidding!
I can give you a ride.
I've often waited here. It can take ages.
Thanks.
Well, do you like it?
The work, the ward.
It's only my first day.
You shouldn't be so separate.
People here are sensitive:
Berlin, the Charité, the capital.
They quickly feel outclassed.
Is that why you said 'separate'?
So as not to sound second class?
You should have asked me at the crossroad.
This is the right road.
What should I have asked you?
Where I live.
But you already know.
And why I came to the provinces.
But you know that, too.
Don't act astonished.
They spoke to you.
You're groomed.
And here's where I separate.
Stop here, please!
Till tomorrow.
Hello, I'm Mrs. Bungert.
I have to show you the cellar.
Can it not wait till tomorrow?

Let her go!
They'll lei go of you now.
Stella... can you try to sit up.
Stella... can you do this?
Try it.
All right.
Damn it.
I'll be right back, things will be fine.
Meningitis?
From ticks?
Probably.
Did you find the marks?
She hid in the fields for six days.
In an area full of ticks. It's in the file.
I normally read them all. I just thought...
We'll have to do a lumbar puncture.
Curl up.
This will hurt terribly, but you'll be fine.
It's this girl's fourth stay and each time...
Stella.
- What?
The girl is called Stella.
Yes, Stella's been here four times, each time she was faking because she didn't want to work.
Can we talk about it tomorrow?
I have to go.
I can give you a ride.
I've got a bike.
See you tomorrow.
This shouldn't actually occur.
No.
Can't you read?
You'll be shown to your table.
Can I use the toilet?
- End of the corridor, on the left.
Excuse me, where are the toilets?
In the front.
Barbara?
Shit, the sodding boat's arriving.
Here, I have to go.
Say, aren't you a doctor?
Does putting your legs up in the air do any good?
Against varicose veins?
Yes, it's good.
- Is it really good?
Had a little outing?
It's a pretty area, particularly at night.
This way, please.
Morning.
I know, I'm late.
The serum has arrived.
Can I come in briefly?
Stella is refusing an intravenous drip unless you do it.
I can drive you over and bring you back to rest afterwards.
Fine. In five minutes.
They allocated you a horrible apartment. But there's a piano.
Shall we go?
Do you play?
It's out of tune.
- So you do play.
Does this often happen to you?
I was not to be found for several hours.
Where were you, then?
The young girl is pregnant. - what?
Stella is pregnant.
Did she tell you?
I noticed when making the serum.
You made the serum yourself?
It would have taken at least four days to get it from Restock.
You have a lab?
At the clinic?
- Yes.
The serum will act quickly.
You'll be able to read in two days. And look out the window.
He's got to go.
I'll be right back.
They'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me.
And they'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me...
They won't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass.
They'll soon get tired of that, and won't bother no more about me.
All right; I can stop anywhere I want to
If Stella really is pregnant, it's a catastrophe for her.
They'll take away her child.
She wants to keep it?
She doesn't know yet.
You didn't ask her!
Are you quite sure?
Can I see your lab?
Good work.
You can use the lab whenever you want.
Did you put it together!
It's not equipped as I'd like.
But I might get a centrifuge from Prague next week.
Why are you in the provinces?
To assure no one is too separate?
I like it here.
Are you supposed to convince me?
To do what?
To withdraw my application to leave.
'The workers and farmers financed your studies.
Non it's time to return the favour." That's actually not incorrect.
I'd like to go to The Hague.
That's where the Rembrandt is.
Apply.
I have to go.
You said I could leave?
- Yes.
Didn't you notice anything?
The painting.
The man lying there is Aris Kindt.
He's just been hanged for theft
It's Doctor Tulp giving the anatomy lesson.
They should have cut open the abdomen first.
But they dissected the left hand instead.
There's a mistake.
The hand is wrong.
It's the opposite one.
It's the right hand and it's too large.
I don't think Rembrandt made a mistake.
You see the atlas?
It's an anatomy atlas.
They're all staring at it.
He is, he is, they all are.
And the hand is painted like a depiction in the atlas.
Rembrandt includes something that we can't see, only they can:
The depiction of a hand.
Due to this mistake we no longer look through the doctors' eyes.
We see him, Aris Kindt.
The victim.
We are with him, not with them.
I'm tired, I have to get home.
Me too, shall I drive you?
I need some air.
Fine...
I seemed a bit boastful with the lab and the analysis of the painting.
See you tomorrow.
Did you get the money?
- Yes.
You have to pack it so it's water-tight
- Via the water?
When?
- Soon.
Very soon.
Hello.
Having troubles?
No.
Are you lost?
My colleague had gone... for a pee?
Anything else you need?
Not that I can think of.
Tell me, I'll gel it for you.
I don't know.
It's upholstered.
I read that they are even heatable now.
No. In winter we have to wear gloves, too.
What will it do?
200.
But not here on our roads.
Hello.
- Hello.
'Is that a Mercedes?"
"How much do they cost?"
"How long did you have to wait?
"We waited eight years for ours and that wasn't bad.
Was it at least worth it?
Shit!
I'm getting a coffee.
Want one?
Yes.
Stella asked for you.
Fine.
We hadn't ever been this rich...
The cigars were prime.
We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking and me reading the books, and having a general good time.
I told Jim all about what happened inside... the wreck and at the ferryboat...
What's the matter, Doctor?
I'm tired.
- Have a sleep.
I can't.
See how the moon, it rises And golden stars shine In the heavens on high
Coffee?
The wood stands black and silent And from the meadows climbs Such wondrous white mist
- I'll come back later... and read to you again.
They said I can read alone now.
They'll come and get me soon.
Can you do anything for me, Doctor?
I'll "Y
I can't go back to Torgau,
I can't stand it.
Doctor, I'm having a child.
It's got to go.
Do you want it removed?
- No...
I want to take it away from here.
From Torgau, from this shit country.
Thanks.
Shit
Sorry.
Come along. Lie down for an hour.
No, I'm fine. - I'll wake you and we can swap.
I'll do that.
Thanks.
Yes.
Morning.
- Morning.
Did you sleep?
- Yes.
I brought you a coffee.
Thanks.
Will you put this in your report?
"W. is slowly becoming trusting.
Something like that.
I was working at Eberswalde Hospital.
There were new machines from New Zealand to help prematurely born children who wouldn't make it in a regular incubator.
The operating instructions were in English and 260 pages long.
I worked my way through them.
There was this assistant... She spoke a bit of English. She helped.
She wanted to impress me. One night, when I was as tired as now, she brought me a blanket, told me to sleep, she'd take care of things.
She switched on the machines that night, made only one mistake:
She confused Celsius and Fahrenheit. Massive pressure was generated.
The premature infants' retinas detached.
There were two of them, Maik and Jennifer.
We managed to save them, but they were blinded for life.
It was my responsibility.
Research was out.
No more Berlin, no more Charité.
These gentlemen offered to have the case hushed up.
I could transfer to a provincial hospital in exchange for confidentiality and my delivering reports.
I have no ambitions in this regard.
How long ago was this?
Three years.
What kind of machines were they?
The ones from New Zealand.
Was my story too long?
Too neat?
Can you do something for Stella?
Keep her here for longer?
Yes.
Two days, maybe three.
And then what?
Do you know what Torgau is?
The Torgau work-house?
Your lot are good at euphemisms.
Torgau is an extermination camp a Socialist one.
I asked you a question!
What?
What then?
I've no idea.
I called them.
Two days, no more.
Is the story true?
Maik and Jennifer.
I have to sleep.
Let me go!
Barbara!
Let go.
Now.
Barbara!
Coming.
Doctor Wolff?
- Yes.
Andre sent me.
Doctor Reiser.
To tune the piano.
Thanks but no thanks.
I'm having a bath.
Please leave.
Good bye.
Andre gave me this. For you.
How long would it take?
An hour.
She's keen, Tatjana Kasankina.
It's her third Olympic medal.
She gave birth two years ago but she's in great form.
Tatjana Kasankina it seems to have gone well.
But the GDR's Christiane Warlenberg is keeping up, and then Ulrike...
Fall from the third floor, on the ground 20 minutes.
It was the janitor who found him...
Dislocation of the knee, injury to the head.
Pump his stomach quick.
He's being X-rated. The solvent wasn't too dangerous.
Fine.
Attempted suicide.
The authorities must be informed
We let him come round first.
- Yes.
Please fetch the X-rays.
Am I supposed to thank you?
I hate that kind of surprise.
The piano tuner?
- Yes.
He said he'd offered you an appointment.
If I need a piano tuner, I'll get one myself.
That's right.
If you need someone, find them yourself.
Exactly.
I won't help.
- I don't want help.
And the broken socket?
What's that?
Found someone for it?
Electricians are rare.
- What's it to you?
Nothing.
You can pay with the West German cigarettes from your red case.
We're ready.
- Thanks.
There's nothing to see but a clot might have formed.
The skull would have to be opened to make sure.
It seems a huge risk now he's stabilising.
We'll observe him.
If there's no improvement, we'll have to operate.
His reflexes are normal.
To heal and cold?
- Those too.
We'll have to wait.
I came by bike, too.
There's an old wooden cross at the beginning of the way. A few meters further you're suddenly on a hill And at the bottom is the sea.
It's the prettiest place I know.
Have you seen it yet?
It's prettier still by night.
We should take the short cut through the forest here.
How about it?
Sorry, but I hate the sea. That's just how it is.
See you tomorrow.
Till then.
Gerhard has met a girl.
She wants to go over to the West.
He says he loves her.
Because she can't follow him.
Barbara!
I could come over to you. Come here and live with you.
What do you mean here?
- Here.
It's possible, some have done it.
Like who?
Who cares?
I could be happy here with you.
They'd welcome me here, too.
You're nuts!
You can't be happy here.
There are two boulders, a large and a small one.
You're to wait there.
There's an infrared device in the boat, he can see you by night.
It'll all be quick.
Will you be there?
I'll be waiting for you in Denmark.
- Denmark?
It's not far.
When?
Saturday night.
This weekend?
I'm on duty,
I'll have to switch.
Do you need a good excuse?
There must be some stupid parade or other!
Nobody would believe me.
YES...
I'm coming.
There's a meeting in the restaurant.
It'll be an hour, not longer.
Should I bring you something?
I think I'll have fallen asleep.
Once you've come over, you'll be able to sleep late.
Why's that?
I earn enough, you won't need to work.
Consign it to memory, then bum the paper.
Shit
Do you know how long they're off for?
An hour at most.
- It'll be at least two, then.
I'm Steffi.
Your health.
Barbara.
Pleased to meet you.
What did you get as a present?
As a present?
Nothing.
I always get mine in advance. It's best that way for both parties
LOOK.
He told me he loved me.
Wait.
Want some?
Have a look!
He told me he'd marry me.
He wanted me to choose a ring.
Crazy. huh?
Nice, right?
It's not the most expensive one.
It's pretty.
- Yes, it is.
Show me your hands.
Wait.
It's too big for you.
Gee, you're size 17!
You've got pretty hands.
Thanks.
- Do you look after them?
Which one would you take?
Maybe that one.
Yes, it's really lovely.
If he marries me, do you think they'll let me leave?
I don't think so.
Do you know your stuff about this?
Bye.
Open up, it's for you.
No.
- It is.
Please, no!
Let down your hair.
Bend forward spread your legs.
Lots of fruit jam, bread and cheese.
What kind of cheese?
Soft cheese
Do you like it?
No.
And yesterday?
For breakfast?
- Lunch.
Fricassee.
Right. We had that too.
The rhubarb compote was good
I had jelly.
Was jelly on offer yesterday?
Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit
Jelly again.
See you later.
The questions were good.
He has no memory loss.
You are still concerned.
I don't know, it's all normal:
the tests, his memory, his reactions.
What do his parents say?
- They're relieved.
Did they find anything strange?
I'll see you a little later. Bon appetit.
Sorry I was so abrupt yesterday.
You always are.
- No.
You are.
I have a favour to ask you.
- Ah, I see!
What do you see?
Easy.
Can I have the weekend off in exchange for night shifts? It's important.
You want to go to the parade in Berlin?
No, I want to do up the apartment.
Then do that.
Excuse me, this is for the laundry. Thanks.
How is he?
Astonishingly well.
Please check Mario yourself.
It's cerebral contusion.
I have a bad feeling, I don't know why.
I'd like to do more tests tomorrow. Will you help me?
I'm off tomorrow.
- Same here.
Can't you spare two hours?
On Sunday I can.
What time?
A 11..
Good night.
To you, too.
No!
No!
No, no, no...
You can go home tomorrow.
Wait.
Can I speak to you?
Did you visit Mario?
- Yes.
Will you come along?
- What for?
I'm Doctor Wolff, he's my patient. Please.
You were crying.
I wasn't.
When you were with Mario.
Are you together with Mario?
It came today with the mail.
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU
We'd returned from a party in Stralsund.
I danced with two Cubans. Danced, that's all.
Then Werner called him and told him God knows what.
You cried because you felt guilty?
No, because he's so cold.
People are often restrained after attempted suicide.
Something's wrong.
I kissed him and he listed what he'd been eating here.
It's not normal.
If he was angry, fine. But he's so cold.
Mario?
Yes.
Angie came to visit you.
Yes.
You'd written her a letter.
When?
A good-bye letter.
What did you write to her!
Could you close the window?
The window is closed.
Thanks.
Do you want Angie to visit tomorrow?
What do we eat tomorrow?
Do you know?
Shit!
It's Doctor Wolff, I absolutely must speak to Doctor Reiser.
Ah, I see...
Where is that?
Do you know where I can find Dr. Reiser?
The doctor isn't here.
- I know, but where is he?
He's at the "Schütz".
- And where is that?
It's the café on the square.
- Right, thanks.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Doctor Reiser.
- He's upstairs.
Top of the stairs, on the left.
I'm looking for Doctor Reiser.
I'm Doctor Wolff, I'm from the clinic.
He's in Friedl's room.
Could I speak to him for a moment?
Doctor Reiser, there's someone to see you.
Excuse me.
She's pretty, your girlfriend.
I saw your car, Doctor. I have to speak to you.
Are you on such formal terms?
Do all doctors act like that?
Only sometimes.
Barbara, I'm coming.
This is for you both.
Thank you.
Klaus, I have to go.
I'll come over again later.
Wait for me, please.
How is she?
- I gave her morphine.
That's good, she won't suffer.
You'll let me know...
You were right, Mario has to be operated on.
His girlfriend came by last night. He'd sent her a good-bye letter. He can't remember it.
He remembers everything but his emotions have vanished.
You mean I need an operation because my own emotions...
We'll go to the clinic, I'll pack your bike.
That was morphine.
- Yes.
What's wrong with her?
Friedl is dying of cancer.
Are you family?
- No.
And the officer?
- He's her husband.
Have you known them long?
- Since Friedl grew sick.
Is this usual for you?
- Helping the dying?
Helping assholes.
When they're sick, yes.
Barbara.
Barbara.
What time is it?
Almost 2 o'clock.
I called Fabricius.
How do you know him?
He was my professor. He'll be here this evening to operate.
You'll do the anesthetics.
- What?
You know how to, it was in your file.
Schulze can do it.
Don't you want to be there?
I do.
Fine.
What did she give you?
Tomatoes, courgettes, aubergines, onions.
Do you like ratatouille?
It only takes half an hour.
40 minutes at most.
Come on, it's really good.
It won't be long now.
Are these all doctors' stories?
Yes.
Thai contains one of the best ones 'The District Doctor':
An ugly old doctor is treating a girl in the middle of the country
She has consumption. She's 17, 18, she's feverous. There's a storm, a tempest he can't return, has to stay
He bleeds her and all that rubbish.
The girl has never loved. And must die without having done so, so she takes the old and ugly doctor as her lover.
He sleeps with her!
- No, he's just a stand-in... for all the loves she will never have.
She imagines stories with him, describes his passion, his tenderness,
then she dies.
He returns to his wife and children.
You can have it.
Can I help you?
Do you like cooking?
I'm so happy you're here.
I can't now.
Professor Fabricius is in the theater, I'll be right there.
Is he shaved?
- Ramona did it, it's all ready.
All right.
Stella!
Barbara, there you are
The bastards!
What is that?
Pain killers.
And the other jab?
Caffeine.
What does it do?
It'll keep you awake.
Barbara, don't leave me.
Don't go.
Barbara?
She won't be coming back.
Have you arrested her?
Go home, Andre.
Stella, Stella.
Stay just there.
Here's the money.
Come along.
Lie down.
Hold on tight.
- What?
Hold on tight.
Barbara!
I'll trust you.
You'll notice that I got you 10% more than the previous season.
10% that you'll soon have off me.
Where are you going?
I don't want to say.
- Why not?
- None of your business.
- You're hiding something?
- Absolutely!
- Don't forget dinner tomorrow.
- What dinner?
Come on, I've already canceled twice.
The head of programming will be there, the whole lot.
You must come.
OK, calm down. I'll get a train at 5 and be there.
Promise?
Don't forget. I'm a professional.
Hurry up, the train's leaving.
Cycling with Molière
2 days without a fare.
The low season is hard.
What with the rain...
You're lucky today, it's brightened up.
Lovely sunlight, no?
It's our microclimate.
I love "Dr Morange". I never miss an episode.
You're my mom's favorite actor.
She broke her hip 10 days ago.
- She can't move.
- The hip, of course...
She's out now.
She just has to do physiotherapy.
But the waiting list is long, it'll be a year.
- Where does she live?
- Pessac, near Bordeaux.
That's great, I know Professor Delahaye, head of physio at Bordeaux hospital.
Your mother's name?
Denise Baker.
Like a baker.
Voicemail.
Hello Robert, it's Gauthier Valence.
I have a favor to ask.
Here we are.
Thanks, bye.
Thanks for my mom.
Anyone home?
Change the septic tank?
You must change the pipes at least, they're crumbling.
No wonder it stinks.
- It's going everywhere.
- How much will it cost?
I'll do a quote, but I'd say around 5,000 euros. 5,000 euros? To change 3 pipes?
I told your uncle to do it 10 years ago.
You should scrap that and connect to the mains.
The stench is awful.
What a mess...
What are you doing here?
I was passing, I thought I'd call in, Serge.
You were passing?
On the Ile de Ré?
I have cousins in La Rochelle.
Cousins in La Rochelle?
Yes.
Remember, I called you a month back?
On the cellphone?
Yes, I think so.
I've only got a landline now.
On the landline, then.
You hung up cos you had boiler problems.
What do we do about the tank?
Close it, I can't decide.
You should get connected.
I don't like being connected, I like being independent.
Close it up, sorry.
This house is a nightmare.
All the plumbing needs doing.
It'll cost millions.
Something to drink?
You want a vodka? A coffee?
I'd love a tea.
I'm not sure if I've got tea.
How did you get this house?
I had an uncle who lived here with his cats.
Us 10 nephews weren't interested in him.
I always sent him a Christmas card.
One day I got a call from the notary.
He'd left me his house.
Unbelievable.
What's that look for?
What did you expect, a house with white floorboards?
Not at all, I like it.
It...
It has charm.
At first I wanted to sell it.
The island realtors offered me a fortune.
Then when I stopped working, I moved in, temporarily...
- 3 years ago.
- You took up painting?
I've no such pretentions.
I do still lives.
Well, I enlarge photos.
I find it relaxing.
The days aren't easy.
When did we last see each other?
5, 6 years ago?
6 years.
On the shoot in Hungary, remember?
The director went berserk.
Yes, and that English actress didn't want to show her tits.
And that fat guy who fell off his horse!
Wasn't that where there was a terrible storm?
It was terrifying.
We always dined together and you talked to me about Molière.
I've followed your career, you've had a lot of hits.
It's extraordinary, remarkable...
It's funny, I don't know why, but lately I've been wondering what had become of you.
As you can see, I'm fine.
Then I remembered our conversations, and I thought maybe I could offer Serge something.
- Not acting, I hope.
- Well, yes, in fact.
Save your breath. My film days are over.
Even if Spielberg offered me a script.
Look, they go on the fire.
I'm not talking cinema.
I'm talking about a play.
A play?
Yes. I'm offering you a play.
You mean a role in a play?
Obviously. A role in a play.
You're out of your mind.
I haven't been on stage in years.
All that's behind me now.
Let me tell you which play.
I don't want to know the name of the play.
I told you.
Theater, cinema, I'm done.
It's a dirty business, with vulgar people who lie and betray.
No way.
There are still some decent people.
Who, for example? Name one.
Me.
I'm decent.
You?
Well let's say you're the exception.
You didn't come just to talk about that?
Oh, no,
I knew very well what you'd say.
I was just wondering...
You know Agnès and I divorced?
I didn't know.
I met someone else, quite a while ago.
A wonderful woman called Christine.
- Your new wife?
- No, we're not married.
Your new partner, then.
Yes.
Christine used to come to the Ile de Ré as a child.
She has fond memories.
So I thought maybe I could find a place to rent here.
You want to rent a house?
That's right.
And perhaps, you never know, if there was a good opportunity, I'd maybe buy something.
Seriously? You want to buy a house?
Exactly.
I've never had my own place.
I'll call Meynard.
I know a great realtor. A bit of an idiot, but...
Wait, there's no rush.
Meynard?
I've got a friend here.
It's Serge.
I'm with a friend who's looking to buy a house.
We're here for the visit.
The prices are insane.
That's the Ile de Ré.
Nothing under a million euros.
Oh no, you can still find bargains.
I love "Dr Morange", I never miss it.
And that film with the monkey, my wife and I were in stitches.
Who's Dr Morange?
It's a series I do on TF1. About a brain surgeon.
A guy who can operate in a blizzard with a plastic knife and still save the girl.
My mom loved the one in the Sahara.
Snowstorm, sandstorm, you get the idea.
OK, I've got the keys.
The sellers are in a corner.
They're fighting over the will, classic stuff.
Obviously, you'd have to rip it all out.
That would have to go.
And that, and that.
I've got some guys who work really well.
You'd have a lovely room.
It's not too damp.
You won't find better.
Shall we go upstairs?
You have to imagine the work's done, then you'll have space.
Why buy an old house and rip it all out?
How's the roof?
That's often where the problem is.
Fully re-done.
True, right now it's depressing. It's raining, the ugly wallpaper...
You have to think white floorboards, stripped walls.
- Sublime.
- It's bottom-end.
- That's a bit harsh.
- I say it's low-end.
He's hard to please.
There's no fooling Mr Tanneur.
I've got another house at Les Portes, a real gem.
Can we visit it now?
I have to call the owner.
Just out of curiosity, what was the play you're offering me?
"The Misanthrope".
You're staging "The Misanthrope"?
I have the theater, a producer, and I start casting in 2 weeks.
"The Misanthrope".
No less.
For your first play?
I've always dreamed of performing it.
And you're offering me Alceste.
Well, you remember our chats in Hungary?
You said Alceste thinks he can change people.
By telling them the truth, he can shift their views.
In fact, he's an optimist.
I don't get your meaning.
You used to say that Philinte is the real pessimist.
He knows it's no use battling society, that one must just accept its rules.
So what?
So I wanted to offer you the role of Philinte.
Me, play Philinte?
Yes, Philinte. What's the problem?
I don't set foot on stage for 3 years, then you show up and offer me Philinte.
That's gutsy.
You said he's the play's great role.
It's a great role, but secondary.
He has 5 scenes.
The meaty role is Alceste, the most complex in classical French theater.
Your first Molière, your first play, and you take Alceste.
How else would I get the role?
Even Jouvet wasn't ready for Alceste.
In 30 years of acting...
Oh, what's the point?
Wait a second!
Listen.
What is it now?
- What if we alternate?
- I don't understand.
One week you'd play Alceste and I'd play Philinte.
The next, we'd switch.
It'd be a first.
Have you gone nuts?
We swap roles and everybody's happy.
That's absurd.
You don't get it, I no longer act.
The owner's expecting us.
I'm going back to Paris.
Aren't we going to see the house?
Another time.
Come on, let's go see it.
Could you take me back to Mr Tanneur's to get my case?
And after 5.47pm, is there another?
8.12pm, departure... Arriving? 11.38pm in Paris, fine.
Thank you, bye.
I can get the last train.
Stay for dinner, we've hardly spoken.
I shouldn't have come.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Leave me, pray. What strange humor is this?
Leave me, I say. Out of my sight
Can't you listen, without anger?
I want to be angry...
I want to be angry, and I will not listen
I cannot understand your bursts of temper
And though we're friends, I'm first...
I cannot understand your bursts of temper
And though we're friends, I'm first
I, your friend?
Strike that
I may have been so until now But after what you just did, I am no longer
I want no place in rotten hearts
Am I so guilty, Alceste?
Heavens, you should die for shame, 'Tis inexcusable
That's good, you know it well.
I've worked on it for a while.
30 years, in my case.
Listen, I'm not saying I'll do it.
Here's my suggestion:
Come back tomorrow, we'll read it off the cuff, and we'll see how it goes.
Tomorrow?
Why, you got plans?
No, but I wanted to leave late morning.
Plus I've got a crazy week in Paris.
There's something I don't get.
You come to see me for "The Misanthrope",
I say we'll do it, you say you're busy?
- No, but...
- But what?
You're right. I'll make 3 calls, then I can stay.
OK, where will you sleep tonight?
I booked at Le Clocher.
Forget it, I'll put you up.
- You can have the guest room.
- The guest room?
Usually I don't heat it, but for you, I will.
The size of this house makes heating a nightmare.
I'll tidy this up in 5 minutes, and it'll be fit for a king.
It's very kind, but I'd prefer the hotel.
See you tomorrow, then.
I'm staying on the Ile de Ré.
Just find an excuse.
But you promised me.
How's that going to make me look?
Listen, I'm trying to put on a play.
Serge wants to rehearse. I can't say no.
I'll keep you posted.
Do you want dinner?
We close at 9.
I'll just take my bag up.
We'll take care of it.
Zoé!
A guest in room 12.
Be right there.
It's fine, I'll do it.
No, it's her job. The young have to learn, too.
Good evening.
Room 12.
May I offer you an aperitif?
With pleasure.
Pineau des Charentes?
Why not?
From the Ile de Ré.
- How shall we do it?
- Here, you do the honors.
We're tossing a coin?
Sure, that's easiest.
Tales I'm Alceste, heads it's you.
If you insist.
You're Alceste.
I'll have my euro back.
Sorry.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Leave me, pray
What strange humor is this?
Leave me, I say. Out of my sight
Can't you listen, without anger?
I want to be angry, and...
Can we start over?
What is it?
What's the matter?
Leave me, pray
What strange humor is this?
Leave me, I say.
Out of my sight
Can't you listen, without anger?
I want to be angry, and I will not listen
I cannot understand...
No, I'm way off.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Leave me, pray
What strange humor is this?
Leave me, I say.
Out of my sight
Can't you listen, without anger?
I want to be angry, and I will not listen
I cannot understand your bursts of temper
And though we're friends, I'm first
I, your friend?
Strike that
I may have been so until now But after what you just did I am no longer
Am I so guilty, Alceste?
Heavens!
Sorry, "heavens" shouldn't be shouted.
Am I so guilty, Alceste?
Heavens, you should...
Wait, sorry.
Am I so guilty, Alceste?
Heavens, you should die for shame
'Tis inexcusable
Men of honor would be scandalized
You greet a man with warm embrace Profess to him utmost tenderness Vow to him your support
Your... This is all wrong!
- Why?
- It's awful!
No, it's good.
It's all wrong.
- It was all forced.
- No, it's a good start.
You think?
That's exactly what notto do.
It was powerful.
Shouting isn't power.
I couldn't get any feeling.
Alceste is no tortured revolutionary.
He's not Che.
Alceste is suffering.
Yes, but he has a comic side.
You have to bring out that aspect.
Neither of us are the right age.
Roles have no age.
Being 20 in those days...
I'm rusty, I haven't acted for 3 years.
I remember your "Tartuffe" at Chaillot, magnificent!
- You saw that?
- You bet.
Your scene with Elmire was great.
I had goose bumps.
You know her?
Yes, she's Italian. Disagreeable, hardly says hello.
Thank you.
I don't get why you're here.
The first time we met was on "Beaumarchais".
I had a big scene, terrible nerves.
The director kept yelling, I was going to pieces.
You took me aside, helped me with the lines.
When I came back on set, I did it in one take.
I did that?
You did.
What use is a man's embrace
His sworn friendship, zeal, esteem and love
His praise to your face
If he does the same to any old wretch?
No self-respecting man can ever accept esteem that's so prostituted
The best honor has no charm If given to all the universe alike
Esteem must show some preference
You may as well love none, as everyone
Since you fall for these vices My God, you're not my kind of fellow
I refuse to share in the fellowship That makes for merit no distinction
I want to be distinguished.
To put it bluntly
The friend of Man's no friend to me
What do you think?
Magnificent.
It's all in there.
You nailed it.
You got the restrained anger.
That's what Alceste is all about, restrained anger.
It's worth giving it a shot, don't you think?
I like your Philinte.
Not argumentative, that's good.
That really whetted my appetite.
So then, what do you think? You'll do it?
I could say yes... But I'll say no.
Why? Give me one good reason?
I don't want to go back.
I just don't want to act anymore.
But you're amazing!
You come out of the garage after 3 years, you start first time.
You're a Rolls Royce!
Is that how you see me?
This "Misanthrope" could be a huge triumph.
Acting's over for me.
You're all fired up by success, but I've lost the spark.
So I just go back, leave you here?
Hold on, you're so impatient.
We're not in a rush.
Here's the deal: There's 4 days till the weekend.
We rehearse those 4 days, then see where we're at.
If it's good, we do it. If not, we don't.
Let's be merciful to human nature
Not judge it with utmost rigor
A little dessert?
Home-made rice pudding?
I won't, thank you.
I've turned the heating up in the rooms.
Thank you.
I just have to say, I love you in "Dr Morange".
You learn lots about the brain, it's very instructive.
Thank you very much.
My favorite episode is with the Chinese girl who's lost her memory, but you operate and she gets it back.
It brought a tear to my eye.
Beautiful.
But I'm interrupting you.
Not at all, Madame Bichet.
You know my niece Zoé, who works here?
She wants to act.
A wonderful vocation.
It's a splendid profession.
But what Zoé wants to do is act in porn films.
- Porn films?
- My sister's not against it.
Lots of nice girls do it these days.
She's worked on 4 or 5 films and earns good money.
Her boyfriend doesn't mind, so...
So...
Could you spare her 5 minutes?
I'd really appreciate it.
Well, I'm not sure how I could help. But I'd be happy to try.
That's very kind. Thank you.
Like you, I see a hundred things each day That might be better, were they different
Yet whatever I see happening I do not fly into a rage, as you do
I gently accept men as they are
Accustom myself to their conduct
And I think that for court or town My calmness is as good philosophy as your choler
But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing?
Lf, perchance, a friend betrays you Tries to steal what's yours Or slanders...
Excuse me.
Christine. How are you?
Did you get my message?
Not before next week, yes.
I can't really talk, we're rehearsing.
Yes, that's right.
Me too, big kiss.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing?
Lf, perchance, a friend betrays you Tries to steal what's yours Or slanders your name
Would you not then grow angry?
Excuse me.
Oh, Raphaëlle.
Sweet of you to call back.
You're sure it's no trouble?
What about the keys?
The cleaner?
Yes.
Madame Françon.
I'll move in tomorrow morning.
Fine.
That's very kind, Raphaëlle.
Thank you so much.
Goodbye.
Raphaëlle De La Puisaye, the publisher.
She's lending me her house.
So, where were we?
"Well-judged calmness".
But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing?
Lf, perchance, a friend betrays you, or...
For fuck's sake! That's insufferable!
I turn my phone off during rehearsal!
You don't even have a cell!
I do! But no one has the number.
We can't carry on like this!
Turn it off, we're doing Molière!
Calm down.
It's rung 15 times already!
Not 15, three times.
Sorry, but I have things to organize in Paris.
Anyway, I'll switch the phone off.
There, it's off. I'll put it in my coat, and I'll put the coat on the bed. There!
Is that OK?
I don't know how you work in Paris.
Cellphones over Molière.
Now I've lost my place.
Start with "calmness".
But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing?
Lf, perchance, a friend betrays you Tries to steal what's yours Or slanders your name
Wait, hold it there.
I don't understand.
You're going to play it so fast?
Am I going so fast?
Yes. Alceste is laying himself open, and you're going flat out.
What do you expect?
You think this a first?
They've been here 10 times before.
Alceste and Philinte are old friends, that's key.
Well I'm not getting friendship.
How exactly do you want me to do it?
I'd say...
No, wait, what you want is...
But can this well-judged calmness Be roused by nothing?
That's a bit labored.
Obviously, that doesn't work.
Yet that's what you're asking me to do.
It's unbelievable.
You can't take the slightest criticism.
You can say what you like, as long as it makes sense.
Yes, I can look on those faults As vices bound with human nature And I am no more shocked
See myself betrayed and robbed And not... Heavens!
Your reasoning is so flawed Better hold your tongue Rail less against your adversary
Who'll solicit for you then?
Reason, my just rights, equity
You'll call on no judge?
No. Is my cause unjust?
I agree with you, yet it niggles
I won't budge a step, right or wrong
- Beware
- I won't budge
Your adversary is cunning
No matter
- You're mistaken
- We'll see
It will be a joy to lose my suit
But surely...
Incredible...
Alceste is dragged to justice and puts up no defense.
That's just what happened to me during my depression.
Is it true, then?
Were you really depressed?
Absolutely.
I even did 5 weeks' sleep therapy, at Sainte-Anne hospital.
I had to stop work.
That's not the rumor in the trade.
They said you were in a luxury clinic, that you were just fine.
David Gilbert said that?
I'm just saying what I heard, that's all.
I heard you walked out a week before filming.
I couldn't walk. I lost 12kg.
All David could think about was his crappy film.
You think he came to see me even once?
A producer with whom I'd made 5 films over 20 years.
And who then sues me.
I don't understand, if you couldn't work, why not get a psychiatric report?
Screw psychiatrists!
I thought we could find an amicable solution.
Instead, what does he do? He sues.
He claimed 500,000 euros in damages.
Wait, I really don't get this.
You had a trump card. Why not use it?
Because I wanted to know just how far he'd go.
David was like a brother to me.
We vacationed together, I was godfather to his daughter.
You see, Gauthier, that's the reality of this business.
There's no friendship, no fidelity, no loyalty.
That screwed me up so much, I ended up here.
I haven't moved since.
Heads. I'm Philinte.
- You be Alceste, if you like.
- No, it's fine.
Being too perfect may be blameworthy
Sound judgment shuns extremes And will be virtuous in its sobriety
The unbending moral of old times Clashes with our age and common usage
They ask of mortals perfection
We must yield to the times, and with inflection
"Inflection", no, that's all wrong.
What do you mean?
Because "inflection", as you're saying, you...
You have to stress the final syllable.
You have to stress it, or there's one missing.
So it's: "Inflec-shee-on", "perfec-shee-on".
That's utterly archaic.
Those are alexandrines.
They have 12 syllables.
We must yield... with inflection as you said it, is one short. It's only 11.
You have to say:
We must yield to the times, and with inflec-shee-on.
Screw the syllables.
I'm not doing the classics at school.
It's for today's audience.
Is that so?
Because you know what today's audience likes?
People will come because it deals with today's issues.
They don't want ancient.
I suppose you like coloring movies, because black-and-white is outdated.
I don't see the link.
Molière's no screenwriter.
He didn't write TV series.
Molière's about alexandrines.
Swallow them up if you like, but they must be delivered.
I'm acting TV style?
I didn't say you're acting for TV.
Molière has a musical structure, it's organic.
You can't think about the verse, you have to feel it!
Our job is to connect with people, agreed?
To avoid pointless elitism, acting like a lord, your little finger raised.
When you do the classics, you must respect the verse!
- Know what Jouvet used to say?
- Enough!
Screw Jouvet!
Jouvet said if you take a syllable out of a line, it's like asking for a kilo of oranges, and getting 800g! It's called theft!
Here's what we'll do:
If you want to say it old style, fine.
Inflec-shee-on, prepara-shee-on, masturba-shee-on, whatever.
But let me say the text my way, OK?
What is it?
Hello, Mr Maynard.
Come in.
Hello, how are you?
Fine. I've come... about the houses.
Which houses?
You didn't get my message?
We're rehearsing so we turned our phones off!
I've 2 great houses...
Never mind the houses, we're rehearsing Molière!
Hang on, I'm interested.
Let's go see the houses.
- Shall we, Mr Meynard?
- Yes, sure...
Come on then, let's go.
- You with us?
- Coming!
Hello.
Can I help you?
Christophe Meynard from the realtor, for the visit.
Yes, the visit.
I brought these gentlemen.
Hello.
Hello. You might have informed me.
We haven't even talked terms.
I thought it would be OK.
I tell you now, you're not sole agent.
I'm in a hurry. I've contacted another realtor.
- Is that a problem?
- No, just that...
That's how it is.
Better find a buyer then.
Come on, I'll show you round.
The main bedroom.
What's the total floor space?
110 square meters for the house, 100 for the garden.
I'll show you upstairs.
The kids' bedrooms?
There's no kids' bedrooms.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
This is the office and the library.
Huge gaffe on the kids' room.
- You think?
- Yeah, a huge gaffe.
Classy place, don't you think?
It's a nice property. What's she asking?
1.8 million.
1.8 million for 110m2?
That's more than Paris!
Let's not hang about.
Excuse us, we'll be off.
Sorry, I'm very busy.
It's alright, you weren't expecting us.
If you like we could meet some other time, for a drink perhaps.
No thanks.
You do know that Gauthier is an actor, a very famous one.
I used to be well-known, too, but I quit, so I'm less known now.
We don't know French actors in Italy.
I insist, meet us for a drink. Or dinner.
What do you think Serge?
An excellent idea.
I ought to be flattered to have a drink with 2 famous actors, but I'm not in the mud.
You mean "in the mood".
That's right. In the mood.
And I should add, I don't like actors.
They're narcissistic.
What makes you think we're narcissistic?
She's got a point, you are quite.
I am not narcissistic.
Well, I'd like to be left alone.
Gentlemen, goodbye.
Goodbye.
About the contract...
Drop it in the letterbox.
Thanks for the visit.
You know, actors may be narcissistic but they have feelings...
Yeah, sure.
Did you see that?
- Who does she think she is?
- So ill-mannered...
What a pretentious bitch!
She won't sell like that.
The mill was working until 1920.
Back then the isle grew its own wheat.
When you close your eyes you can smell the flour.
- How much are they asking?
- 1.15 million.
But they'd drop to 1 million.
That's more reasonable.
Are you kidding?
1 million for a house like this?
It's a snip.
You could put a bedroom here.
Sure, do some work and after 6 months, you can sell for at least 300,000 more.
It's a unique location.
You have to fall in love with a house.
It's like a woman, there's a little voice inside. You have to listen to that voice.
- I have to talk to Christine.
- Surprise her!
You're kidding. 1 million!
What if she doesn't like it?
What's a million to you?
It's nothing.
What's an episode worth?
I don't want to say.
Come on, don't be coy.
Really, how much per episode?
- You really want to know?
- Yes.
200,000.
How many episodes a season?
Six.
Shit! What do you with it?
Put it under the mattress?
- Why are you getting cross?
- I'm not.
I just don't understand.
I mean, you still act small-time, when actually you're at the top of the heap.
It's like you're in denial.
Let me tell you something.
I'm not buying this house.
And for the record, I don't like the Ile de Ré.
I hate the whole Catholic family vibe, the blond kids, it's awful.
It's the opposite of sexy.
I like sun. It's freezing here!
Sorry, last summer was wonderful.
The isle has a microclimate.
Screw your microclimate!
I want heat, and to walk about all day in a G-string if I feel like it.
The Ile de Ré is still ranked France's 2nd favorite holiday spot.
It's in Le Point magazine.
You can't come to the Ile de Ré and not go cycling.
That one's too old. This one's fine.
It's a bit dirty, I'll clean that up.
There.
Here, try it.
Wait a second.
That's OK.
The brakes don't work!
No problem, there are no hills here, nothing.
It's a total wreck.
My eyes are far too offended
Both court and town provoke my spleen
- I fall into black... ... humors and deep sorrow
When I see men treat each other as theydo.
Your turn...
I see nothing but base flattery
- Injustice...
... Treachery Selfishness, deceit
My eyes are far too offended...
Asshole!
Piece of shit bicycle!
What an asshole!
Give me a hand!
They're a bunch of scum.
Come on, this way.
Come on.
Your fucking bike's got no brakes!
That stinks, it's awful.
Dammit!
These were my uncle's.
They should fit you.
Here.
You're in great shape. Do you work out?
A little. 3 or 4 times a week.
You must drive the chicks wild.
And this Christine, how long's it been?
Three years.
She's a brain surgeon.
I met her researching "Dr Morange".
Where are you at?
She won't move in with me and vice versa.
And she's got this daughter aged 12 who doesn't speak to me.
Not even hello.
Sounds like a bit of a dead end.
We broke up 10 times, but...
Maybe you should turn the page?
No, you don't get it. I really do love her.
I've become a solitary creature.
Are you kidding?
If you really wanted to hide, you wouldn't be here.
You'd be in depths of the Larzac, the Vercors or the Aveyron.
The Ile de Ré's not really off the beaten track.
It's cos of the bridge. That spoilt it.
Well,
I'll be off.
Wait, don't go yet.
Deep down, I'm glad you came.
I like acting with you.
Thank you.
So, what do you say?
You want me to say if I'll do it?
Yes, I'd like that.
It's not that simple.
Yes it is. You say yes and we don't mention it again.
Wait, I've got 2 days. That's the deal.
You're not giving an inch.
10 o'clock tomorrow, then.
I can't. I'm going to La Rochelle.
- But you don't like the town.
- I have a hospital appointment.
- Nothing serious, I hope.
- No, just a vasectomy.
You're only out 30 minutes.
We can rehearse after lunch.
You're getting a vasectomy?
I've been thinking about it for years.
6 months ago I nearly did it. Now I feel ready.
You don't want to screw anymore?
That's not it. Vasectomy's nothing like castration.
It just means severing the sperm ducts.
It has no adverse effect on erection or ejaculation.
So what's the point?
To avoid any chance of bringing a kid into the world.
I already made the mistake of having a son. Never again.
You've got a son?
Not a word for 10 years.
He works in the nuclear industry.
Atomic fission, Chernobyl, Fukushima, that's guys like him.
I don't want kids either, but the snip?
I need to make this gesture.
It's a courageous gesture.
A vasectomy!
Nonsense!
Here you are.
You remember my niece, Zoé?
- The one who wants to act?
- Zoé, yes.
Could you have a quick word?
Her mom would be thrilled.
- Of course.
- That's kind.
Zoé, can you come here?
Hurry up!
Today's youth, always sleeping. They're so tired.
You're off to Ms De La Puisaye's?
Yes, I'm staying at her place.
It's at St Martin en Ré.
- Do you know it?
- No.
I can call a taxi, if you like.
Alright.
- You could make an effort.
- I'm up at dawn.
- I've made pancakes.
- That's sweet of you.
Say hello to Mr Valence.
- Hello.
- Hello, Zoé.
I didn't dare ask before, but can I get an autograph?
With pleasure.
It's for Cookie, my boyfriend.
Well, if it's for Cookie...
He's a fan.
Hi. Can I give you a ride? It'll be quicker than the bus.
That's kind, but I'm in no rush.
Sorry about yesterday. I just had a call from my husband.
We're having a messy divorce.
It upsets me every time we talk.
It was silly to say I don't like actors. I don't know why I did.
I'm with you. I can't stand them either.
You see, we agree.
My name's Francesca.
Hello, Francesca.
You coming, then?
No, women drivers scare me.
Because of your mother?
She drove badly and you were traumatized...
I know a guy who had a vasectomy.
He couldn't walk for 6 months.
Really?
The surgeon must have cut a nerve.
It's a very delicate spot, that's sure.
My ex said he didn't want kids.
I was dumb enough to listen.
He left me for a woman and had a son.
Hence the sale?
Yes.
I want to move on.
We're all going to die.
No point getting attached to things.
In 30 years, my hand'll be covered in liver spots.
We'll be all flabby and wrinkled. That's life.
Time destroys everything.
I should have taken the bus.
I'll come back around 2pm, OK?
Alright, thanks a lot.
Excuse me, I'm here to see Prof Rubinstein.
Ah, Mr Tanneur. Sorry for the delay.
- The head nurse is sick.
- Yes, wait...
Finding a replacement, you know it's not easy in hospitals nowadays.
- See you in theater.
- I wanted...
Yes, Gilbert, what do you expect? I always get roped in.
I wanted to ask...
Undress and put on a blue gown.
I'll be back in 5 minutes.
Yes, Gilbert, what can I say?
Everything will be fine.
The anesthetic.
No, listen. I've changed my mind.
I don't want it.
- You don't want what?
- The operation!
Isn't it a bit late to say that now?
Thank you.
Thanks, goodbye.
Hello, Mr Valence.
Hello, how are you?
Remember you told me to call Prof Delahaye in Bordeaux?
- Yes.
- About my mother.
I mentioned your name.
But he never called back.
That's not like him.
Hello, I'm a friend of Raphaëlle.
Yes, I was expecting you.
Don't worry, I'll call the professor back.
Goodbye.
This is very nice.
When you think what it all cost...
My husband worked on the conversion.
It was never good enough for her.
She made them rip out the tiles. The red wasn't red enough.
Honestly...
There was a fisherman's cottage just there, demolished in the blink of an eye.
A whole family could have lived there.
To think there's homeless in France...
I agree with you, such inequalities are shocking.
What's that?
That's the Jacuzzi.
Animals used to drink there.
Now Madame splashes around here at night, with no bathing suit...
Mind if I play some music?
Not at all.
I saw my notary in La Rochelle.
He's got a buyer for the house.
You must be glad.
In fact, no.
Exactly the opposite, I'm sad.
It's silly.
That's me all over.
I think one thing, and feel another.
I detest nostalgia, yet I regret many things.
I think people's contradictions are beautiful.
Really?
I went to Trousse Chemise, round the lighthouse and back by the marshes.
You've got the cycling bug.
I love it.
Remember Francesca?
Of course, Madame hates actors.
I got over it, you see.
Sorry, the house is sold.
Congratulations. Anyway, I've decided not to buy.
Rehearsal in 20 minutes?
See you then. Be careful.
How about that?
You bump into the hot Italian and drop the vasectomy.
- Nonsense.
- That was it.
You're going to have a bunch of piccoli bambini.
Are you done?
You're a pain.
While you were in town, I got to know Zoé.
Really? Who's Zoé?
The niece of Madame Bichet, owner of Le Clocher.
Zoé's an actress.
She wants to study acting, so I said she could drop by.
No way. You know no one attends rehearsal.
I knew you'd react that way.
But you should know, Zoé is an actress in porn films.
She's already done 4 or 5.
It sounds like a very interesting job.
No kidding.
She's been at it 6 months but still has a certain candor.
I can't decide if she's really dumb or above it all.
Did you ask her about the shoots?
Sure.
She said porn actors are very nice folk, there's a good atmosphere, but she doesn't like the hours.
You have to get up at dawn then drive to the set.
She said, and I quote:
A double penetration at 8 in the morning, it's not easy.
A double penetration at 8am, it's not easy...
Double penetration at 8, tough.
At 10 o'clock, it's fine.
You have to say, we live in an extraordinary age.
Anyway, shall I tell her it's off?
Absolutely not! What time did you say?
I don't know, around 4.
That leaves us time to rehearse.
Heads or tails?
Zoé brings you luck. You're Alceste.
I'll spare no one on this point
My eyes are far too offended Both court and town provoke my spleen I fall into black humors and deep sorrow
I see nothing but base flattery Injustice, treachery, selfishness, deceit
I cannot endure it, it maddens me, and my aim Is to break with all mankind
This wrath's too harsh I laugh at your black moods
And see in us two brothers in the school for husbands...
Wait, why've you been limping for 10 minutes?
It's Alceste's back story.
I work on the character's past.
I imagined Alceste was forced by his father to ride a horse. He fell, and ever since he's limped.
His hatred for society is a cry of rage at the father.
There you go.
No, really, have done with your pranks
The world will not change for all your meddling
Since you so admire frankness I tell you frankly, this distemper Is seen by all as comedy
Such wrath against today's mores Makes you a laughing-stock for many
So much the better, heavens! 'Tis what I ask
That was too much.
So much the better, heavens! 'Tis what I ask
It's a good sign. I'm overjoyed
I hate mankind so much I'd be cross if I was thought mild
You have great spite for mankind
Yes, I have an unutterable...
That's not right.
What d'you mean?
It's an unutterable hatred...
No, you're mistaken.
It's not "unutterable".
I have a fearful hatred for it
It's not "fearful". It's "frightful". "A frightful hatred. '
Yes, I have a frighftul hatred for it
It's funny how you get stuck on that.
It's strange.
As if for you, hatred is something unutterable.
As if hatred cannot be put in words.
Funny...
The exact opposite of Alceste.
Wait, I said the wrong word, it's no big deal.
Yes, it is.
It says a lot about you and your way of acting.
You invent an absurd thing - this limping - and yet you cannot embrace the violence of the character.
It's odd.
You're playing Alceste whilst retaining your scruples.
You know, it's as if your kindness, your education... as if something's embarrassing you.
I'd say it's your sheer civility.
What do you know about my civility?
What is civility, anyway? Explain that to me.
- Well, civility's...
- What, exactly?
- It's what stops you...
- Go on, say it.
...getting to the emotion.
- Getting where?
- To the feeling.
Of what?
What civility? What feeling?
The emotion of the character's actions.
You know what? I'm sick of this.
I've had all I can take, you hear?
That's enough.
Hello.
Hello, Zoé.
I got a bit lost, am I late?
It's fine. Is everything OK?
Yes, fine.
- Shall we go inside?
- Hello, Miss. Serge Tanneur.
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.
Would you like a drink?
I don't have time. Cookie said we have to go to Paris.
And who's Cookie?
My boyfriend.
We're getting married in September.
Bravo.
This way, please.
We're going to Bucharest for work, to meet some people.
What are you doing there?
There's many shoots there.
Not like France, very pro.
So you're really going to make a career in porn?
Maybe not a career. I don't want to do it my whole life.
Just to put some cash away, then we'll see.
And Cookie comes on shoots so I'm not on my own.
Shall we do a bit of "The Misanthrope"?
I did that one in school.
It's about a Catholic guy who lives with a family and wants to bed the wife.
That's "Tartuffe". We're doing "The Misanthrope".
It's about a guy who's mad at all his friends.
- Shall we do a scene?
- Yes, great.
- You'd like that?
- Yes, sure.
If it's not too long. My train's at 8.
Shall we do the scene with Oronte?
Great. A wonderful scene.
- So, who's Oronte?
- I'll do Oronte.
- I like him.
- You want to do Oronte?
Oronte is a member of the court who comes to read a poem to Alceste.
And do you mean to suggest by this That I am wrong to wish?
I don't say that
But I meant, frigid writing bores
Thisweakness is enough to damn a man Though he may have many fine qualities
For men are judged by failings
Then do you think my sonnet poor?
I don't say that
Go seek your praise elsewhere
Don't take such lofty airs
Faith, mighty sir, I'll take whatever air I please
That was wonderful, wonderful!
Remarkable.
Well?
I told Cookie I'll be a bit late.
Did you like it?
Yes, it was great. I really loved it.
I should be going.
But it was very kind to invite me.
You're leaving right away?
I have a train at 8.
No, you must read a few Molière verses.
- Verses?
- Yes, some alexandrines.
Leave her be.
Zoé has acting ambitions, so she can read to us.
You want to be an actress, don't you?
Find me the scene with... Célimène.
I think it's scene 3, act 4.
You're mad, with your jealous frenzies
It's a bit tricky.
Say it simply, with rhythm.
I'd like to know what might compel me To stoop for you to base deceit
Orwhy, if my heart leant another way I wouldn't say it with sincerity
Does the assurance of my feelings not defend me from your suspicions?
What are they worth, against such a pledge?
Don't you offend me by heeding them?
And since our heart makes such effort When it comes down to confessing love Since the honor of our sex, enemy of passion
Such suspicions deserve my anger And you are not worthy of my esteem
How was that?
You can say if...
No...
It was...
It was very, very good.
It was good.
To think that next week she'll be in Bucharest...
We could've done something for her, no?
No, she's old enough to sort things out.
All the same...
We're just a pair of old farts.
Why not come spend the weekend here?
Christine, you always say we're not together often.
You wouldn't be in my way.
OK, let's think about it.
Big kiss.
Yes, love you too.
I turned a knob and the Jacuzzi went crazy.
It was bubbling like mad.
I tried to get up, slipped and nearly died.
I was alone. I shouted, no one came.
I took 30 minutes to get my breath back.
What a way to go!
James Dean in a Porsche, Gauthier Valence in a Jacuzzi.
- It's not funny.
- That's a good one.
Not funny at all.
I have to go.
I've got to finish packing for the move.
- Will you come by tonight?
- With pleasure.
I've still got loads to get rid of, books, ornaments...
We'll come after rehearsal.
OK, see you later.
Bye Francesca, ciao.
She's amazing, isn't she?
No, it's universal: I hate all men...
Don't judge it too rigorously...
Get some Pont-L'Evêque.
Really?
I don't like soft cheese.
In that case, get some Comté.
There.
- I'll pay by card.
- Fine.
- Let's split it.
- No, I'll get it.
No, I've got it.
You're on the cover of Télé Poche.
"Dr Morange", in prime time, and you didn't tell me?
There's nothing to say.
Let's watch it.
I'm not sure I want to.
Yes.
I've never seen an episode.
Exactly, you don't need to.
But I want to see how you tackle it.
It's not Shakespeare...
The minor works reveal the great actors.
- You don't even watch the news?
- No, too depressing.
Hello, Francesca.
Hello.
You brought oysters.
Wonderful.
They're Gillardeaus.
Put them on the table there.
Where's the aerial socket?
By the fireplace.
Let's put that over there.
Can I help?
No, it's fine.
Would you like a drink?
Yes, great.
What's that odd smell?
It's just the septic tank. I'll light a lavender candle.
I'll turn it up. Sit here, Francesca.
Be warned. It's TV, not cinema.
But there are one or two bits I'm quite pleased with.
Now, in the film, I'm guilty over the death of my wife, who I couldn't save.
There's a scene where I totally break down.
For that, I delved into some very painful, personal stuff.
It's a bit edgy. You'll see...
It's a cyst.
And the worst kind.
An epidermoid cyst on the cerebellopontine angle.
I've never seen one that big. It must weigh at least 800g.
We must operate. An epi-der-moid cyst...
- It's too risjy.
- We can't do nothing.
I remind you, you failed at this before.
Isn't once enough?
At first, she couldn't talk, then couldn't walk.
Then she went blind.
Your daughter, we'll save her, Mrs Ramirez.
That's brilliantly said.
That's greatness, there's no acting. It's fluid. Did you see that?
Remarkable.
You've no business being here!
What's going on?
I won't treat Miss Ramirez.
What?
You're giving up!
Hello?
Hi, Meynard.
No, you're not interrupting anything...
I never forgot that desert storm.
Nothing could stop you.
Béatrice was still alive, I had faith in medicine.
Do your duty, Dr Morange.
2.5 million!
That's absurd!
People are totally crazy.
Nothing special, watching "Dr Morange" with Gauthier...
Sorry, I couldn't get away. So, what happened?
The Ramirez girl is still in a coma.
Turn it off, that'll do.
No way. You can't turn it off now.
What happens to the Ramirez girl?
Yes, really, we're enjoying it.
It was a bad idea.
I love your "We'll save her, Mrs Ramirez. "
Goodnight, Francesca.
Gauthier, don't take it badly.
Come back!
Stay here with us!
That wasn't very nice.
I'm disappointed in you.
It's like you enjoyed hurting him. A little.
You're no Alceste.
Alceste is a pure, sincere man.
You toy with people.
Wait, he was the one who came to seek me out.
And you're making him pay.
You should apologize.
Apologize?
No.
- You don't want to?
- No.
- Shame.
- You're not leaving too?
Hello, doctor!
Hello, Dr Morange!
Nice strawberries. May I taste?
Be my guest.
Oh, it was great!
Last night, you were so...
- Can I have an autograph please?
- Of course.
Ah, the good Dr Morange.
Such a generous man.
Meanwhile, my mom's still waiting.
I'm sorry. I left a personal message for the professor.
I can't do any more.
Like I should believe you.
I don't care if you do or not.
There you go, you play the hero, but you don't give a shit about others.
And my mom's stuck in a wheelchair...
It's not my fault she broke her hip.
You actors, you're in your shitty little universe.
That'll do.
- What d'you mean?
- I said that'll do!
- Thanks, have a nice day.
- You too.
What happened?
I got in a fight.
This'll hurt a bit. To think that I even called Professor Delahaye...
I wanted to say, I really enjoyed last night.
I loved when you said:
"We'll save her, Mrs Ramirez. "
Yeah, sure.
- Shall we start?
- Heads or tails?
No. Today, I'm doing Alceste.
What do you mean?
Is that a problem?
My eyes are far too offended
Both court and town provoke my spleen
I fall into black humors and deep sorrow When I see men treat each other as they do I see nothing but base flattery
I cannot endure it, it maddens me, and my aim Is to break with all mankind
This wrath's too harsh
I laugh at your black moods And see in us two brothers in the school for husbands
Drop your dull comparisons No, really, have done with your pranks
The world will not change for all your meddling
Since you so admire frankness
I tell you frankly, this distemper Is seen by all as comedy
Such wrath against today's mores Makes you a laughing-stock for many
So much the better, heavens! 'Tis what I ask
It's a good sign. I'm overjoyed
I hate mankind so much, I'd be cross if I was thought mild
You have great spite for mankind
Yes, I have an unutterable...
"Frightful".
I know!
I have a frighftul hatred for it
Are all poor mortals, without exception To be included in this aversion?
There are surely some, even nowadays
No, it's universal: I hate all men
I have to say, that's phenomenal.
Phenomenal.
You've really got it.
It's fabulous.
Let me tell you:
I don't give a shit what you think.
I don't need your approval.
What mark will you give me?
14 out of 20?
17?
I'm not your student, you're not my teacher.
For five days you've been messing with me. It's over.
You never meant to do the play.
The only thing you're interested in is the power you have over people.
You like having me at your mercy.
Believe me...
I swear I don't want...
I sought you out because I admired you.
That's the truth.
But you're such a piece of shit that there's no point.
No more toying with me:
"Maybe I'll tell you tomorrow... "
It's over!
Maybe you don't need anyone. But I certainly don't need you!
Goodbye.
He got angry. It's not all over.
Yes, this time it's really the end.
He told me I could die alone.
I think you should get that vasectomy.
That's not a nice thing to say.
I'm just kidding.
In truth, I liked playing Alceste with him.
Alternating the roles... that's never been done.
You're dying to act again, but you're too proud to admit it.
Let me fix the chain.
I was an asshole.
It'd be good if you...
if we both did it.
Did what?
The play.
"The Misanthrope".
You want to, then?
I'd like to do it together.
Give me your bike.
If you like.
What do you think?
Shall we do it?
Alright, let's do it.
How's it going, boys?
Bunch of assholes!
I hate this.
- I'm fine.
Watch the brakes!
Let's go!
Let's run!
Come on!
Hello, Tamara?
It's me.
It's in the bag!
He's agreed to do it.
You can draw up the contracts.
Call Roussel and Rinieri, too.
I thought maybe you could come down this weekend. We could finalize it all. What do you think?
Yes, I'll count on you then.
See you tomorrow.
Goodbye.
I'm going to bed, then.
I can speak Italian too, you know.
I was preparing for my death scene, and I was going back over my whole life,
the most emotional moments, concentrating, ready to die. And next to me, I hear the make-up girl asking the hairdresser: "What're you having for dinner tonight?
' ...an intense mood, like at Avignon, when you play the Popes' Palace.
I was slap bang in the middle of the situation, and I say the line:
"I'd like to sit down again. "
I say it while I'm sitting.
And there's an almighty pause.
I totally blanked, I was utterly petrified.
I just wanted to die.
- I'm off.
- You're leaving?
Yes, I'm going home.
I'll come with you.
No.
Till tomorrow.
At first, I had a bad feeling about Francesca.
I was totally wrong about her.
When will the premiere be?
In September.
It'd be nice if Francesca could come, no?
Did you see her reaction when I offered the guest room?
That was a major breakthrough.
D'you think?
Better get an Alitalia loyalty card. An Alitalia card, really?
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Ms Francesca's left.
She took the early train.
I just went to Francesca's and she's gone.
How about that?
Didn't even say goodbye.
You want a coffee?
No, thanks.
I have to tell you something.
Well...
Something happened last night.
I forgot my cellphone, so I went back to Francesca's to get it.
I knocked on the door and went in.
I called out, no reply. I went upstairs.
There she was, alone in her room, crying.
She'd just spoken to her ex-husband. She was devastated.
She threw herself at me, clinging like a drowning woman.
Then what?
Then... the inevitable happened.
What do you think I care?
Listen, we're all grown-ups.
You're not mad at me?
Why would I be?
Like I fell in love in 4 days?
Yes, you're right.
Christine's about to arrive.
She won't find out.
Trust me.
Hello.
See you at St Martin?
Gauthier called last night.
He's so glad to be acting with Serge.
That's Gauthier.
Smooth as you like, but gets what he wants.
True.
Excuse me, you mean Gauthier Valence?
Yes, why?
He's crazy.
Look what he did to me.
I ask him a favor for my mom, he punches me.
- Gauthier hit you?
- Nearly broke my nose.
Jacuzzi's are meant to be powerful!
It massages the back.
Yes, but I nearly drowned.
That's so funny.
Sorry, excuse me.
I took the liberty of inviting a few friends for a drink.
Of course.
And I have a favor to ask.
Sure.
Would you mind posing for a few photos, in the house?
Long as it's not in the tub.
Ah, darling!
- Lovely to see you.
- You too.
We'll talk in just a minute.
Hello. How was the trip?
Excellent.
We'll talk in a minute over a drink.
I love this new dress.
So you punched the taxi driver?
I guess I lost it.
I like a bit of rough!
Oh yeah?
They say acting is like making love, and it's true.
Don't overdo it.
It's a certain chemistry, anyway.
You look marvelous, my dear Serge.
That's saved the production a few bucks.
- Here.
- No, I'm on water.
- What for? Let's toast!
- No, thanks.
You must be Gauthier's lady, delighted to meet you.
Thank you.
Since he's been here, he's reconciled me with acting.
You kidnapped him for a week, I wondered if he'd return.
My apologies.
Are you really a neurosurgeon?
Yes, but not as dashing as Dr Morange.
You're here, too.
If you need advising on the contract, I'm here.
Very kind. Thank you.
I'm not working during rehearsal, so no question of any shoots, OK?
But we've signed for lots of things.
- Too bad, cancel.
- Are you kidding?
We've planned for 8 weeks of rehearsal.
That's good.
Molière needs that.
What about touring?
Kept to a minimum, 4 major cities:
Lyon, Marseille, Lille, Bordeaux.
3 months in all.
Not too long.
That seems perfect.
Will you perform a bit for us?
A bit of what?
A little scene, just for the pleasure.
No.
I really don't want to.
Come on, Serge.
Heads or tails, as usual.
Heads.
Lucky me, I'm Alceste.
Up till now, I always got Philinte.
I'm not being Philinte.
- What do you mean?
- I'm playing Alceste.
You can pass on Philinte now, if you like.
But in the theater, we take turns.
No, we're not taking turns.
I play Alceste or I don't play.
What have we been doing?
I don't know.
Not my problem.
Are you backing out?
No, I'm telling you I play Alceste, period.
No way I'm playing Philinte.
Hang on, we both rehearsed each role, that's what we agreed.
Did we agree you screw the Italian?
No, but you still went and did it.
Who's this Italian?
- He's talking rubbish.
- Who is she?
- What's got into to you?
- I play Alceste.
I don't play Philinte.
I should smash your face.
The friend of mankind, the embodiment of generosity, the man who shares suffering, yet always up for a fight.
- Leave him alone!
- Get off!
Gauthier, leave him alone!
You're a real bastard!
Stop it.
Let him go!
Stay on your fucking isle!
Go squat in your septic tank!
We don't need you!
I wanted to, but this time, it's really over.
What does he say?
The times we live in are so perverse
That I must shun all company of men
The pain of it is too much to bear
Let's retire from this wild and cut-throat place
Since among mankind you live like wolves
Traitors, you won't see me among you in all my days
I'll be right there.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Leave me, pray
What strange humor is this?
Leave me, I say. Out of my sight
Can't you listen, without anger?
I want to be angry, and I will not listen
I cannot understand your bursts of temper
And though we're friends, I'm first
I, your friend?
Strike that
I may have been so until now But after what you just did I am no longer
I want no place in rotten hearts
Am I so guilty, Alceste?
Heavens, you should die for shame
'Tis inexcusable
Men of honor would be scandalized
It's a good sign. I'm overjoyed
I hate mankind so much I'd be cross if I was thought mild
You have great spite for mankind
Yes, I have an unutterable hatred...
Yes, I have a fearful hatred...
No, that's not it.
You have great spite for mankind
Yes,
I have a frighftul hatred for it
GOING AWAY
Go, sir!
It's What? 10-12?
Result?
7O times 90?
Remember what we did yesterday. 70...
Very good. Think hard. 7 times 9...
- 7 times 9?
- 63.
- What?
- 63.
Then what do you do?
Don't help him.
That's right.
Next one, listen carefully.
Baptiste, I wanted to see you.
- Delmas is due back in September.
- He's better?
Won't you stay?
I'd like to open a third class. We have too many pupils.
No, I'm not staying.
You prefer supply teaching?
Yes, I do.
You never feel like getting to know us better?
We'll have a goodbye drink. You'll come?
Thank you.
Finished?
Draw the median from point A.
Remember what a median is?
In an isosceles, what is it?
A symmetrical axis?
But it's too late now. We'll do it on Tuesday.
Is someone fetching you?
My dad.
See you on Tuesday.
- Going away?
- No.
- Enjoy the long weekend.
- You too.
Mr Scaffone, I'll be moving out on July 3rd.
One item of furniture is mine.
We can do the inventory any Wednesday you want.
Thank you.
Mathias...
Did you call your dad?
There's no reply.
I'll come too.
What are you doing here?
Hello.
I teach at the school. Mathias is in my class.
Isn't it your weekend at Mrs Cordier's?
That's next week.
What are you talking about?
That's crazy.
Mrs Cordier?
Hello.
Weren't you having Mathias today?
I must have noted the wrong date.
Thank you.
My mistake...
What'll I do with you?
I have to take that Ferrari to Monaco.
Bye, Mathias.
Don't go. Come up for a minute, please.
Go inside, you.
Have a drink with us. What's your poison?
- I'm OK, thanks.
- Sure?
Is he doing OK?
Study hard.
I got him a map that shows all the rivers in France.
Fetch the map to show your teacher.
I haven't been to see you. But we've met, right?
You gave me a ride from Montpellier. I was hitching in the rain.
That's right.
I'd been at a symposium.
- Wasn't it on... astrophysics?
- It was.
You never said you were a teacher.
Thanks for bringing him.
- Get the map. Go on!
- Pain in the ass...
Kids aren't always easy. But you know that.
Just a second...
Try obeying for once.
Chill.
Chill?
No way.
How can you find anything here?
Tidy up, will you?
Look at this mess!
My aunt was a teacher too.
She was strict.
We'll take him with us.
Mr Contrary, get your bag.
Sick of it!
What's up?
He has a mother, right?
I got it wrong. He's here now.
Like every week.
I can stay here.
Yeah, sure, of course.
We'll manage.
Thanks for everything.
Get your laundry, it'll be dry.
Hurry it up, will you?
I can look after him tonight.
No, I can't ask you to...
Don't you have family to see for Whitsun?
No, I'm free.
We'll be back Sunday. He has my number. Give me yours.
I'll give you 3O euros for dinner...
It's OK.
It's awesome when I can watch them.
He took me to a motocross race once.
A championship race.
You don't like anchovies?
Where were you born?
In Guadeloupe, at Saint-Gilles.
- May I?
- Yes.
I was too young to remember.
My parents had jobs there.
Where were you born?
Not far away. In southwest France.
- Hi, Selim.
- Wassup?
Here's your Pacino DVD.
He's wild.
Your kid brother?
See you.
Next year, I'll go to live in Arles with my mum.
The switch is here. Don't stay up too late.
You play basketball well.
You think so?
I learned on a campus in the States.
You taught there?
Go to sleep now.
Can we go to the beach tomorrow?
I'm not your chauffeur, pal.
Go to sleep.
- OK back there?
- Yeah!
Can't we go faster?
It's not a race. Look at the scenery.
Let's stay here and go for a swim.
No, further on.
There's another beach. It's better.
What?
Jos? !
Can you give me a towel, please?
Look, Johnny Hallyday on his yacht. Look.
Sorry, it's Carla Bruni.
Stupid...
She'd believe anything.
- My little sister...
- Yeah?
No, she's not my sister.
- Your wife did that?
- She's tough.
You're blushing!
- The lemon tart's good.
- He makes a good one.
Why do they live like that and not us?
You'll never find an answer to that.
Working Monday too, Sandra?
I asked Balou. He won't pay a euro more.
He says I get tips.
He's so cheap now.
He wasn't like that before.
Being manager's gone to his head.
He's raking it in. He's on commission.
Sandra, someone's asking for you.
- Who?
- I don't know.
Come on.
What is it, Mathias?
Why are you here?
Come here.
I work too hard to visit him.
M? ribel was fun.
Yeah, it was fun.
You went skiing?
No, sledding.
I worked the winter season.
Yaw" QrQWm
Patrick didn't pick him up from school.
Your dad's OK. I got the apartment in Arles.
Look.
I get it in September. 600 square feet.
Beautiful!
- Good neighbourhood?
- Residential.
How's he doing at school?
He tries.
He'll go to middle school in Arles.
It's Baptiste, right?
He'll go to middle school.
I look after him there.
I've done Mauritius, M? ribel and here.
Sandra!
I have to work. What'll I do with you?
- You have to get back?
- Yes.
- You want to stay?
- Yes.
Can you take him back?
Sundays are hell here.
Go for a swim. I have a cottage nearby. I'll give you sunbeds.
Lili can do what she wants.
Take a look, Balou.
What?
My friend's designs...
This will sell.
They're star signs.
Embroidered.
We could put them in the store.
Look.
What do you think?
Come here.
Come on.
We've had an email.
It's addressed to you.
What is this?
The restaurant?
How much d'you owe?
You know I can't help, right?
I'm late. I had to shop with Balou.
We were out of wine.
Take a big towel.
Here.
I'm OK.
Does the TV work?
Of course it does.
I'm beat.
I'm too old for days this long.
Sorry to take up your time.
It's OK.
We swam, played darts and cards...
So you work seasons?
I was born into it.
My folks had a food truck.
They made pizzas, pancakes...
I used to work 3 months, then travel.
That was before Mathias.
You shouldn't have kids living this life.
How did you get into teaching?
I work seasons too.
It's how my teaching contract works. A term or two in one place, then I move on.
So you're what?
A sort of temp?
Something like that.
Why not stay longer?
No idea. I guess I'm used to it now.
The freedom.
Yeah, it's funny...
You move, you meet new people. But you lose the others.
Duckling...
Your teacher's nice. Did you thank him?
No.
You're going to.
I'll be going now.
Really?
Call his dad to say he's staying here.
Let's do lunch tomorrow.
I'll just do the prep at the beach.
You're not going back now?
Hey, babe, come on!
Let me get changed.
- Move it!
- For fuck's sake!
She's a handful.
Lili, did the trattoria guy pay in the end?
He signed.
Talk about a slate.
He makes me laugh.
Sure...
Coming out?
No, my kid's here.
You remember you have a kid now?
The kid's been hauled around for years.
That'll change. I have an apartment.
Why am I telling you?
I know what I need to do.
You're a hard one to follow.
I've paid your debts once. I won't again.
You hear me, Sandra?
I've made up the bed. It won't be too uncomfortable.
Some men came looking for you.
TWO guys...
One with long hair.
You didn't say where I worked?
No, I didn't tell them anything.
I'm not sleepy.
It must be the nervous tension...
You sleepy?
Two whiskies.
No, I don't drink.
Pain in the ass. It's against your religion?
I hate drinking alone.
Two.
I like people who can have fun.
I'll be right back.
Ever answer your phone?
- I've lost it.
- Lost it?
We had no news so what can we do?
What's going on?
You're working on beaches here?
What happened to St Barth?
I opened the place. I transferred it.
The recession was starting...
The bank refused to cover for me.
I had no more leeway, no more credit.
I came back broke. My stepdad paid for my flight.
So where's our money?
Go there and negotiate the license.
Cathy's still there.
You'll pay for business class?
I'll call Cathy.
Give us your new number.
Come on!
I'm thirsty now.
You guys are no fun.
I did the design for the place. In dark blue.
With the constellations, parrots...
it wasn't bad at all.
Can you get two more?
I need sugar.
Are you OK?
- Recognise me?
- No.
Right, we've never met.
OK... But at some point... people recognise each other.
That's how love begins.
The attraction...
I'm not alone, OK.
Thanks, pal.
What was I saying?
Go back to your table.
Listen...
Who are you, kid?
Here... Get yourself a drink at the bar... and stay there.
Stop!
Cut it out!
Get outta here!
Call the cops!
Give me his jacket!
I'll pay tomorrow.
Bitch!
Shut your mouth!
What the hell are you doing?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Come on, will you?
Are you OK?
What's wrong?
Tell me.
Can I borrow a shirt and jeans?
Sure.
What's up?
Playing mummy?
What's going on?
When'll you look after your son, dammit?
If you knew how to care for a kid, we'd know.
I like that shirt. Its home's here!
Go on, play.
I got some clothes for you.
PSYCHIATRIST
Watch this, Mum!
I slept two hours. I must look terrible.
When did we turn in?
Late.
Don't you remember anything?
Just moments.
Good.
You don't know your strength.
There are lots of bookings but I'll try to get free.
You have to get to your dad's.
Tell him we'll be back later.
You call him then.
No, not me.
Voicemail.
Patrick, it's Sandra.
It's OK, Mathias is with me. I'll keep him this weekend.
Bye.
That suit you?
I'm going to be late.
- You OK?
- I didn't sleep.
Jos?
...
Can you groom the sand out front?
Guys, I don't need this now.
We'll be back Thursday.
Work it out.
A trickster?
Cheeky.
So he's also a bit...
- Impish.
- The others?
Mischievy.
- What?
- Dreamy.
What was that?
Misch...
Mischievy.
Read carefully what it says.
Mischievish...
Mischievous.
Mischievous rhymes with joyous. And fractious too.
- What's up?
- Can you take him back?
I have to...
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
I fell.
Don't just sit there staring!
Get lost!
What?
I owe money.
I borrowed a year ago to start an Asian fast-food joint in St Barth...
I screwed it all up.
I'm made for business the way you are for drink.
If you were threatened, call the police.
Like when you wrecked that guy?
Take him back to his dad.
Patrick's not much but he's a father.
He has an address.
I'm off to Barcelona tonight.
Why?
Got 50,000 euros on you?
I haven't.
I know a guy there. They won't find me.
What do you want?
Get outta here!
This is my place. You're dumping us?
They messed you up. Who were they?
You said it was settled.
I forgot something, OK!
Give me the 500 you owe me.
I'm splitting.
I'm firing you!
Take your stuff and get the hell out!
I'll get me a new tenant.
See you, kid.
Want a fingerbowl?
Can you work at my school in Arles?
I don't teach middle school.
But you change all the time.
Show him the apartment.
There's no signal here.
It's near tennis courts. They're lit up all night.
Will we have a room each?
Yes.
- You haven't finished.
- I have.
1O years living out of a suitcase...
What is it with me and money?
I'm sick of it.
Are you happy?
You make what... 1,400 a month?
Happy with that?
Yes, I am.
I'm not.
So I dream. But it doesn't work. I founder.
I'll call from Spain.
Hello?
I'll P33'-
- Excuse me...
- I paid.
You shouldn't have.
I'll make no promises.
What do you mean?
Promise me what?
We're leaving.
Mathias!
Where do I go?
What did you say?
The B? ziers exit?
Yes.
You're sure you're expected?
They're people he knows?
Yes.
Here!
C' men , Mum'.!
Go!
19 seconds 3 tenths.
I need to work on it.
My best time used to be 15.
Good evening.
Pump number 4.
Can I get this?
Why has Baptiste bought a jacket?
All set.
Drive.
What are you doing?
Washing stuff.
I didn't bring anything.
Baptiste...
You haven't eaten?
Why would they give you the money?
They owe it to me.
The stuff you're making me do...
What am I making you do?
I'm like a little old man of 90.
I'm lost outside of my usual frame.
We need to rest now.
Think I'm a bad mother?
No.
I love you because you're sad.
Shall I come back for you?
Wait here. I won't be long.
Sir?
Hello.
What are you doing?
I didn't hear the bell.
I'm Baptiste Cambi? re.
You're the...
Sorry, I've only been here 2 years.
Is Victoria here?
No, Victoria has gone back to Spain.
My wife is the cook now.
Sabine...
Everyone's here for Whitsun.
Shall I say you're here?
No.
Whitsun, crayfish... Exactly.
6 kilos. 3 boxes of them.
Baptiste...
Mother!
I'll be damned!
How are you?
He's alive!
Come on.
He's my brother.
We haven't seen him in ages.
We're back in favour?
They came from London with me.
Where's Mother?
She was just here.
Mother!
Welcome.
You were just passing by?
Boys, don't run near the house.
You don't know them.
Say hello to your uncle.
I'll go and shower.
He's happy deep down. A drink?
Juice, if you have any.
How did you get here?
With a girlfriend.
- Where is she?
- Outside.
Go and get her.
Juice, for Baptiste the Rebel.
Seen Emmanuelle?
No, I just got here.
Emmanuelle!
Your favourite brother's back!
Check the cars.
Too bad Dad isn't here.
Yeah, too bad. Your dad's in Monaco.
He had a red one like that.
Do you like Porsches, Mom?
I had a pal who had one.
We did controlled skids in the Pyrenees.
Are you hungry?
Yeah.
Who are his family?
Are they rich?
It looks like it.
I thank God for letting me live to see this moment.
I couldn't find you.
I gave up the master bedroom. This one suits me better.
Sit down.
You were always too tall.
When I saw you just now, I thought it was your father. When I first met him.
Are you well, Mother?
Better.
I saw you've had the roof redone.
You noticed that?
I've aged, haven't I?
I was ill this winter.
I have to swim. So we had the pool renovated.
Swimming bores me.
You know, when people ask me about you, I say you live in Sweden and that stops the questions.
In Sweden?
It's what I came up with.
But what hurts me is that you gave Madeleine news and not us.
Such a distant cousin, we never saw her.
Precisely.
I met her by chance in Lyon.
She told everyone about it.
Are you happy?
One hears that teaching is so hard in France.
I've been lucky with the jobs I've had.
Is that corduroy?
Will you stay for lunch?
Sundays can be tiring with the kids running and shouting.
The parents won't control them.
- It's him.
- Stop it.
He suffered when he died, you know.
But I was cowardly.
I need money.
That's why you're here...
I need 50,000 euros.
I don't know. You'll need to talk to Gilles. He deals with all that.
Ask Gilles. He's the one.
Hello, Baptiste.
Hello.
You have a friend waiting?
I can fetch her.
Good idea.
Fetch your friend.
We'll add a place setting.
You'll stay for lunch. That's settled.
Fetch his friend, Emmanuelle.
Her name's Sandra.
She has a child.
- Yours?
- No.
Put the tables outside.
You can add 1O places on the sand to the left.
No, I'm not coming back.
I'll call from Spain.
I'm a mess.
Gotta go. Bye.
Hello.
Were you with my brother yesterday?
Yes.
I thought it was him.
Sometimes I imagine I see him.
Where did you sleep?
A couple of miles away.
We have 1O bedrooms.
Will you have lunch with us?
We'll grab a bite somewhere.
Hi.
What's your name?
Mathias!
He asked me to fetch you.
I'll ride with you.
What is this shit?
I'll introduce you to some new friends.
- She wanted us to come.
- That's good.
Sure this is a good day?
There are 12 of us.
I feel ugly, badly dressed...
I feel ignorant.
They're the ignorant ones.
I don't want to eat with them.
- Eat with us.
- With you.
Wash your hands.
We're having crayfish.
I'll take him.
Where are you from?
Whose child is that?
Across the Garonne?
Yes.
Our father bought them...
How long ago?
It's half an hour on foot?
Do the grounds run to the road?
No, further.
To the Raisin? woods.
We're selling a field there.
Where do you live?
With his dad in Le Vigan.
- A village?
- A small town.
Mathias is my pupil.
I'm a schoolteacher.
Sandra, you live in...
I'm in catering.
Remember my brother?
Espinosa.
Jean-Pierre.
From Higher Maths.
Yes, I remember him very well.
You were ahead of him.
He spoke a lot about you.
You met up in Paris, right?
On the university's top rowing team.
I forget now.
- How is he?
- Well.
I'll tell him I saw you.
He's at Stanford for a master's in aeronautics. Did you know?
No.
You didn't want to carry on?
No.
- You dropped everything?
- Yes.
With such promise?
Baptiste noticed we've redone the roof. As one of the best...
Can you shut your woman up?
It was his decision.
It wasn't like that.
I didn't understand what I was doing anymore.
I'd become stupid. I'd hand in blank pages.
It had become absurd.
Physics, aeronautics, rowing...
I was judged to be a disappointment. A guilty secret.
So a family meeting was held... And they had me committed.
For how long?
7 months and 25 days. A long time.
Yes, a long time.
Thomas, your friends are bored.
After that, I was allowed out.
I could go to buy cigarettes, newspapers...
There's a race in the next village.
People from all over.
Interested?
This is the first time that Baptiste has been back to this house.
This is a big event for us.
Thank you for bringing him back to us.
Where do you work?
On the beach. In Maguelone.
Gilles will get beaten.
Like on Sundays...
Emmanuelle!
Thanks.
Want it in the living room?
No...
That's kind of you.
The cr? me anglaise was good.
Was there vanilla in it?
I don't know. We have it delivered.
They don't care about organic here.
So you're in catering?
My brother has a restaurant in Mont-de-Marsan.
Look at this thing...
Lend me a hand?
Thanks.
I can do the silver if you want.
We've relocated the company.
We sold the Toulouse offices to move to Labastide-Beauvoir.
Thomas runs a new production site in Scotland.
We should be listed on the stock market within 2 years.
If you read the notary's letter, you know 15% of all that is yours.
So I can advance you 50,000 euros.
Contact the trust officer and he'll explain how you earn the dividends.
That's right, pal.
Get used to it, you're rich.
There's real estate in Marseilles but we sold the woods here. The trees were sick. Dad wanted that.
Why bury him in Carcassonne?
That was what he wanted. To be near his mother.
We waited for you.
Yes.
You couldn't make it?
Don't say you all missed me.
We thought you were still angry with us.
You're divorced then?
The ten-year hurdle.
Give me the money later.
Where are you going?
Give your nephews dictation. They need it.
When do we leave?
Not having fun with them?
They're all cousins.
They have bedrooms.
They're all staying here.
Did you call dad?
What does "committed" mean?
When someone's freedom is taken away.
- We have to go.
- Thank you, Liliane.
Come back soon.
Thank you for a lovely day.
See you soon.
Goodbye. Kiss the children for me.
They've pinched my hairdryer.
Surely he doesn't love Baptiste like a father?
What?
We'll serve a warm consomm? at 7.
Sorry. My son has school tomorrow.
Mine too then.
He must be a good teacher.
Yes.
We only met recently.
You're very pretty, Sandra.
You have a lovely figure.
So you don't have custody of Mathias...
I'm having him back.
I had four children without really knowing why.
My husband wanted that many.
The family, his sons...
Above all Baptiste.
You have just one child.
Take care of him.
Did you visit him while he was committed?
Yes.
Only I did.
What could we do?
I don't know if we were right.
My husband could be violent.
It was no fun going there.
It was far from Toulouse.
The back of beyond. St Jean de Chalosse.
He'd sit watching sitcoms with other inmates.
Then, one Sunday, he left.
Is it Sunday today?
We left him. He lived on the streets. And then... at one point, I told myself he was dead.
It was as if he was dead.
Some parents have dead children, don't they?
Baptiste!
Leave me alone!
Baptiste!
Come home right now!
Just look at yourself!
Look at you!
You stink!
Leave me alone!
Leave me be!
I thought you'd killed him.
He should have left me alone.
That's not what makes me angry.
Not one letter.
Never any news.
I thought of you every day.
I'm here.
Too late.
Who are those two with you?
Are they so interesting?
Mother wants us all in the study.
You don't have to come. But you do.
You need money.
Are these all my schools?
You stopped at Roanne.
That was the year he died.
He did the map with me.
We followed you.
It's me.
Where are you?
This house is so big...
It's ages since I spoke to you.
Yeah.
Yes.
- Lemonade?
- Mine's all gone.
Don't get it everywhere.
Thank you.
Sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Franklin.
For you.
They're at the airport.
There's a 3-hour wait for London.
They arrive at Gatwick at midnight, then 3O miles to the city centre.
I think it's all there.
Call it an advance on what I mentioned.
No. I don't want the rest.
You don't want it?
Is Baptiste here?
Why's that child still around?
Let me get this right...
You don't want your share?
No.
You just want to travel from town to town as a supply teacher?
Yes. Why not?
Teaching others who know nothing yet, is that contemptible?
Yes, I can stay a teacher or go back to astrophysics or open a chip van...
What do you care?
That's a waste of life!
I should've left with the others.
What's your life?
A hotel room?
A bank?
I'll keep on making money. So screw you!
No one refuses an inheritance!
Is it a pose?
Who do you think you are?
You're no saint. You're not a terrorist.
You're surprised?
You were born here too.
It's a phase.
You want to preach to us?
Humiliate us?
He should've stayed in the nuthouse.
Since he says he's happy...
Your place is here, Baptiste.
We made mistakes. All of us.
That's behind us now.
You have to stay.
No, Mother.
It took me too long to be elsewhere.
With what you know, what you've studied, you could do so much!
And that woman... What is she?
I've talked to her. She's endearing.
You've helped her. You were right to.
But don't tell me your life is with her.
I won't believe you.
Thanks.
Baptiste, wait.
You can do what you want with money.
All it takes is imagination.
It won't burn your fingers.
You can't know how you'll feel, who you'll be, in 5 years, in 1 O years.
Do you PFW?
Badly.
There's a stream back there. I thought there was a spring.
It's beautiful here.
I won't come back.
The spring's further away.
I've wrecked my sandals.
You'll never have seen me well dressed.
I've had a nice day.
And you?
I have what you need.
Would you like to be rich?
I refused something you might have liked.
If I'd run after money, I wouldn't be where I am now.
The Porsche is leaving.
They've served the consomm? .
I spent so much time in these woods.
Shall we leave?
I hate driving at night.
What's up, you layabout?
Where were you?
You're here?
I'll finish the month.
Make me a coffee?
You decided that alone?
Yeah. What would you do without me?
Those two guys never came back.
Is this mine?
Yes, it's yours.
Let them come.
Any bookings?
Not a lot.
Where were you?
What happened?
I've met a guy.
Put the cutlery on the napkins to hold them down.
Previously on NCIS...
No kiss for your father?
What are you doing here?
Arash Kazmi is Eli's new VEVAK contemporary.
Kazmi's first visit to the U.S., Eli just happens to be here.
How could Eli be dead?
I was the one who approached him about forging peace to begin with.
What are you not telling me, Tom?
CIA took out Kazmi that night.
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, you've manipulated evidence and you've obstructed justice.
Overnight delivery, left him on the front porch.
Label says it was shipped from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Meet Navy SEAL Lieutenant Chad McBride.
I have got thousands of documents ready to indict Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
Parsons, you should know that Gibbs' team handed in their resignations.
Tom Morrow may have a solve. We pull it off, this could all go away.
Where's Gibbs?
On a mission for JSOC.
Gibbs, do it.
Sir, I need a moment.
Richard, go home.
I figured you'd be drowning your sorrows by now.
Well, I know that Secretary Jarvis is inside, and I would like five minutes with the both of you to discuss NCIS.
This is not the place.
My job was to clean up the Navy's investigative branch.
And I've been sidelined by some half-assed classified mission because you guys want Gibbs to play cowboy.
Homeland is not the only agency authorizing this.
Secretary Jarvis, the Director of the CIA both agree the mission takes precedence.
But my case was a political slam dunk.
Gibbs is being given a "get out of jail free" card.
It's wrong.
What's wrong is me continuing this conversation for one more minute.
Gibbs has a job to do. Your tunnel-visioned, stubborn determination is getting in the way.
Well, at least tell me, what is so important that one assignment can trump a career of rule breaking?
The less you know, the better.
And believe me, I'm doing you a favor.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
There's a line in the sand, Parsons.
Don't cross it.
♪ NCIS 11x01 ♪ Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Original air date on September 24, 2013
This is so weird.
"Weird" is but one of the many adjectives I could apply to these circumstances, Mr. Palmer.
If only that creep Parsons wasn't pushing his witch hunt, none of this would've happened.
That creep, as you call him, Abby, did not bomb the hotel ballroom. Yeah, but Gibbs and the others, they would've still been here and maybe they could've stopped this.
Yeah, well, we have a long night ahead of us.
I didn't know the SECNAV, but I heard he was married. - Had kids.
- Yeah. He and Director Vance were really close.
Why didn't we do more to stop Parson's investigation?
Like a sit-in or a... or a hunger strike.
Yeah, I'm no good at hunger strikes. I get really light-headed around 4:00 if I don't have a snack.
What we must do is to stop feeling sorry for ourselves.
There's work to do, and right now, those responsible have the upper hand.
Secretary Jarvis and those who have fallen are counting on us.
Gibbs, you're here.
Unless I'm seeing things.
You guys got work to do?
Yes, we do, Jethro.
And we are eager to do it.
Shall we?
Thank you.
That was the Secretary of Defense.
In addition to Jarvis's death, Tom Morrow was just rushed into surgery.
He may lose a leg.
Anyone claiming responsibility yet?
The Secretary of the U.S. Navy is dead, Captain.
I don't believe anybody would be fool enough to welcome that death wish.
Response?
The White House wants answers by any means necessary.
Intel thinks this is just a warning shot across the bow.
That the main event is still to come.
It's something to look forward to.
Gibbs, this may also be related to Navy Lieutenant McBride's murder.
We believe the lieutenant got too close to indentifying a new terror cell.
Combine the bomb tonight and McBride's radioactive remains, it's...
What can I do?
JSOC will be handling its own investigation.
But nobody would suspect your involvement while you're under close D.O.D. scrutiny.
McBride's mission originated in Iran.
Finding his killer would be a start.
We have an informant in Abyaneh.
I can try reaching out.
Nobody's forcing you to do this, Gibbs.
Doing my job, Director.
Tony?
Tony, wake up.
Tony?
Ziva?
Damn it.
You didn't miss me.
I'm right here.
So much for a face-to-face.
"Thinking."
That's dangerous.
This is good.
I know you like surprises.
Delilah, hey.
I'm, uh, still recovering from last night's surprise.
I should be at work.
I can help.
Tim, you can't.
Not until you're reinstated.
Yeah, but this isn't right.
There's agents working around the clock.
Maybe I should call Vance.
Maybe Tony's heard something.
Look. I could get into a lot of trouble for telling you this.
But...
But what?
More than one source of intel says the device used wasn't Middle Eastern.
It was American.
Single individual or group?
I don't know.
I need to go.
You don't even have a badge.
I-I can... at least talk to Abby.
Okay, McGee, let's talk.
Abby. Hey.
You've met Delilah, right?
Yes.
Hi.
Uh, you want a coffee, espresso?
So, McGee, I came down here after last night's horror show to make sure you're okay.
I had a feeling that you wouldn't come in.
Well, Abby, I'm not an agent anymore.
You'll always be an agent, McGee.
I also wanted to tell you that Gibbs is headed out of town.
Out of town where?
Um... can she be trusted?
I have a higher security clearance than any of you.
So did Mata Hari.
Abby.
Okay, um... well, I'm gonna go back to work.
Um, I've got a ton of evidence from last night to go through.
Uh, but it was... mm, nice to... to see you both or...
Awkward.
Where would Gibbs be going?
I was on my way to work, thought I'd stop by before you left.
You don't drive this way to work, Leon.
President said he'd be calling Clayton's wife this morning.
I wanted to get there first.
Jarvis did the job proud.
He was a good boss.
Better friend.
Gibbs, I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.
Drive to school, Leon.
Go hug your kids.
I'm concerned about your trip.
After what happened to SECNAV, I'm tempted to ground you.
After what happened to SECNAV... how can I stay?
Captain Wayne's informant knows you're coming.
There's a C-130 fueled, standing by.
You want anything from the Tehran gift shop?
You watch your six.
Bebakhshid.
Gibbs, get in!
Come on!
What are you doing here?
I had miles that were about to expire.
These friends of yours?
Till my money runs out.
I knew when they got Jarvis, you were next.
I wanted to call first, but the phones aren't safe. Nothing is.
Where are we going?
Next village over.
Call me crazy, but I think you broke your cover.
You're in danger, Gibbs.
I came to save your life.
Your informant didn't show.
It surprise you?
No.
Well, it certainly reinforces my theory.
Your team knows too much.
About what?
Eli David and Arash Kazmi's death.
Nothing rattles cages more than a couple of well-timed assassinations.
Everybody has something to talk about.
How do you fit in?
If you're involved, I know about it.
To a fault.
You got to keep in mind, I know my way around D.C. politics, but this is different.
The players are different. And I'm positive that NCIS is being set up.
Sending you out here was not about Lieutenant McBride.
It was about separating you from your team.
I reached out to one of Lieutenant McBride's coworkers,
JSOC in Iraq, a Lieutenant Kagen.
I think we both might be interested in what he has to say.
I don't get you.
I watched people die in that hotel.
If I've learned one thing, Gibbs, it's that sometimes people do the wrong thing for the right reason.
Speak for yourself.
I am.
They were all out of apple fritters, Mr. Palmer, so you have to make do with this.
It's a bear claw.
Where's Mr. Palmer?
Who are you?
! This room is for authorized personnel only.
So unless I see some credentials, I must insist...
Who are you? !
Call security!
Who needs security?
Tie him up.
Sure, I knew McBride.
We worked together on a few ops.
He's a good guy. How's he doing?
McBride's dead, Lieutenant.
You already knew that.
It's classified, sir.
I'm not supposed to say anything.
I heard he died, but what happened?
Was hoping you could tell us.
I'm sorry. I don't follow.
His last assignment-- how long was he here?
24 hours, tops.
It's not a lot of time.
Well, his mission was cancelled. He got orders to return stateside.
He was jazzed; he wanted to get back to his wife.
We all got family back home.
You see McBride board the plane to go home, Lieutenant?
No, sir. Just grabbed his gear and got his own ride back to the airfield.
Why?
All right, Kate, listen up.
The little girl down the hall's gonna feed you while I'm gone.
Maybe I'll bring you something back from Israel.
Don't give me the fish eye.
I know what I'm doing. Well, maybe it's not the brightest idea, but we're not coworkers anymore, so all bets are off.
Where's that taxi?
Little impatient, aren't we?
I appreciate it, sir, but there are rules about drinking on the job.
New badge, new rules.
Need you to lay low till we get a handle on this.
Well, I was just hanging out in my apartment. I can't lay a lot lower than that.
And you never saw the shooter?
Well, I was pretty busy trying to keep my brain matter intact.
And you were on your way to the airport.
Personal trip.
To Israel?
I'll travel for good hummus.
Does Agent David know you've been delayed?
She does.
I also told McGee to keep his eyes open.
We have a man in Interrogation.
Dr. Mallard found him sniffing around, knocked him out. Ducky did?
Mm-hmm. K.O. with a full ten-count.
Finish your drink, Agent DiNozzo.
I'll have somebody come get you as soon as your protection detail is ready.
Sir, instead of wasting Dorneget's time, what if I just hang around here as a visitor, doing purely "visiting" things?
We could use the company.
I must say, our victim appears markedly smaller than he did when Mr. Palmer and I pummeled him into next week.
Today we met danger head-on, Anthony, and emerged victorious.
Is it me, or does standing here on the sidelines feel like...
Torture.
I thought Vance said he was headed straight in.
I'd like a few minutes with this clown.
Warm him up.
Without a badge?
I'm starting to miss that thing.
Building security has you signed in as Victor Cheng, former computer specialist with the FBI.
Is that true?
Money's better in the private sector.
You were fired from the Bureau. And yet someone granted you access to my building.
Why?
I got a call.
There's an NCIS I.D. and 20K waiting in an envelope if I sneak in here to access your database.
Details about the shrapnel taken from SECNAV.
I couldn't access it remotely because, uh, some guy named McGee built a firewall.
Guess you agent types are smarter than you look.
Who do you work for? !
I told you, I-I don't know.
Koreans?
The Chinese?
I need an answer!
What is it?
I'll be right there.
Leon!
I made a new friend along the way.
Enemies closer, Gibbs?
Well, Parsons is working for us now.
Well, do tell.
There was no mission.
Lieutenant Chad McBride was sent to Iran as a decoy.
Director Vance, we believe McBride returned to the United States.
But not just his head, all of him.
Alive. Someone wanted to make it look like the Iranians were responsible?
Leon, I know you're shorthanded, but we need you to connect the dots.
All right, I'll get Miss Sciuto on it. See if we can pinpoint where McBride was killed.
We're on the next transport home.
Parsons, too?
What do you want me to do, leave him here?
Stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!
Ziva?
What, are you taking your frustrations out on a poor little keyb...?
You're not her.
Uh, no, sir. I am Murray.
Uh, it's nice to meet you, former Agent DiNozzo.
He's the new I.T. guy.
He works with Kevin.
This is a very weird dream.
You're wide awake, Tony, and you're just in time to see the second string in full effect.
Excuse me?
Well, I suppose there are other people that would technically be considered more of a second string, but Murray just joined the I.T. department, and I took the liberty of mastering the clicker.
Wow. Show me what you got, autopsy gremlin.
Murray managed to confirm the intruder's... story.
"Victor Cheng was recently fired from the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
Nice typeface. He already told us that.
I know. But thanks to Murray, we know exactly when and why.
Go.
Uh, 2010, uh, Cheng was caught moonlighting as a hack for hire. I am currently trying to find out who gave him an NCIS I.D.
Hold on.
Are you not using contractions?
Pardon?
All right, what else?
Someone has been trying to crack NCIS's private files from the outside.
I don't like the swirly font!
I can read, Palmer.
Whoever they are already accessed our cell phone data.
Which files were compromised?
Looks like they were mostly after former personnel.
Get me coffee.
Tony, hey. I'm heading over to NCIS.
Where are you?
I'm already here, Tim. I spent the night.
Huh.
Just like old times, huh? Listen, they're tracking your cell.
Ditch it, get a cab.
Copy that.
Oh!
McGee, get in the car! Agent Fornell, this isn't about your ex-wife again, is it?
Just get in the damn car.
We got him. We're on our way.
A hell of a place for a meeting.
Who lives like this, Martha Stewart?
Well, the towels are Martha.
That's it.
Tony, what happened?
Tim, I decided to remodel. I'm going mid-century mob hit.
Gibbs walked into a trap.
DiNozzo almost got killed.
Special Agent Fornell has offered to enlighten us on recent events.
You ever hear of a terrorist wack-job named Benham Parsa?
What kind of name is Benham Parsa?
He's a young extremist.
He just claimed responsibility for killing SECNAV.
Parsa is the son of slain parents from Karachi, Pakistan.
He's still a kid.
He's ticked off.
No fear. Scary because he really doesn't give a damn.
Parsa started a new terror cell.
About a year ago, we got wind that he was brokering private business deals between terrorists and U.S. companies.
What kind of deals?
Well, every year, billions are spent rebuilding damage done by criminal acts.
Blow something up, boost the economy.
More jobs in construction, security even.
And who is Parsa reaching out to to help make these deals?
A handful of American business types.
Traitors.
MBAs and bad guys working together.
We're all searching for names.
Planned destruction can close some very, very sweet deals.
Somebody's got to rebuild.
Gordon Gekko meets bin Laden.
Why target NCIS?
Because they don't think you'll play ball.
They're right.
Does Homeland know about this?
From day one, Director.
Leon, come in.
Did you hear?
I'm keeping my leg.
Tell me you didn't know anything about Benham Parsa.
It's all tragic, reprehensible.
So you knew about the business deals?
There's no proof of any transactions.
It's all hearsay. There's nothing to link anyone to anything.
Tom, tell me you didn't set this whole thing in motion.
For heaven's sakes, Leon, look at me.
I've dedicated my life to this country.
I know the lines get blurred sometimes, but I... I would never condone an attack.
There's a lot of money in play.
How dare you make that accusation.
Somebody's trying to wipe out my team!
They tried to kill me, too!
Tom, tell me right now... who's their next target?
It's Ziva David.
Eli knew too much; they think she does, too.
I just sent a secure e-mail to Mossad in case Ziva shows up there.
How do we know the terror cell isn't monitoring everything we send?
We don't. Assume it's all been compromised.
Knowing Ziva, she'll still go under.
She has to.
Well, well.
How was the desert? They say it's a dry heat.
Welcome back, boss.
What do we got?
The usual. World went to hell while you were gone.
I've got sniper slugs in my living room, and the Duck man found a rat in his lab, and, uh, there's a terrorist named Parsa who...
Yeah, I know all that, DiNozzo.
Of course you do.
What don't you know?
Where's Ziva? Israel. Off the grid for now.
I'm trying to establish a protected e-mail account so we can communicate securely overseas.
Yeah.
He's okay.
Working with us now.
It's nice to see that you guys are alive and well.
Look, I'm sorry about the, uh...
I want my badge back.
Yeah, I can understand that.
Not a problem.
Now that the case is, uh, dismissed,
I'll talk with Director Vance about it.
Thank you, Dick.
So, what'd you find out about the Iranian head games?
Lieutenant wasn't killed in Iran. Uh, yeah.
We, uh, we found out that Lieutenant McBride was given orders redirecting him to the United States, and he walked into a trap.
His head was mailed to his house via a Middle Eastern detour.
And toss in a little radioactivity...
I'm so glad that you're here.
Someone went to great lengths to make it look like Iran was responsible for this.
So who actually killed him?
Same people who want us dead.
Local cell.
Guns for hire.
Find them.
I don't care if you're dirty or sweaty or tired or you smell like the inside of a cargo plane.
Abbs, yeah, but I do. Come on. Results of Lieutenant McBride's head.
Gibbs, look out!
It was getting a little uncomfortable in the squad room.
But I can see it's not much better down here.
Nerve of that creep. He just thinks he can... he can go anywhere and...
Abby.
Yes?
Test results.
They're in the other room.
Yeah. And?
And he is in the other room.
And unless something has changed, I am not going in there with him.
I mean, something would have to have drastically changed.
Like if he saved my life?
Yeah. Like that's gonna happen.
Yeah.
I mean, if he did, then of course I'm glad, but, I mean, he hasn't redeemed himself, has he?
Fine. But I still don't like him.
Thank you, Gibbs.
Abby...
No talking, you.
So, I ran the sand grains from McBride's hair and nose and ears, and they're not all from
Afghanistan or Iran. No, they're from the U.S.
No.
Both.
Some grains were Middle Eastern and the others were from the Sonoran Desert.
It's a big place.
It extends from California to Arizona and into Mexico.
Uh, trace amounts like that would be so small, you couldn't possibly determine exactly where...
Best guess.
McBride was murdered and beheaded in the Copper State.
Arizona.
Thanks, Abbs.
If Ziva's in trouble, a badge might come in handy.
If you know how to get it to her, I'm game.
Well, even if someone could contact her, who would she trust?
Shmeil?
Well, the Man of Shmeil's showing his age, McGee.
She won't risk exposing him.
You have another option, Agent DiNozzo?
Let me get this right, DiNozzo. You want me to track down a former Mossad operative who has been trained to disappear?
She's also a former U.S. federal agent who's recently been under intense scrutiny.
And you want me to find her without letting anyone else know that I'm looking?
Well, sure. Because if you lead the wrong people in her direction, you might get her killed. That part you made quite clear.
Do we have a problem, Adam?
No.
I'm merely surprised that you would trust me with such responsibility.
I thought you did not like me.
I don't.
But Ziva trusts you, so I'm gonna have to.
I'll do what I can.
Hard to know who to trust anymore.
Has it ever been easy, Tobias?
Hell no.
But with big business profiting from acts of terror?
It's like Chicago, Capone in the '20s.
Yeah.
Well, they caught Capone. That make you feel any better?
No, it doesn't.
Our headless lieutenant was ordered to Iran only to have his orders cancelled without any record of it.
Who better to do that than his...
McGee, Captain Dominick Wayne, JSOC, financial records.
All right, I've got Captain Wayne's bank statements up.
What exactly am I looking for?
Temptation.
Payoffs. For throwing McBride under the bus, sending Gibbs into a desert trap.
No unusual activity or deposits.
It appears our captain's a typical government employee.
Broke. Well, maybe he didn't change the orders.
We could be wrong.
Want to find out?
Yeah. McGee, how's your handwriting?
Honey, you got something to light these with?
Who's that?
One second. Why don't you take care of it, honey.
Gentlemen. Must be important for you to come all the way out here.
We're having cake in just a minute.
Might make it worth your while.
Start with the truth, Captain.
Tell us about Lieutenant Chad McBride's orders in Iran.
More specifically, his orders to come home.
Come home?
What are you talking about?
He came home in a box.
It was your job to find out who put him there. - You did.
- You know, it's against regulations for military personnel to tell their loved ones their orders have changed.
But I used to write my wife anyway.
So did, uh, Chad McBride.
Just came in the mail today.
"Thought you should know, I talked to Captain Wayne.
"He changed my orders.
You can stop worrying."
Little did he know, you set him up to be executed.
I didn't know they were gonna kill him.
I wouldn't have made that call.
Who paid you?
Where's the money?
They didn't offer me money.
They offered pictures.
Of my infidelity.
Blackmail.
Another Capone tactic.
I couldn't let them take all this away.
Them?
I got a call. To change McBride's orders.
Another to send Agent Gibbs to Iran.
But I don't know who it was.
I-I'll give you my phone records, anything.
Including my resignation.
And don't forget your prison time. And your court-martial, Captain.
I'm sorry.
Tell it to McBride's wife.
Special Agent Gibbs, I want you to meet Tomas Mendez.
He's on the board of the Public Anti-Terrorism Coalition.
The coalition helps facilitate cooperation between private businesses and government agencies in the fight against terror.
What brings you here, Mr. Mendez?
Tomas was working closely with Homeland.
They were monitoring Parsa and the new terror cell.
Parsa's hard to pin down.
This was taken by a surveillance camera in one of my apartment buildings in Miami.
As part of the coalition initiatives, all of my building security cameras are linked with government lists.
And his face flagged.
We had been working with Homeland, but since Morrow was injured, we thought we'd reach out to you. Mm-hmm.
It's best we're all on the same page.
You own any property in Arizona, Mr. Mendez?
Beautiful state.
Why?
We think whoever's calling the shots has a cell working there.
We could use your help.
Are you getting out or what?
Well, actually, I was coming to find you.
If you're going down, I can tag along.
If that's okay?
Okay, look, you may not like me or what I do.
Whatever gave you that impression?
But when I investigate someone, I do it very well.
Well, then you and I have something in common.
What's this?
It's a peace offering.
Of sorts.
Eli David owns a farmhouse outside of Yavne'el. It's his safe house.
It's under a false name, and I don't think anyone knows about it.
Except maybe Ziva.
And a slimy Beltway lawyer.
That makes total sense to me.
You're grasping at straws.
You're looking for her.
I know you.
Then you know I have to vet this file.
I would hope so.
Or I'll start to think you actually trust me.
You know, I'm not gonna kiss you good night. What?
Why are you walking me to my car?
We breaking up?
If I could, I would.
Unfortunately, I trust you.
Well, feeling's mutual, so there you go.
Somebody's got to slay the dragons. Might as well be us. Mm-hmm.
Look, if this is gonna turn into a proposal, I'm just not ready.
How long did you know NCIS was in danger before you stepped in?
As soon as I found out some jackass was hiring turncoats, I came to you.
And I can only hope that you'd do the same if it was me.
No matter how this unfolds, Tobias, I got your back.
During the blitz, children were given little white flags to mark the positions of any unexploded incendiary bombs.
Seems like just building a victory garden would have been far less dangerous.
But not nearly so rewarding.
End of the war, I had a terrific shrapnel collection.
It was better than cash in the school playground.
I could even identify many of the pieces.
I'm hoping you still can, Duck.
Well, you're in luck, Jethro.
With the aid of Abby's chemical analysis and Timothy's database, we have done just that.
Times have changed since you were five.
Not as much as you might think.
By using the same methods that Ducky used when he was a child, I.D.'ing metal types and manufacturing marks, we can link the shrapnel removed from SECNAV Jarvis and others to devices that were used in the past.
A trigger used twice in Yemen.
Plastic explosive used by a white supremacy group in South Dakota.
Times have changed. People, not so much.
But the majority of links were on the casing itself.
Bike?
Yup.
Somebody filled all of the empty tubing on a mountain bike with the contents from a pipe bomb.
Hell of a signature.
And it's the signature we have on file.
Belongs to a soldier-of-fortune group the FBI has been tracking called The Brotherhood of Doubt.
No doubt made up of people who have little faith in the country that protects their inalienable rights.
Where?
Yuma.
Arizona.
That's good work, guys.
Hey, Tobias.
Come on back.
You're not going home yet.
Clear!
Clear!
Lieutenant McBride.
Got C-4 and detonators.
Photos of their targets.
Mr. Mendez?
Agent Gibbs.
I have a feeling this is not a coincidence?
You need to come with me.
Get you someplace safe.
Ziva.
Your information was correct, Tony.
Ziva was here.
But she's gone.
What happened?
Well, as you can see, clearly there was a struggle.
Three men are dead.
We will get them identified.
How do you know it was Ziva?
Because she told us.
Talk to me, Ziva.
Where are you?
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Secretary of the U.S. Navy is dead, Captain.
I knew when they got Jarvis, you were next.
You're in danger, Gibbs!
I got a call to send Agent Gibbs to Iran.
Captain Wayne, who paid you?
I don't know who it was.
Parsa started a new terror cell. Who's their next target?
Ziva David.
If Ziva's in trouble, a badge might come in handy.
If you know how to get it to her, I'm game.
You want me to track down a former Mossad operative who has been trained to disappear?
Well, sure.
Ziva was here.
How do you know it was Ziva?
Talk to me, Ziva.
Where are you?
Ziva.
Don't worry, Tony.
We will be okay.
Are you okay?
Do you want to get out?
No, I'm good.
Thanks.
♪ NCIS 11x02 ♪ Past, Present and Future Original air date on October 1, 2013
Agent DiNozzo, if you'll come with us, please?
You guys selling timeshares?
Mossad. Enter the vehicle.
We have information. It will be worth your while.
Agent DiNozzo. Welcome back to Israel.
Thank you, Director.
Hello, Tony.
Adam.
You make the big move from Shin Bet to Mossad, or you just here to say hi?
You know why I'm here. Do I?
Rest assured, Agent DiNozzo, we are all focused on one objective.
What's that?
Find Ziva David.
Agents, please come in.
Secretary Sarah Porter, I'd like you to meet our own Special Agent Leroy Gibbs.
Gibbs.
I know the name.
And FBI Agent Tobias Fornell.
Madame Secretary. Still getting used to the title.
This appointment's been bittersweet, to say the least.
Clayton Jarvis was a friend.
To us, as well, ma'am.
Well, then, what say we skip the formality, and you bring me up to speed on this terror cell-- Brotherhood of Doubt?
It certainly has an ominous ring to it.
The hideout in Arizona turned up evidence, no actual members.
FBI, Homeland, state police-- they're all on high alert.
And their supposed leader?
Name's Benham Parsa. He's a Pakistani national.
He's in the wind, like the rest of 'em.
But this man, Tomás Mendez, is on the board of an American anti-terror organization that can link the Brotherhood to Parsa.
That photo of Mendez was found pinned up
- in their compound. - It's a good bet he's their next target.
Can we protect him?
We kept Mendez in a hotel last night.
And I'm taking him to a safe house as soon as we're done here.
Don't let me keep you.
Gentlemen, as you may know, I'm not military.
My background's business.
And the first order of business the president has appointed me to address is preventing further attacks.
The second is to bring swift justice to those committing them, by any means necessary.
These windows were installed at the request of my predecessor.
He believed that with light comes clarity.
If you'll excuse me, Director, as much as I enjoy abstract David family talk, why don't you tell me what you know?
When was your last communication with Ziva?
She's not Mossad; not anymore.
Why are you looking for her?
The same reason you are.
I doubt that.
All right, I will give you that.
Eli would have wanted me to make sure she is safe.
Shin Bet identified the three men that were found dead at the David safe house.
Common criminals, no political affiliation.
Hired guns.
Presumably bought by the same people who tried to kill you and Agent Gibbs.
Do not tie my hands with your mistrust.
When was your last communication with Ziva?
Two nights ago.
She sent this.
Poor, misguided Ari.
No message; nothing since.
And you are worried that she is dead.
Tony, this is a kibbutz where Ziva and her siblings went as children.
Yesterday, a teacher there saw a woman matching Ziva's description walking the grounds.
The woman buried that in one of the gardens, and then she fled.
"I will ride a horse, visit America""
She wrote this as a kid?
Both sets of handwriting are Ziva's, yes.
But based on the ink saturation, the X and the last item were added fairly recently.
"Stop this for him""
What does that mean?
Stop what?
That is what concerns us.
So, what are we doing here?
The director said that we...
Yeah, the director said to check it out.
Listen, she's been shuffling me around since I got off the plane.
Does that sound like trustworthy behavior to you?
That's the apartment where Ziva grew up.
She brought me here once, to show me.
Listen... when I asked you to look for her...
Thank you.
Tony.
This is it.
Hello? Anybody home?
Government agents?
Can you put the hammer down, please?
I'm sorry. I-I... I was carrying groceries.
I must have forgotten to close the door. Are you Dr. Deena Bashan?
Yes.
What is this about?
Ziva David.
You know her?
I have known her my whole life.
We grew up in this building together.
Is she okay?
Hey. Thought you left a while ago.
I was trying, but, uh, Mr. Mendez here has been slow to embrace the concept of protective custody.
I'm not afraid of these bastards.
It's not about fear.
I do business all over the country, Agent Gibbs.
Any alterations to my schedule-- to my life-- would be a victory for the Brotherhood.
These are special circumstances.
Special only if we allow the terrorists to make them so.
Look, don't be a dumb ass.
You keep Agent Fornell in your hip pocket, or you're a dead man. For freedom, I'd hardly be the first to die.
But very well.
Really?
I spent the last hour saying pretty much the same thing.
Then let's hope you're better at protection than you are at persuasion.
Save me.
I inherited this place from my parents.
The Davids lived across the hall.
I was older than Ziva, but I looked up to her.
Even then, she was a force.
Determined, inquisitive, stubborn as a mule.
Sounds about right.
I'm babbling, and you have questions. Please.
When was the last time you saw her? It was, uh, months ago.
At her father's funeral.
Where did you get this?
You have seen it before?
I had one, too.
This was, uh, Ziva's.
We were so young, we were just learning English.
We called them our "wills""
Our teacher said that if we buried our wishes in the ground and thought about them every night, they would become truth.
Why is it crossed out?
We do not know. "Stop this for him."
Do you know what it means?
I know that her work is dangerous.
Please, just tell me.
We are doing all that we can to make sure she is safe.
Thank you for the tea, Doctor.
Um... you all right? Yes.
It's just, uh... she mentioned you at the funeral.
I could see what she felt.
"Stop this for him""
Perhaps the "him" is you.
"I will be a ballerina."
I don't get it.
This is Ziva. Shouldn't it say "ninja" or something?
Apparently, there was a pre-ferocious phase. Huh.
So, how's this list about you?
I don't know if it is.
It's a long story. I...
Why are you whispering?
Because I'm in Mossad headquarters.
So you're working together, but you're whispering because...
I don't know.
It's Mossad.
It just felt right.
Well, I got to say, access to their resources will be a huge help.
Yeah, but who knows how long that's gonna last.
I need an angle.
What's my angle?
Give me an angle, McGee.
We got a trace on the last text Ziva sent you. Ooh.
That's good.
Ari picture. Where was she?
Connected to a WiFi at an Internet cafe in the center of Tel Aviv.
You got an address?
Check your inbox.
Look at that.
McLoving you long-distance.
Bullets give us anything, Abbs?
Um, standard .308
Winchesters.
Anyone could buy them online. And there's nothing to tie them to this... stupid Brotherhood of Doubt thing.
The name is such a downer.
I don't even like saying it.
What is this?
It's just a little mock-up I made to try to make sense out of stuff.
Bullet trajectories?
Yeah, all the slugs from Tony's apartment landed at the same angle and came from the same point of origin.
Rooftop across the street.
Well, that's what Homeland says.
So what doesn't make any sense?
Their lone witness said that he saw someone on the roof, just after the shots were fired.
But there's no one and nothing there.
Can you beam this up to McGee?
Well, I can't "beam it," Captain Kirk, but I could send it up, sure.
Captain who?
The witness is a maintenance man in the building where the shots were fired from.
Gerald Carlin.
Claims he was on his lunch break when he glanced out a window and saw a figure running from the roof.
He saw his own roof from his own building? How does that work?
It doesn't.
Where was the lunch?
Thought you'd ask that. He was at a bar across the street called Clancy's.
Bartender confirms Carlin was there eating a turkey club, glancing out the window when he heard the shots.
Were there drinks?
Four beers, two tequilas.
So he wasn't seeing anything too clearly.
Or he was paid to see what he saw.
Okay, so if... the shots didn't come from the roof, they had to have come from the top floor.
Homeland interview tenants? Top floor...
All but one.
Lisa Pierway.
She never answered the door.
NCIS!
Lisa Pierway?
Boss, you smell that?
Boss?
There are signs of an intense struggle before she was strangled.
Shooter didn't even bother to make it look like a robbery.
Lisa Pierway was a pharmaceutical rep.
Boxes of drug samples left untouched in her closet.
Guy was a pro.
Cleaned up after himself. No prints.
Don't be too sure, Jethro.
What I thought at first were petechiae in Ms. Pierway's eyes, were actual subconjunctival hemorrhages, likely caused by the killer's thumbs.
He eye-gouged her.
Yes, a bully tactic, indeed.
But one that may prove perversely fortunate.
Thumbprints.
She's wearing contact lenses.
If Abby can pull even a partial off one of them, we just may find our killer.
Yeah, Tobias, what's up?
Protecting Ricky Ricardo is not all conga drums and "Babalu," you know.
It's only been two days.
And Mendez already has himself a full dance card.
In the next few weeks, he'll be wining and dining every big shot in town supporting that anti-terrorism group he's part of.
And I'll be right there in his hip pocket.
Tobias, you can always say no.
Well, that's the kicker.
My boss says I can't.
The guy's not a-a gangster, Gibbs.
He's a law-abiding millionaire out to save the world with his powerful friends.
And my job is to say yes.
Banana pancakes, extra bacon.
Could I get... extra extra bacon?
Breakfast anytime?
I crave banana pancakes when I get agitated. And nothing agitates me more than a hospital visit.
You might want to cut back on the bacon.
It's not me.
Lawrence Walters.
Philanthropist billionaire losing a battle with cancer.
He wants to donate a bundle to the anti-terror campaign before he departs.
Mendez plans to visit later today.
Seems like a guy worth visiting.
And that's how you cheer people up?
All I feel is more shallow.
Extra bacon.
He's on me.
Keep the change.
Thanks.
Your treat?
You wanted cheering up.
And you think you can buy me?
Who am I kidding?
Of course he can.
There's no way Ziva spends all day at some Internet cafe.
Go back to the time she sent the text, check again.
Any luck?
We're gonna have to make our own.
Would you care to elaborate?
I'm heading to the cafe to see if anybody remembers her coming in.
Tell the driver Shamayim Hospital.
It will be easier. The cafe is across the street.
From the hospital?
Yes. Why?
The night before Ziva sent the picture, she was attacked at the safe house.
You think she was seeking medical attention?
I'll bet you that WiFi signal reaches across the street.
Give me an angle favoring the hospital.
That's pretty impressive.
Mossad got eyes all over the city?
All over the world, Agent DiNozzo.
It is our job to see.
That's her.
Blow that up.
There she is.
To whom is she speaking?
Dr. Bashan.
She lied.
Hear you pulled a thumbprint.
It's just a partial. Yeah?
Partial enough?
Enough to get a name.
Henry Coldwell.
The record says he was dishonorably discharged from the Army in '06, after serving two years for aggravated assault but not before he got sniper training.
That's our shooter.
Well, I'm sure if you asked McGee he can probably tell you more. Probably even find him.
That's good news, Abbs.
What's wrong?
Well... you yourself said that Parsa is paying hired guns and bombers.
I mean, this guy could just be some flunky.
A flunky that leads to Parsa.
I don't know, Gibbs. I think...
I just think all this worrying is finally getting to me.
Tony getting shot at, and... Ziva, where is she?
If I can't figure out who's trying to kill everyone I love, I'll... never forgive herself.
This... is a good start.
Yeah, but, Gibbs, it's a brotherhood.
Which means that that jerk has brothers.
Yes. We're gonna get 'em.
We're gonna get 'em all.
You lied to me.
Agent DiNozzo. What are you doing here?
You said you hadn't seen Ziva in months-- hey.
You think you're protecting her?
I'm on her side.
I know that.
Then why did you lie to me?
She came to me after she had been attacked.
I stitched up the wound in her leg and took her to my home so that she could rest.
But then, uh...
Then what?
I thought I could save both of us the heartache by keeping quiet, but she then she started to talk of old times.
Of Ari.
She did not know that when she went off to save the world, I was here, falling in love with her brother.
He was going to propose to me when she killed him.
And you told her that. Yes.
And she tried to explain it away.
She said that he was hurting good people.
But Ari was also hurt.
His father had broken him.
Still... I saw the smiling boy from across the hall.
The good boy.
Ziva begged me to forgive her.
I could not.
Where did she go?
I do not know.
Don't lie to me.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You knew she was in danger, and you lied to me. I asked you point blank.
And had any other agent come to the door, I would have said yes.
Why should she have the man that she loves when she took mine from me?
I'm gonna find her.
Ziva is gone, Agent DiNozzo.
When she left me that night, she was not the same person.
So that's it, huh?
We believe that Ziva's absence is voluntary, and so do you.
Everything Mossad has on known David family contacts.
Good luck.
Director...
She left something at the safe house.
Can you help me get it back?
Check the file.
You just stay close to us, Mendez. Follow the route to the ICU as planned.
Once inside, you've got 30 minutes with Walters.
Windows closed, drapes drawn; we've been through this.
And you don't talk to anybody else without one of us present. Not even on your cell phone.
May we get in there, please? The poor man doesn't have much time.
What did I just say about phones? You're here with me.
This is business. Won't be a second.
Where is he?
Tried him twice, boss.
He's not picking up.
Try him again.
Uh, yeah, I'm here.
Hey, boss.
Oh, that beard's getting pretty serious.
When was the last time you shaved-
- Cairo?
I guess so.
I... meant to do that this morning.
Hey, this a bad time for you, - DiNozzo?
- No, boss.
It's good. I'm ready.
You still in Yemen?
Israel. Circled back to Tel Aviv.
Just got to Be'er Sheva.
One of Ziva's contacts, uh, Nava Adi, told me that, uh, she saw her last week. I'm getting close.
I can feel it.
You said that two months ago.
So, what about you guys?
My sniper friend pop his head up? Coldwell.
Nope.
Still off the radar.
Old man Walters?
Hanging in there; no excitement since the explosion.
Although Fornell keeps talking about how he would have been a goner if Mendez hadn't taken that call.
As far as Parsa goes...
Enough.
Unless he booked his flight home, an update's wasted on him.
You want me to give up on Ziva?
I didn't say that.
Are you giving up on her?
I didn't say that, either.
Boss, maybe you could try saying what you're saying?
If Ziva doesn't want to be found, you aren't going to find her.
I'm saying you should respect that. I do.
I just...
I need to go off the grid for a few days, follow this lead.
I just need a little more time.
You do what you have to do.
You know how hard that was.
Gibbs was wrong.
I did not want you to find me and yet, you did.
I should have told him.
You cannot beat down my door one minute, and expect me to face my old life again the next.
I had to take the call.
You did not have to do any of this.
Why are you here?
Because you invited me.
That was before. Before what?
You should not have come.
Our people have been working day and night, Madame Secretary.
I'm sure they have, Director. But the president needs progress in this case-- results.
And after months of nothing...
Ma'am, if I may.
A little help from you wouldn't hurt.
Gibbs...
No, please.
Agent Gibbs, with your reputation,
I expected Parsa to be disposed of long before now.
So, do tell me, please, what sort of help am I not providing?
Influence.
My reputation aside, there's only one guy who's not cooperating, and he's the only one we know who has any direct contact with Parsa.
Captain Wayne.
Relieved of his duties at JSOC. He lawyered up.
Wayne may be dead to JSOC.
He is not dead to us.
And certainly not to you.
That tour of Iran he set you up on must have left an impression.
A call from you may get us some interagency cooperation. Count on it.
In fact, why wait?
Put me through right now.
This is Director Vance. Please hold for the Secretary of the Navy.
Old friend. Thank you.
You asked how I found you.
For a long time, I was looking ahead.
I kept telling myself, "You know how she thinks.
"You know her.
All you have to do is anticipate her next move""
And then one night, I had a dream.
Everything was all lined up together.
Your family's safe house, Ari's picture, you, your old friend Bashan.
And when I woke up, I knew. You weren't looking ahead.
You were looking back.
I tracked you down to Amman, where your mother was killed.
And then, your grandparents' graves in Meron.
The opera house in Cairo where you took Tali.
And finally, I found you here. Of course.
The house where you were born.
After my father died, returning to these places seemed... necessary.
It started off as a good thing, but then I saw Deena Bashan, and...
This all can't be because of her.
No, it's not because of her. It's because of me.
You had to kill Ari. One person loving him doesn't change that.
Yes, but I loved him.
Just as I loved my father and my mother and Tali.
How can I not think that for every man I killed, there is someone out there crying for him?
It's part of the job.
You gotta leave it at that.
Deena blamed me.
I thought that by going back to these places, I would someone erase all of that, but each stop just made it clearer.
She was right.
The center of all this pain is me.
Ziva, this isn't you.
This is me, Tony.
This is what I made of myself.
But it's not who I wanted to be.
I know. I know.
You wanted to be a ballerina.
"Stop this for him"" Who?
Ari?
Eli?
God?
This was supposed to stay buried.
Orli was looking for you, too.
This little girl was strong.
She could've walked away from her father's world. Things would have been different.
It's never too late.
Yes, it is.
This is the house that you were born in.
The universe is practically begging you to wipe the slate clean.
I did notice that there's plenty of room on the back of this list... to start a new one.
Maybe I could help you with that.
I'm so sorry, Gibbs.
You save your marriage?
My kids won't even talk to me.
Wasn't quite worth it, then, was it?
Look, I'm just waiting on my trial date.
Trying to put this whole thing behind me.
Nothing is behind you, Wayne.
Nothing is behind any of us.
You got to start talking.
Who are these guys?
Where is Parsa?
All I got were text messages.
I tried using JSOC to attach some names, but all the calls came back unlisted.
Just a... a 305 area code. 305?
Look, I know Arizona is where you found a hideout, but all communication to me came through Florida.
Anything else?
You got a shot here, Wayne, to redeem yourself.
You're not gonna get another one.
I wish I could.
I want to make amends.
Believe me, I do.
Then do what's right next time.
Not just what's right for you.
Lose the gun.
You have no idea what's coming tonight.
Neither do you.
Feel better?
No.
But it's a start.
You don't have to do this alone.
Come back to DC with me.
The first thing on my new list was,
"I will let go of the badge."
I'm not talking about NCIS.
Listen, you can bag groceries, for all I care.
Just come home.
I just want you to come home... with me.
I don't think that's a ver--
Hey, listen,
I know it's hard and I know you want to change.
I can change with you.
I'm fighting for you, Ziva.
I know.
Robberies...
Assaults... hardly the international conspiracy type.
What conspiracy?
I just got paid to get you out of the picture, is all.
Yeah, but it didn't work, did it?
Who paid you?
Don't know.
I just get text messages, and bags of money after.
After what?
What happens tonight?
Your boy Wayne didn't tell you?
Look, I'm not trying to break your heart over here.
And Wayne didn't know that he led me to you.
But maybe you should've tried to ask him these questions a little harder.
Boss. You're not gonna believe this.
This guy's got a bunch of cryptic numbers on his phone.
Orders to keep you away from a predetermined target.
All from dummy numbers with the same 305 area code.
What part won't I believe? Okay.
The part that I don't.
I traced the blocked numbers to a mainframe owned by a series of dummy corps.
One buffer after another till I hit an actual, legitimate company called Gran Castillo.
It's a real estate company.
Mendez.
And get this-- the short-range detonators used in both bombings, transmits using a phone signal.
Mendez's phone.
Call he got at the hospital was him triggering the bomb.
Could be the only reason he's part of that anti-terror group is to stop guys from Walters from trying to support it.
Call Fornell.
Pull a team together.
Tell every agent to get to the safe house; FBI, too.
What about you?
Where is it happening tonight?
And what if I don't tell you?
You've reached Agent Tobias Fornell with the Federal Bureau of Invest...
Let's go.
Not a good time?
I'll call them back.
I'm a little preoccupied, thinking about our last visit to your friend Walters.
I wish I could forget.
Got Walters' security team in sight.
Walters is more comfortable with hospice care.
Home is where I'd want to spend my last days.
Exactly how much is he donating?
He's signing over $2 billion to fight terrorism.
Targets are down.
The place is all yours.
Plant the device and get out.
Coldwell.
What are you doing here, Wayne?
We're all good.
It's coming together like clockwork.
I can't go through with it, not now.
It's wrong.
Gibbs... Me... Mendez's phone.
Do it, Gibbs.
Do it.
Check on Walters' security team.
I don't see them up there.
Just let me get my phone.
We need to go over the rules again?
I know them by heart.
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Mendez lived completely counter to everything he presented to the world, Gibbs, and all for profit.
What the world saw wasn't real.
Just can't believe it. You shot me in the ass!
It's a surface wound, through and through.
Through the ass.
Painkillers.
How'd I miss it, Gibbs?
We all missed it.
Yeah, but I'm the one got shot in the ass for it.
This wasn't just Mendez. No.
Parsa's pulling the strings.
And he's still out there somewhere. Yeah.
And not alone.
There's still time for you to change your mind.
at am I gonna tell people?
That you were right.
I have to start over.
Okay, you and I both know that's not gonna be enough for Abby.
Tell her that I am... honoring Gibbs.
Gibbs?
"Stop this for him."
Of course.
Gibbs.
I want to make him proud.
He taught me to follow my heart, and I know that I have to I have to do this... alone.
I have to let go of everything, or I will be... pulled back to where I started.
Tell Abby that for me.
She'll understand.
I will.
So, what about Gibbs?
You gonna call him?
I don't know.
You gotta call the guy.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, it'll be fine.
You know how he is on the phone-- functional mute.
You'll hardly know he's there.
He's a good listener.
Tony... you are so...
Handsome?
Funny?
What?
Loved.
Okay.
This is not easy.
Hardest 180 of my life.
Hey, Ziver.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
You looking for Jerry?
Yeah. Registered letter for him.
Mailman brought it late yesterday afternoon.
I signed for it.
Well, give it to me, Courtney.
I'll put it in his apartment.
Thanks.
I don't want to be a pain, but I've still got ants in my kitchen.
Exterminator's coming this afternoon.
They'll be done before you get back from class, I promise.
Thanks. That's what I'm here for.
♪ NCIS 11x03 ♪ Under the Radar Original air date on October 8, 2013
Hey, Murray.
What are you doing at Ziva's desk?
Officially not her desk anymore, Agent DiNozzo.
Is Gibbs going to replace her?
I don't know.
It's only been a week.
He hasn't really discussed it with me.
repeat, Murray:
What are you doing?
S.O.P. Just... scrubbing her hard drive.
This kind of looks like you.
It is.
How close were you two?
Morning, Agent McGee.
Hey, Tim.
What's the matter?
Can't find my badge and I.D. Ooh.
Lost your creds-- that's serious.
Yeah, I know, Tony.
I couldn't find them at home; I was hoping I'd left them here.
Ooh, you're so screwed.
Thank God I didn't lose my building access card.
Lost creds initiate an automatic I.G. 2B investigation.
It's almost as serious as losing your weapon.
You didn't lose that, too, did you?
You keep talking and I'll use it.
Hey, you've got to chill out, all right?
No need to report the loss if they're just gonna show up, okay?
You just need to think.
Visualize.
When was the last time you saw them?
Tony, I've tried that. Explosion. Blew up a J.G.'s apartment.
Casualties?
Yeah, building manager.
You waiting for a special invitation, McGee?
No, boss.
Whoa, I didn't get a good look at that, sir.
Mm-hmm. Thank you, Special Agent Gibbs.
The baby-faced newbie cop is actually checking I.D.'s.
How unusual... and unfortunate for you.
As you can see, Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
All right, on three.
One, two...
That's me. That's me.
Uh, I know how you feel about taking personal calls in the field, Doctor, but this is Breena.
We're supposed to meet with the adoption lawyer today, so...
Answer it, Mr. Palmer.
Yeah?
Yeah. Hey, Breena.
Adoption lawyer? They're really gonna do it?
Most certainly, and...
Breena's gonna take a while.
Would you mind giving me a hand?
Oh. Well... it's not really my...
Well... Sure.
One, two, three.
Yeah, this is gonna be interesting.
Poor man took the brunt of the explosion.
Shaped charge.
Meant to kill whoever opened the door.
I was knocking at the door. I-I was trying to give him his mail, and...
I just knew the lieutenant as a neighbor.
He was a nice guy, but quiet.
We really didn't talk that much about anything important.
What can you tell me about the registered letter?
Huh? The letter you signed for.
I'm sorry, but my ears are still ringing.
Get yourself checked out at the hospital.
We'll contact you later, okay?
Spoke with Lieutenant Keith's commander at the Pentagon.
Keith is on two weeks' leave visiting his mother in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
He's away, and somebody booby-traps his apartment, hmm?
Lieutenant Junior Grade Terence Keith, 26, grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
Graduated from Montana State, went to Officers' Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island.
I like Rhode Island.
He wanted to fly, but washed out of preliminary flight training at Whiting Field in Florida.
Was assigned to his present duty at the Pentagon last year.
He washed out?
What was his problem?
Checking on it. Boss, something's wrong. That was Keith's mother in Fort Wayne.
He's not there and she isn't expecting him.
She talk to him? Not in weeks.
Anything?
BOLO's out on Lieutenant Keith's gray '09 pickup.
No action on his credit card in the last two days, and his cell phone is turned off.
NCIS.
She doesn't work here anymore.
I'm sorry, I don't have a forwarding number.
Sure thing.
Ziva's dental hygienist-- she had an appointment tomorrow. They were calling to confirm.
It's hard to believe she's not coming back.
She wanted to move on. So let's move on.
Hey!
Probie! ra.
Am I surprised to see you here.
Yeah. I have managed to avoid coming to headquarters for 20 years, and now they call me in.
I got a meeting with Vance.
I'm already half an hour late.
Is he on this floor?
No.
One flight up. Okay. All right.
It's good to see you, Vera. Good to see you.
You're looking, uh, good there, Leroy.
We're gonna catch up later.
Yeah.
Who is that, boss?
Uh, Special Agent Vera Strickland.
"Probie"?
Mike Franks' last partner.
McGee, come on, you're with me. Pentagon. We're gonna go talk to Lieutenant Keith's C.O.
Uh, boss, boss, Abby needs my help.
Actually, she said she needed my help with the bomb residue.
That okay?
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay.
Did you just lie to the all-knowing Gibbs?
It was stupid, wasn't it?
I panicked. They're not gonna let me into the Pentagon without my creds.
I'm just gonna have to notify the I.G. and report the loss.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't make that phone call.
They're gonna show up. Did you do something with them, Tony?
No.
No.
No.
You probably put them somewhere stupid.
Where were you last night?
I've been over it a thousand times. Did you have a booty call with your special friend, D.O.D. Delilah?
What is this?
Hmm.
Whew!
Stinks. What are you mumbling about, Mr. Palmer?
Something's melted under the fabric.
Here, see it? Well, take it up to Abby; she'll identify it.
Ah. Breena texting me.
We had to reschedule our appointment with the adoption lawyer.
His only opening is in...
20 minutes.
Great.
I'll have to tell her I can't make it.
I'll take that up. You go meet with Breena.
Oh... I appreciate that so much, Dr. Mallard.
She's been really nervous about the whole adoption process.
I'm not nervous;
she's nervous. Tell her to relax and think about the end result.
Mr. Palmer, I... envy your chance to have a family.
Go.
Abby.
Hang on, this is my favorite part.
Ah. How good were the Sterile Puppets last night?
Yeah, that sound system at RFK was pretty killer.
Oh, and Lynch-- what a great drummer, huh?
Please thank him for the tickets.
It was so fun being in the pit.
Did you see Twitter? The Puppets have been trending since the concert.
That's nice.
What's wrong?
Ouch. Yeah. Might have been during the concert, all that bumping and shoving.
Oh, God, I hope not.
I haven't told him.
Abby, what if I was pickpocketed?
What's this?
It's Ziva's scarf.
Oh, yeah.
I remember this.
She wore it her first day at NCIS.
Yeah, and then after we became friends, I complimented her on it, and she just gave it to me.
And I wore it today, and it just made me feel better.
So maybe that'll work for you.
Mm.
Have you talked to her?
Texted her. I haven't heard back.
Oh, the good doctor.
What dost thou bringeth me? The vestments of the newly departed, milady.
The heat of the explosion fused something onto his shirt.
It looks like... plastic?
Ooh. Maybe a credit card?
I'll check.
- Any luck with the bomb? - I was able to determine that the explosive was C-4.
And based on the size of the blast, I'd think it was probably ten to 12 ounces.
That would explain the extensive trauma to the building manager's body.
Any luck locating the lieutenant, Agent McGee?
Unfortunately, no. I don't believe I've ever seen you wearing a scarf before.
I'm confused.
Keith isn't in Fort Wayne?
His mother hasn't seen or talked to him in weeks-- she isn't expecting him.
I don't know what to tell you, Agent Gibbs.
Why would he lie?
Anything at work that could put him in danger?
No. His duties are primarily administrative.
He doesn't have top-secret clearance.
I can't believe someone would try to kill him.
He's quiet, keeps to himself.
What can you tell me about
Lieutenant Keith's personal life? Not much. Matter of fact, I don't think I've ever seen him outside the office.
Is he good at his job?
Adequate. He doesn't have his heart in it.
Once Keith washed out of flight school, I think he was just riding his time out.
Offered him a job that would put him on a career track, but he wasn't interested.
He give a reason?
No. He's a strange duck.
How do you mean?
I just... can't get a handle on the guy.
So this is MTAC.
Mm-hmm. Vera, I've seen your face on that screen more times than I can remember.
Wow, I didn't realize it was so big.
Must've shown every wrinkle on my mug.
You got to give a girl a break.
McGee? What are you doing?
I can't find my car key. And, uh, I thought I dropped it in here.
McGee, I'd like to introduce you to Special Agent Vera Strickland.
Oh, well, we sort of already met.
He's one of Gibbs' kids, right?
Right. Vera's retiring at the end of the month.
She's gonna be here with us at headquarters for the last couple of weeks as she processes out.
Where alls I have to do is keep my nose clean, stay out of trouble, and then I ride off into the sunset on my hog.
She's not kidding.
Vera's got a Harley. V-twin, four-stroke, Electra Glide classic.
Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony.
I know who built the bomb. Who?
Well, I want to tell Gibbs myself.
Where is he?
Abbs?
You can tell me;
we are a team.
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs! I got a fingerprint and DNA off the bomb's trigger mechanism.
And I ran it through a database of one, and I got a name.
Abbs?
Who? Lieutenant Junior Grade Terence Keith.
He blew up his own apartment.
Oh, hi.
Why would Keith booby-trap his own apartment?
Looks like Lieutenant Keith called the same number several times over the past few days.
Yep. Belongs to a Lieutenant Junior Grade Dana Robbins, an aviator.
Assigned to the carrier Benjamin Franklin.
It's home-ported in Norfolk.
She only answered the first call.
Talked for less than three minutes.
She's not aboard the ship;
I left a message.
I've been talking to people in Fort Wayne about Keith. Not exactly an ideal childhood.
Father left when he was six.
He was an alcoholic.
They haven't had much contact since.
Keith was a nerd in high school.
Science geek.
Captain Laramie hinted he was a little strange.
Yeah. High school advisor said he was a loner, bullied.
Nose got broken his senior year.
Lot of wedgies. Probably why he went out of state to college, to get away.
Doesn't sound like Officer Candidate material.
Found the break room.
The coffee sucks.
Director Vance said there was an empty desk around here where I could park my ass.
This will do.
No. Not that one.
Okay. What's the problem, boys?
Vera, come on. Got a desk for you.
All right.
Oh... well... well, it's a little cramped.
No. It's cozy.
Yeah, well, what the hell, it's just till the end of the month.
And you're not even gonna know I'm here.
No, boss.
Back to work.
Gibbs, can you come to the lab?
Yeah, Abbs. I'm on my way down.
Through the loop. Round.
Back through the loop.
Are you knitting?
I'm trying.
They're gonna be booties for Jimmy and Breena's baby.
That's months away, Abbs.
Well, it's gonna take me that long.
This can't be the reason you brought me down here.
We got lucky.
Major Mass Spec determined the specific signature on the C-4.
It's a unique combination of a plasticizer and dinitrobutane.
It's manufactured by a company in Des Moines, Iowa.
Why are we lucky?
I'm so glad you asked.
They only have one distributor in the Mid-Atlantic states:
Pyrotechnic Engineering.
And they are just across the river in Anacostia.
You get anything from Keith's laptop? Oh.
Have no fear.
I will access this hard drive.
Boss, it's unbelievable-- she and Mike Franks were involved in the capture of Noriega in Panama?
Yeah, he sought asylum at the Vatican Embassy.
It was Vera's idea to blast him out - with Van Halen music.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's ancient history, boys; I've heard it a thousand times.
What about our current case?
Work, work, work.
Gibbs used to be fun.
You connect with the pilot
Keith was trying to call? Lieutenant Robbins is on her way here.
His college transcripts just came in.
It's interesting-- his major was electronic engineering, which would give him the technical know-how to make a bomb.
Yeah, Abby I.D.'d the explosive.
It was distributed by Pyrotechnic Engineering in Anacostia.
You two, go, check it out.
Boss, I got a problem.
I lost my creds.
I haven't seen them since last night.
You're just telling me now?
You report this to our I.G.?
I wanted to tell you first.
I'll notify them.
Special Agent Strickland.
Yeah?
Gear up.
What?
Vance said you're available if needed. Uh, uh-uh, no way.
No, no, no I'm just here to...
Vera... to process out.
Vera. That's- - No...
Go with DiNozzo. DiNozzo?
Oh, I've heard stories about this guy.
His car blew up, he almost died from the plague.
And didn't someone shoot at you a few months ago?
He missed.
I only have two weeks left, Gibbs.
I shouldn't even be in the same room as this moving target.
Go.
This is your fault, McGee.
You're gonna pay.
So, tell me, Vera, how do you like working with a partner?
You want to "good cop/bad cop"?
You, Inspector Clouseau, are an accident waiting to happen.
And you are definitely not my partner.
So, how did you work with Mike Franks, then?
We had a very special relationship.
Really?
How so? Yeah, I'm not going into it, DiNozzo.
Okay? This is your show;
I'm here for the ride.
Speaking of ride, I don't like the way you drive.
Mr. Frazier?
Yeah?
Special Agent DiNozzo. Special Agent Strickland.
What can I do for you?
Have you seen this guy?
Yeah. Yeah.
He was here. Couple of weeks ago.
Wanted to buy some C-4.
He's in the Navy?
Yeah.
Yeah. Uh, did you sell him the plastic?
No, no. You have to be licensed to buy from us.
Did... The lieutenant tell you what he wanted to do with it?
He said he just needed a pound or two to blast some tree stumps.
So he left empty-handed?
Yeah. But I gave him the name of a demolitions contractor who might take a small job.
The powder monkey got a name?
Yeah, yeah. Larry Purcell.
Works out of his house in Elkridge.
You got any questions, DiNozzo?
Moi?
Don't even know why I'm here.
Thanks.
Lieutenant Robbins.
Thanks for coming in. Have a seat.
You want some coffee?
Sure, thank you. I'll try to make this as quick as possible.
I know you're deploying in the morning.
You must be excited.
I am.
I've been training for this a long time. F-18?
Yes, sir.
I get paid to fly a Super Hornet-- doesn't get any better than that.
That's great.
Special Agent McGee didn't tell me what this is about.
Lieutenant J.G. Terence Keith.
Terry?
Yeah. You talk to him recently?
Couple days ago.
Is something wrong?
We can't find him.
He in some kind of trouble?
How do you know him?
Um, met him in Pensacola for A.P.I.
We moved on together to Whiting Field for preliminary flight training.
You two close?
No. Just... classmates.
Why'd he wash out?
He was actually a good pilot.
The pressure got to him.
Pressure, huh?
Terry probably needed to be on some kind of antianxiety medication.
But you can't do that and fly.
He started acting out.
There a confrontation?
No.
In the last few weeks of flight training, Terry knew he wasn't gonna make the cut.
He became sullen and withdrawn.
And angry with me.
I don't think he could accept the fact that a woman was going to move on to strike jet training and he wasn't.
The call the other day-- what'd he want?
Couldn't figure it out.
It was strange. He was... strange.
We weren't on the best of terms when he left Whiting Field, and... now he wants to see me before I deploy.
What'd you tell him?
That I was busy.
I needed to see friends and family before I shipped out.
Why don't you handle this one, DiNozzo.
Okay.
Hey there.
You Larry Purcell?
Who's asking?
NCIS Special Agent DiNozzo, and company.
You a Navy cop? Yeah.
You know the lieutenant?
No.
You didn't look at the picture, Larry.
Why don't you try looking at the picture.
Yeah, maybe he was here a couple weeks ago.
You help him remove a tree stump? What?
No.
I'm betting you sold him some C-4.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Yeah. I have to check my records.
What'd you say his name was?
I didn't.
Try Terence Keith.
I'll be back.
Thanks, Larry.
Squirrely dude.
Nice.
Vera!
I had a good job with a contractor up north, but I got laid off.
I couldn't find anything steady, so I started doing odd jobs.
I needed the money, okay?
So you sold Lieutenant Keith the C-4.
He never told me his name, and I didn't know he was in the Navy.
What'd you think he was gonna do with explosives?
He said he was gonna do some demo work on a friend's farm.
And you believed him? I believed the cash he gave me.
I had no idea he was gonna rig his apartment and kill somebody.
A little help would be nice, McGee.
Sorry.
Is it broken?
A severe ankle sprain. You're lucky.
Lucky?
What happens now?
You're gonna be held in a detention facility and booked for accessory to murder, illegal sale of explosives, and assaulting two federal officers.
Two federal officers?
Yeah.
Me and Agent Strickland. That old broad is an agent?
I just need one minute with that clown.
Can I make some kind of a deal?
Unless you can tell us where Keith is, you've got nothing to offer.
Do I get a break if I sign a confession?
Write it all down.
And please be specific. We estimate he used ten to 12 ounces of C-4.
How much did you sell him?
Ounces?
I sold him 200 pounds.
That's almost as much C-4 as was used to take out the Cole in Yemen.
Gibbs, what are we dealing with?
Keith has something big planned.
Agreed, but why did he rig his own apartment?
Whoever comes to investigate after the fact-- take him out, Leon.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Keith didn't know that the building manager was gonna open that door prematurely.
Gibbs, what-what's his ultimate target?
I don't know.
I got to notify Homeland, FBI and the ATF.
So, Gibbs, your golden gut was right.
I finally got into Keith's hard drive.
For the last year, he's been buying prescription antidepressants online from a Canadian pharmacy using an assumed name.
And also, this, um, plastic blob that was melted on the apartment manager's shirt, it is not a credit card.
It is actually an FAA private pilot's license.
Newly issued and sent by registered mail to Lieutenant Keith two days ago.
The letter the manager was gonna put in Keith's apartment.
No good deed goes unpunished. Lieutenant Keith took his final check ride for a civilian pilot's license two weeks ago at a small airport in rural Virginia,
Lafayette Field.
His instructor was Kip Logan.
DiNozzo. On my way, boss.
Want to take a ride, Vera?
Bite me.
Keith was the best student I ever had.
Didn't have to teach him anything.
The Navy did that.
Qualifying him was a no-brainer.
Once he passed the written exam and logged the minimum hours, I issued him a temporary certificate and filed the paperwork with the FAA.
Seen him recently?
Yesterday afternoon.
Checked him out in a STOL he wanted to rent.
STOL? What's that? S-T-O-L.
Short Take-Off and Landing. Two-seater.
Lot of fun to fly.
You can land them anywhere-- pasture, field. It's great for cross-country trips.
Did he rent it?
Yeah. He booked it for two days.
He say where he was going?
Didn't tell me.
We pulled the radar and security footage from Lafayette Field for yesterday afternoon.
The plane Lieutenant Keith rented took off at 1421.
It circled the field, then headed in a southwesterly direction.
Three minutes later, it dropped below radar coverage.
Did it ever pop up on the radar again?
No. A STOL has the capability to fly very low and very slow.
It'd be like finding a needle in a haystack.
So potentially, we have a bomb aboard an airplane on a suicide mission with an unknown target.
Alert all agents and analysts:
no one leaves until we find Lieutenant Keith.
Thank you, sweetheart.
You have just made my day.
I'm out of here!
Oh, that was H.R., and because of my line-of-duty injury,
And I have you to thank for that, DiNozzo.
Well, it was my pleasure.
Oh!
Here let me help you with... No, don't.
Back. Back.
Don't you come near me.
Just a... Back.
You catch that S.O.B.
Before he hurts anybody else, probie.
We'll see you around, Vera.
You know, I'm gonna have a lot of time on my hands.
Maybe I'll drop by, see what you're working on in the basement.
Front door still unlocked?
Just put it around...
No. I said no. Don't touch me.
Come on, come on, come on. Back to work.
Keith took off 48 hours ago.
Where is he? Call you next week?
Yes, boss.
...stationed at Lafayette Field in case he returns there.
He's not going back there, trust me.
Is this what you lost, McGee?
Where'd you find them, Director?
They were found at RFK Stadium.
Police turned them in to the I.G.'s office.
I don't know what to say.
Gibbs, you know about this? Yeah.
I'll deal with it later. Been a little busy around here, Leon.
Anything on Lieutenant Keith?
No, nothing on his location. Ducky profiled him;
we have a theory.
All right, let's go. We're briefing the others in five minutes.
Duck. Yeah, I need you in MTAC.
Told you you'd find 'em.
Yeah, in the Inspector General's office.
Ooh. I'm completely screwed.
Well.
Air traffic controllers are on full alert.
We haven't had any sightings. What's the plane's range?
Just under 450 nautical miles.
So if Keith is planning to go any further, he'll have to stop to refuel.
All general aviation airports east of the Mississippi have been notified.
And what do we know about Lieutenant Keith?
We've profiled him. Dr. Mallard?
Lieutenant Keith was bullied as a youth and looked to naval aviation to turn his life around.
Unfortunately, he washed out.
That made him depressed.
And rather than seeking professional help, he self-medicated.
We believe that he quit, cold-turkey, to pass his FAA medical exam, and to get his civilian pilot's license.
An abrupt cessation of medication of that type could most definitely lead to episodes of delusion and paranoia.
That altered state, combined with low self-esteem and rejection-- well, most likely he's seeking revenge.
Revenge against whom?
We're aware of two possibilities: the high school, where he was bullied, or Whiting Field, where he washed out.
And both have been alerted.
We can't limit ourselves to those two targets.
Could be anywhere.
So, how'd it go with the adoption lawyer?
Uh, okay.
He had a problem with one of the items on our résumé.
What? Well, Breena's a mortician;
I'm a medical examiner-- we both work with dead people-- and, uh, the lawyer seemed to think that that might be kind of a turn-off for a young woman putting her baby up for adoption.
But, uh, you know, I think it'll be fine.
I'm feeling really optimistic. You should be, because as soon as they get to know you two, they're gonna love you.
Thank you for saying that.
Hey, McGee.
Hey, McGee. Well, I got my creds back.
Great!
Where were they?
Someone found them at RFK.
I.G. investigation to follow.
I could end up getting time on the beach.
Or worse.
McGee, oh, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I feel totally responsible. I begged you to go to that concert with me.
Abby, it's not your fault.
Oh, God. Now it's just ruined what would have gone down in history as the most epic night ever.
Have you seen Twitter?
The Sterile Puppets have now gone viral.
Oh, yeah. I heard they passed one million followers.
What?
How good a friend of yours is the drummer?
Why?
Think he'd do you a favor?
Will you slow down, McGee? I do not understand a word you are saying.
In English.
There's a way of finding the plane if it's flying under the radar.
Social networking, Gibbs.
Twitter. Abby's got a friend who's in a band.
And right now, every single one of their tweets is being followed by hundreds of thousands of fans.
We post a picture of Keith's plane and ask the group's fans to be on the lookout.
And if anyone sees it, then we tell them to tweet the location with the hashtag "FindThisPlane."
What's a hashtag?
Thousands of Sterile Puppets fans will be on the lookout for this plane.
Hashtag "this could work," boss.
Go.
Well, we got our first hit.
It's from Hopewell, Virginia.
Admiral, sending you the coordinates now.
I'll alert NORAD.
Here we go.
ATC's tried to make contact.
Keith isn't answering.
Might have the radios turned off.
Transponders, too. We're not getting any radar hits.
Another tweet.
You know, the last time we heard from Keith, it was on the UNICOM frequency for Lafayette Field.
Can we transmit on that frequency?
It'll take a minute.
We've scrambled two Hornets from Oceana to make an intercept.
Armed?
Yes, but we can't bring the plane down over a populated area.
We're getting a lot of tweets-- he's flying a zigzag course.
We got another.
He's skirting around towns.
We've got a video attached.
That's brilliant.
Whose idea was it to track the plane on Twitter?
I know where he's headed.
The Benjamin Franklin just left; it's still in the bay.
I'm monitoring the fighter pilots' transmissions.
They're closing in.
Put it on a speaker.
Target has crossed the shoreline and is less than one minute from the Benjamin Franklin.
We're circling back. We're circling back.
Several of Keith's aviation classmates are on board for their first deployment.
Lieutenant Robbins-- the woman that Keith's been trying to get in contact with all week.
The ultimate blow to his ego.
She gets to fly attack fighters, and he doesn't.
Have NORAD/NORTHCOM alert the ship. 5,000 personnel, over 80 aircraft and a $6 billion ship.
That's a hell of a statement.
He's never gonna get near it; it's protected by state-of-the-art air-and-surface defense systems.
He's on a suicide mission.
Admiral, does the Benjamin Franklin have permission to shoot down a civilian target?
The ship has the right of self-defense.
This is the T.A.O.
Now set General Quarters.
Now set General Quarters.
Low, slow flyer incoming starboard side.
Low, slow flyer incoming starboard side.
All right, boss, you got the UNICOM frequency.
Lieutenant Keith. This is NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.
The Benjamin Franklin has locked on to you with their weapons.
Lieutenant?
It doesn't have to end this way.
You don't understand.
I need to do this.
No, you don't.
To hurt Dana Robbins and others on board doesn't solve a damn thing.
You'll never reach the ship.
Turn around.
We'll help you.
Missile systems are ready to fire.
Air-to-air on final approach. Target's painted.
Weapons hot.
Lieutenant Keith, you will be fired upon.
Civilian plane is executing a left-hand turn.
Confirming, civilian pilot is turning away from carrier.
Lieutenant Keith, ATC will give you vectors for a safe landing.
It's too late.
Civilian aircraft has exploded.
Repeat, civilian aircraft has exploded.
Get some sleep, guys.
Thanks, boss.
Hey, Eugene.
Need something?
I'm here for Special Agent McGee.
You know why I'm here.
I'm heading up the I.G. investigation.
Lost credentials are a very serious offense, especially when they are not immediately reported.
Hey. We've had a long couple of days, you know?
I need you to come with me.
Hang on.
Agent McGee isn't going anywhere.
Director?
Agent McGee and the rest of his team's presence has just been requested at the White House.
His clever strategy just saved countless lives and a multibillion-dollar weapons system.
Yeah, we'll get back to you on that, Eugene.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.
How many times I gotta tell you? I don't do water-filled.
Well, because-- at best, they leak, and at worst, you get black mold, that's why.
Yeah.
Yeah, you got some, uh, buckwheat-fill you want to unload, I could trade a case of corduroy pillows.
They're great for making headlines. Get it?
Head lines?
Pillow humor.
Let me call you back, all right?
♪ NCIS 11x04 ♪ Anonymous Was a Woman Original air date on October 15, 2013
Not smart.
Tony catches you snooping, he'll... You know what?
I don't even want to get inside his head to guess.
I wasn't snooping.
I-I-I wasn't. I wasn't snooping.
I just came up, uh, for a signature from Agent DiNozzo and something on his desk caught my eye. Yeah?
Something on my desk ever catch your eye?
I'm sorry, is this a trick question?
Jimmy, we need to respect each other's privacy. I'm surprised at you.
I know, it's just I couldn't help myself.
Tony's not the kind of guy that writes a handwritten note.
And who's Jessica?
Tony says that she's a wonderful person and she deserves...
"Nothing but happiness.
I'm incredibly sorry for..." For what?
He doesn't say.
That's because it's not done. And it's none of your business. Jim.
Tim. I'm a little surprised, snooping at my desk.
Particularly you, James Palmer.
I'm very angry with you, and I will get more angry in five, four, three...
What?
Like, four years ago. No comment.
What are you, in some kind of 12-step program for recovering misogynists?
These past few weeks have been... interesting, haven't they?
It's just got me thinking about the choices that we make and the people, you know, that we let in or don't let in and...
Any more questions?
Yeah, what'd you do with the real Tony?
Maybe this is the real Tony.
Grab your gear.
Excuse me?
Who let you out of the polygraph room?
Agent Gibbs.
He called and asked me to help you two collect evidence at your crime scene.
We don't have a crime scene.
You do now.
But you don't collect evidence.
Well, the times they are a-changing, boys.
That's the third person in the last week Gibbs has had tag along with us.
Almost makes me think he doesn't trust us by ourselves.
The store owner who leased out the apartment says her name is Patricia Moreno.
Officers responding to the 911 found this and called us.
Thanks.
It's worse than we thought.
She's applying for a full-time position.
Criminal Investigator. Gibbs is conducting the preliminary review.
What's the plan?
She's not going to be as easy to chase away as the others.
Listen, we can't let Gibbs know that she annoys us.
He'll think we feel threatened.
Which he'll like.
The owner see anything?
No, he leased her the apartment two-and-a-half years ago, sold Sergeant Moreno a pillow...
Then barely saw her again.
Says she kept mostly to herself.
We overheard your interview.
It was very well done.
Really?
How so?
Well, um...
See, it had all of the, uh... Oop, look, there's Ducky.
Yeah, the first recorded use of a pillow was in 7,000 B.C.
Of course, back then, only the wealthy could afford such luxury.
And now look at what 30 bucks can get you.
Oh, I've always wanted a body pillow.
You done shopping, Palmer?
Well, actually, I have a buckwheat knee pillow on hold.
Yeah, you see, the interesting thing about buckwheat is that...
Well, never mind.
Oh, hello.
Hello.
What have we here?
A mess.
Oh, dear God.
This is clearly the result of some kind of acid.
And since I doubt she would have sat still for it, probably dispensed post-mortem.
Could make the cause of death difficult to determine,
- especially if it was head trauma.
- Yeah. Perhaps the point.
Well, let's get this young lady back before we speculate further on how she died.
We can speculate on why, Duck.
Nothing appears to be missing... which suggests this wasn't a robbery.
McGee, where was she assigned?
Nowhere.
Sergeant Moreno died in Afghanistan almost three years ago.
Well... then who the hell is she?
The real Sergeant Moreno was killed by an I.E.D. in Afghanistan three years ago.
Her body was sent back through Dover and buried in her Kansas hometown.
Best we can tell, somewhere along the ride home, her military I.D. was stolen and then used by whoever this is to create a new identity.
The imposter used the I.D. to get her credit card, driver's license, even an Amazon Prime account.
Same height, same build.
How'd the imposter get the I.D.?
We confirmed that it was sent home with Sergeant Moreno's possessions after she was killed.
But Susan spoke to the family, and they said it never arrived.
She's asking around, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
Wouldn't hold my breath? Why?
He means that Susan's a polygraph lady, not really a people person.
But we love her.
We think she's great, so... we're cool with it.
You're cool with what?
It's obvious you're looking to hire a replacement.
Motive?
I don't know, maybe you think we need the help.
Three's a magic number?
Who knows?
But we don't need anyone else, boss. And we don't want anyone, either.
I was talking about the murder.
But if you two feel threatened...
Not threatened.
No. No, no, no, no, no.
What's the motive? !
Right.
One of the neighbors said the victim was working as a maid at a nearby motel.
A lot of drug deals going on around there.
At least a few homicides a year.
We're thinking maybe she saw something that got her killed.
DiNozzo, motel.
McGee, find out if Ducky has decontaminated the body.
Who is she?
Find out!
Hey, Abby.
Ducky said you pulled some prints on our Jane Doe.
Any luck?
Luck.
Is that what you think happens in here?
No, I just meant...
It's Tuesday, so no backtracking.
Our victim's fingers were too badly burned for a positive I.D.
However, I did identify what chemical was used.
Hydrofluoric acid is its name, and dissolving skin is its game.
Too bad it's readily available as a wheel cleaner in pretty much every auto-parts store.
However, I did have some "luck" with the victim's necklace.
There is DNA on here, which could belong to the killer, so stay tuned.
But I learned something interesting about the stone itself.
It's a lapis lazuli, mined almost exclusively in Afghanistan.
And on the back there's an inscription.
"To Nadira."
What language is that?
It's Pashto. Also out of Afghanistan.
So now we have a country of origin.
Yeah, and we might have more, because Tony just emailed me a job application from a motel where she worked.
She filled this out last year.
She used her Sergeant Moreno identity.
Yeah.
Whoa!
Look who she has listed as her "In Case of Emergency."
Leyla Shakarji.
Isn't that...
Mike Franks' daughter-in-law.
Motel manager didn't have much to say about the victim except she showed up on time and worked hard.
It was a dead end. Gibbsy!
Hey, hey.
Come on, I got you.
Getting big.
Are you coming over?
Can we play Twister again?
Oh, we'll see. Let me talk to your mom for a minute.
Go and play on the swings, Amira. I'll be with you in a moment.
Why do I have a feeling this is not a social call?
I want to ask you about a case.
Of course.
Anything.
You know her?
No.
Leyla, she put you down as her emergency contact on a job application.
Has there been an emergency?
Yeah, she was murdered.
How?
I only met her a few times.
Mike introduced us.
He asked me to look out for her when he was gone.
Who is she?
I don't know.
How did Mike know her?
He wouldn't say.
And I never saw her again after he died.
He must have told you something about her.
He didn't tell me anything. And I didn't push it.
You know as well as I do, when Mike asks you to do something, it's better not to ask too many questions.
I'm sorry, I wish I could tell you more.
Come for dinner soon?
What was Mike Franks into, boss?
How's it coming?
Slow.
I could stop smoking and buy you some more time, but don't know if my lungs could take the shock.
What is that?
German Renaissance?
Just give me something flowery. I like flowers.
Anything else?
Actually, I... need another favor.
Hey. Come on.
It's okay.
Come on.
Gibbs, this is Elina.
I need to leave her with you for a few days.
Excuse me? !
Oh, I bet you heard it just fine.
Don't worry, she speaks less English than you do Pashto.
Mike... this is not a hotel.
I'm right in the middle of a case.
I know. There's no one else I can trust.
It's... it's like that.
All right... all right... but I... but I got...
No questions!
I can't just take in a teenage girl, no questions asked.
You come to me all the time for help, probie.
Now I'm coming to you.
I need help.
Is it me, or did it seem like Leyla was holding out on us?
I know she's almost family but... wouldn't be the first time.
Plus, anytime you add Mike Franks to the mix, anything's possible.
She could be Mike Franks' daughter... girlfriend, maybe.
Although, that's kind of creepy.
Almost as creepy as you playing Twister.
Something on your mind, boss?
Yeah.
I got it.
McGee. You're on speaker. No bad-mouthing the boss.
What? ! I've never...
What do you got, McGee?
Um, we got a hit on the DNA from our victims' necklace.
His name is Farshad Sarabi. He emigrated from Afghanistan ten years ago.
He have a record?
Just a history of domestic violence.
"Just"?
He just happens to work at an auto parts store, which just happens to sell hydrofluoric acid.
Put out a BOLO; get a warrant to search his place.
You got it, boss.
Bye.
Sure you don't want to talk about it?
Guess that means you don't want any fries, either.
Hmm? No. No.
Mike should be here soon.
He told me to meet him here.
Mike... good.
Mike good.
Depends on the day. Hm.
But he does have his moments.
Where are your parents?
Your mother? Your father?
Sold me.
To man.
What man?
Hu-Hu-Husband.
Old.
L-Like you.
It's okay.
It is all right.
Acid attacks were all the rage in 19th century Europe.
It wasn't until acid shortages in World War II that they started to decline. See?
There's a bright side to everything.
Even global war.
What do you got, Duck?
Well, contrary to Mr. Palmer's crime-scene speculation, acid was not used to cover up the cause of death.
No, it was the cause of death.
In high enough doses, hydrofluoric acid can cause cardiac arrest.
You're saying her death was an accident?
The goal was to maim this woman, Jethro.
And if she died, she died.
We may have stumbled on an honor killing.
I'm sorry-- a what?
An honor killing, Mr. Palmer, is when a relative is murdered for bringing dishonor on the family.
It's a brutal custom.
Women can be killed for refusing an arranged marriage;
for infidelity... or just for being a lovesick teenager.
Being caught kissing a boy.
It's a misnomer, if I ever heard one.
I mean, there is no honor involved.
Whoever did this is a stone-cold killer.
Who's about to feel the pain.
BOLO came back on our suspect, boss.
Rockville PD's got him.
Okay.
So what are you doing here?
Leaving.
I sincerely hope you put the screws to this one, Jethro.
Will do.
Well, this may help you with your interrogation.
Our victim has scars from a lifetime of beatings.
She was persecuted simply for being a woman.
See you soon.
What's going on?
Why the fake I.D.?
About a year ago, some former-- come up to me because they had a 12-year-old Afghan girl who they were helping smuggle into the U.S.
Okay, stop.
I can't hear any more of that.
You need to.
This girl had been raped repeatedly by her uncle.
When she finally went to the police, they arrested her.
For what?
For being outside without a male escort.
Without her uncle, for Pete's sake.
I was just supposed to help with the one.
But when I met the kid-- this sweet, innocent child-- it ain't something you let go.
So I hooked up with this group that runs women's shelters in Kabul.
I kind of run their underground railroad.
You know, helping them relocate their hard cases.
Mike, I can hear the "but" that's coming a mile away.
But with all this border fence talk, it's getting to be harder and harder to get the girls in.
Even harder to get them set up with the fake I.D.'s.
What do you want?
I need you to put a space "A" travel request in the system.
Authorizing military transport from Kabul to El Salvador.
This is for six people.
Six refugees.
I'll take care of everything else.
That's all you need to know.
I can't wait for Gibbs to give this guy hell.
Same here.
You'll... have to settle for me.
You?
Why you?
Gibbs wants me to talk to the suspect.
Look... this isn't taking pictures at a crime scene, this is an interrogation. Yeah.
If only I had experience asking people questions and trying to figure out if they were lying.
And the investigator job I want is in San Diego.
We are gonna miss you.
I'm sure.
Now, let's get started.
We found a list of names in the suspect's apartment. All Afghan, all women.
Each name is linked the name of a deceased servicewoman.
We think the Afghan girls are using them as fake identities, just like our victim did.
She's on the list too-- crossed off.
So are two others.
This is a hit list.
She's pissing him off, Tony.
How do I look?
You look stupid.
Like a painted clown.
Prefer something more... like... this?
She was living in the U.S., hiding under a stolen identity when you somehow found out what it was, tracked her down and killed her.
That about right?
I assume... that's the plan for everyone on your list.
List?
I don't know what you're talking about, list?
Okay, cut the bull--
We have hydrofluoric acid in your trunk, your handwriting on a hit list, and your DNA at the crime scene.
I've not only got you dead to rights on this one, I'm gonna make it my life's mission to pin these other two on you.
You're here 'cause I just need to know one thing. I need to know why.
Can't stand that women are smarter than men, yeah?
Or maybe it's 'cause we see you at your weakest and most vulnerable.
Don't talk to me that way.
They brought shame and dishonor to their families.
They were punished in accordance to God's law.
Is that who you work for?
I provide a service to those who need it.
Where did you get this list?
It does not matter where.
What matters is we have the names they're using to hide in this country.
We will find them.
You may have been able to stop me, but someone else will come for them.
All these women were smuggled into the US and given fake identities?
By whom?
It's not our priority right now.
Who has been leaking these new identities to those hit men?
You think it's someone here in Afghanistan?
It's why I'm calling you.
You are the liaison to the only UN women's rights group in the country.
If these are honor killings, the girls' families probably got together to hire your hit man, which means any of a thousand people could be the source.
The targets are all on this same list. They've got to have something in common.
They do.
My records show that at one time or another, they all stayed at the same women's shelter outside Kabul.
I know it well.
Okay, let's start there. Prepare a rack.
I'll be there in 18 hours.
You going to Afghanistan, boss?
You just got back from the Middle East.
I'm sure they can handle this.
Here we are.
Noor Women's Shelter.
Oh, it looks more like a bomb shelter.
They're lucky to have this.
They get zero support from the community.
That's putting it mildly, Tom.
The locals think women's shelters are fronts for brothels, which is why they're all run by foreign NGOs.
You must be Agent Gibbs.
Catherine Tavier.
I manage this shelter.
Well, let's talk inside before someone thinks you're customers and shoot at you.
The girls don't know about Nadira.
They don't speak English.
Are you sure it was her?
You tell us.
How did her family find her?
You really think one of Nadira's family members had her killed?
They're the only ones who'd care enough.
If you can forgive my choice of words.
But even if you find out who it was, you'll never get a conviction.
Not here.
There are women in danger. Women that you know.
Were you aware that after Nadira left here, she was smuggled into the US and living under a false identity?
On the record, no.
Off the record, I may have heard a thing or two.
Though, sadly, that conduit to the US has closed.
Nadira was found because someone leaked her real identity.
We're bringing those women into protective custody, but to really protect them, we're gonna need to find out who's leaking their cover names.
I'm the only one who knew them all, aside from the girls here.
We were the only ones who could be trusted.
Gonna need to talk to them.
There is simple no way they would have shared that information.
They know what it could mean.
Still gonna need to talk to them.
Lieutenant Gorman and I can translate.
Yeah.
McGee, go with the lieutenant.
It's nice to finally meet.
Mike Franks spoke very highly of you.
I need you to put a travel request in the system.
It's for six people.
Six refugees.
She says she doesn't know who would leak any names and she would die before doing so herself.
Please tell her thank you.
You get anything?
Yeah, some of the most horrible stories I've ever heard.
I tell you, though, I got my eye on that girl in the bottom right bunk.
She's been squirrely ever since we got here.
Oh, there's Tony.
Maybe he's had better luck.
Ah, finally.
Ladies, please, can you keep it down.
This is long-distance. What do you got, DiNozzo?
I have a headache, boss.
Susan and I got all the women from the hit list.
She's looking into safe houses, and, uh,
I got a call into immigration.
Why?
Well, because all these women are here illegally, boss.
We're not sending them home, DiNozzo.
They're not safe here, Tony.
You call DHS and you request temporary asylum. That'll keep them busy for a while.
Okay, that's why we call you the boss.
Mor means mother.
Her daughter was sent to America first.
The mother was to follow. Unfortunately, that never happened when Mike Franks died.
It's the first time they've seen each other in two years.
Tony, I'll call you back.
Wait, McGee...
Boss, you see anything?
No.
Everybody's okay.
It's been a rough week.
This is nothing.
Though, this late probably means it's going to be a rough night.
Have you lost all shred of human decency?
This is not a game. This is life or death to these women!
You don't know that.
The hell I don't!
These girls are in danger.
Even in the shelters.
And when the US finished its military pull-out, it's game over for them.
Look at them.
I'm a federal agent, and I cannot lend material support to a human smuggling operation.
When did you start caring about the rules?
My rules.
Yeah?
Which ones? Rule ten.
Never get personally involved on a case.
Rule 14, bend the line, don't break it.
Human smuggling breaks it.
You already got involved once.
Or don't you remember how Leyla and Amira got here?
How do you choose, Mike?
Huh? Who do you pick?
You can start it, but how do you stop it?
You're not God.
He's sitting this one out.
I can't do it.
Can't do it.
Easy, easy. You'll break the frame.
That's all of them, boss.
You find the leak?
No.
Think maybe Catherine was right.
These women would never sell each other out.
Girl I was talking to was almost beaten to death by her father for kissing a boy.
The one in the back right ran away from an arranged marriage when she was 13.
13, boss.
Yeah.
Yeah, I get it.
On the other hand, if they're the only ones that had the info, the leak has to be here.
Yes, sir. We have to leave.
Now.
What's going on? My office just got intel that a group of locals is planning something after sundown tonight.
That's almost now.
Planning what?
It sounds like another bonfire. They're usually a little too close for comfort.
Well, we need to call the police.
Not a good idea.
They usually bring the gasoline.
My office has already dispatched an urgent request to any UN forces in the area, but we've been ordered back to base.
Maybe your girls can find someplace else to go as a precaution.
Well, you know as well as I do, they don't have any place else to go.
We wait for backup.
Agent Gibbs, we're prohibited by our rules of engagement from lending any support in these situations.
It's very tricky geopolitically.
We have our orders.
We need to leave.
I'm staying.
Look, this isn't the first time we've gotten intel like this.
The girls will be fine.
But if we stay, it is guaranteed to turn violent.
We need to leave now.
Come on, McGee.
Get out of here.
Boss...
Now.
Go.
Thank you for flying NCIS Airlines.
We know you have a choice when it comes to government agencies, and we hope you can discover the joys of a U.S. passport.
Or green card.
Don't worry. Everything's going to be okay.
You're welcome.
Tony DiNozzo, friend of the ladies.
Tony, we've got a problem.
We've got intel that there might be an attack on the shelter and orders to bug out, but...
Let me guess.
Actually, I don't even need to.
Agent McGee, we have our orders. We need to leave now.
Then go.
I'm staying.
What is it with these guys from NCIS?
- What do you need?
- Well, supposedly, there's reinforcements on the way, but...
I'll see what we have in the area.
All right, when you're done, go by MTAC, check satellite coverage on our location.
Maybe you can see something that we can't.
Okay. On it.
Be careful, Tim.
Yeah.
Wet some blankets.
We can stuff them under the doors if we need to get the smoke out.
Rear is secure.
Anything else I can help with, boss?
I.D. all lines of sight.
Cover all approaches, McGee.
You know, I don't see why we all just don't take a walk around the block till the cavalry arrives.
It's too risky. This could all be just a gambit to get us to leave the shelter.
We're safer inside.
McGee, ammo.
Got a full mag in my SIG. Two extra in my pack.
You have access to any weapons?
I'm not so fond of guns, but I've been keeping one around.
Don't shoot yourself.
Everybody down.
McGee.
I got nothing.
Tony, it's a bad time right now.
Just got off the horn with a U.N. commander. They're sending a team your way.
Well, they better be quick. We just got fired on.
Satellite's coming online.
Okay, there we go.
We got five bogeys inbound, McGee.
On foot, moving slow.
I don't see 'em.
I got 'em.
Are you still there, McGee?
We're here, Tony.
They've got Molotov cocktails.
They're not planning a bonfire.
Well, you're not going to talk your way out of this, and if you start shooting, you're going to have a mob on your hands.
The locals aren't big fans of Americans.
Outside Kabul, there has been yet another car bombing.
The target this time was a women's shelter run by a French group called Les Femmes Déterminée.
Six Afghan women were reportedly killed during the blast.
The only survivor was a French national, Catherine Tavier, who ran the shelter.
I could've got them out, probie.
Some of them were just kids.
We can't run. We can't negotiate. We can't fight.
So what are we going to do?
All right, they're coming, McGee.
We stand.
Which means what exactly?
These guys are bullies.
You stand up to bullies, right McGee?
Cover me.
What?
Boss, you're going out there?
McGee, what is he doing?
He's doing what he does, Tony.
Where's our backup?
Working on it.
Well, work faster.
He's going to get himself killed.
I think I may die of a heart attack first.
Grid 097...
Where's our air and ground support?
We need it now. We're out of time.
There's too many of them.
If I shoot one of them, Gibbs is dead.
He's already dead.
What's going on? Sitrep, McGee.
You've been on the other side of that look, Tony.
Take a guess.
Hey, gunny... got a call you needed some backup?
Thank you.
I can't believe it.
That was incredible.
Boss, you saved the shelter.
For now, McGee.
What about tomorrow?
Agent Gibbs took quite a risk with what he did.
That's how he rolls.
I heard they found the leak.
Yeah. One of the girls who moved out of the shelter was threatened.
She had no choice.
Well, sometimes it's a pain in the ass.
Why do you think Gibbs did it?
I don't know.
Because he likes breaking rules, maybe.
I hope he has a better answer for Immigration.
'Cause he's going to have some explaining to do after this.
Mike would be so proud of you.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
But he lives there.
- Well...
You're acting like a child.
Martha, please... if you care about me at all, just let me figure it out on my own.
Help! Help me!
Just drive.
Thank you.
♪ NCIS 11x05 ♪ Once a Crook Original air date on October 22, 2013
What are you doing here?
Working, Tim-- trying to power through these ROI's.
At 7:00 in the morning?
Yeah. Someone's got to.
Once again, who are you, and what have you done with the real Tony?
Oh, no, I got up early. Gave me a chance to hit the gym, do a little shopping.
Then I got some breakfast.
Exactly how early were you up?
Technically, I-I haven't slept.
At all?
You want to talk about it?
I feel we just did.
You know, you've been different these past few weeks, Tony.
How long?
Well, that's kind of a personal question, Tim, but since it's you asking...
No, how long since you've slept?
Uh... a few days-- it's not a problem.
A few days is a big problem-- the body needs rest, Tony.
You kidding?
I've never felt more alert, more in control; I'm totally on my game.
Feelin' good, man!
- On your feet, DiNozzo.
- Aah! Sorry, boss. I didn't see you coming.
I'm just getting my work shape spaceship... space... ship...
Work in progress.
Do it later.
Got a dead sailor outside of Baltimore. - Come on.
- I need coffee.
Sleep deprivation affects high-level cognitive functions, cardiovascular health, circulation...
Just Googled that on the ride over, didn't you?
Side effects include increased risk of stroke, memory loss, hallucinations, Tony.
What's your point?
Should you really be carrying a loaded weapon right now?
Look, I got some sleeping pills at home- - I can bring them in.
You trying to make me all Dorothy Dandridge?
Forget about it.
Coffee beans. Turbo Tweak.
Body is my temple.
Holy... I need some antacid.
Do you re...
Sorry, boss.
Rather a bucolic place to die, wouldn't you say, Jethro?
Depends on the cause, Duck.
Decidedly less bucolic, I'm afraid.
Single gunshot wound to the back, as far as I can see.
Preceded by a brutal battle.
He put up a fight.
It was the environment. These aren't defensive wounds on his hands.
They're from the trees and the brush that he undoubtedly had to struggle through to get here.
Nah, he was running from somebody.
Victim is First Class Petty Officer Wells.
24 years old. He's a crypto tech.
Just returned from a tour in Afghanistan where he was assigned to a security post.
Park rangers discovered his body at 6:00 a.m.
Rollins Hotel.
It's in Baltimore. Expensive, too.
I'm wondering how an enlisted man could afford it.
Check it out.
Ah, DiNozzo, what are you doing?
Trees?
Looky-loos.
They're all dressed for something-- hiking, running, bird-watching.
Yeah, except?
The tall guy in the green hoodie with the black work boots.
He's not dressed for anything.
Where?
My six. Your 12.
He was there.
Well, get him back.
Hey!
I know you.
Come back! NCIS!
Stop!
Sorry. He disappeared.
He was...
Wait a minute.
Are you okay, DiNozzo?
Yeah, of course.
It's... the guy was standing right here, you know?
I was just...
"Choward's Scented Gum""
That mean something to you?
Yeah. It means McGee's right.
I'm starting to see things.
Hi.
Oh. Hey. Delilah.
Why are you here?
Oh, haven't you heard?
Transfer just came in.
It's official-- I'm joining the team.
Careful, Delilah. Tony's operating on a serious sleep deficit.
His, uh, neurotransmitters aren't processing humor right now.
I'm just kidding, Tony.
But you should really see a doctor if you can't sleep.
Prolonged insomnia can lead to an early death.
Promise?
Short temper's also a symptom?
Why are you here, Delilah?
- I, uh... - DoD sent her over once they heard about Petty Officer Wells' murder.
Why is the Department of Defense interested in a low-level CT?
Petty Officer Wells was not just any crypto tech.
He was an expert in communications network defense with top-level security clearance.
What kind of intel did he have access to?
That's classified, Tony.
Seriously?
No, I just always wanted to say that.
I don't go out into the field much.
It's not his access DoD was worried about, it's the encryption codes he utilized on a daily basis.
Some of the best the military has.
Wells was an asset.
And he was supposed to report for duty at NAS Point Mugu in California this morning.
Ooh, could I have a piece?
I love grape.
Scented grape gum?
You ever heard of the food pyramid?
Gum's not grape, it's violet.
And what's this?
A bag of high-end cellular telephones that just happens to match a description of a truckload that was hijacked last night at the shipyards?
I didn't do anything.
Then why do you have these?
I'm holding them for a friend.
What's your name?
Anton Markin.
Well, Anton Markin, what we're looking at here is a class-two felony, which means an "atta boy" for me, and a little prison time for you.
What was Wells doing in Baltimore?
He was living it up in a thousand-dollar-a-night suite at the Rollins Hotel.
On whose dime?
Bill was paid for with an electronic check-- I'm still tracing it.
I searched his room, found $10,000 cash in the room safe along with P.O. Wells' laptop.
Sent the computer down to Abby along with the hotel security footage.
Actually, I'm going to need to access that computer ASAP.
Could be compartmented information on it, "Eyes Only" kind of stuff.
You want to try and take it from Abby?
I would like to see that.
Um... that's okay. I can wait.
Suit yourself.
What do you got, Abbs?
Depends on who's asking.
Did she send you?
She did! I knew it!
Delilah!
She already told me that I can't log on to Petty Officer Wells' laptop without her, Gibbs. Abby...
But I've got a lot of work to do here, Gibbs, so she's gonna have to wait her turn.
Abbs, Abbs, she's just doing her job.
I know.
I am not stalling for personal reasons, Gibbs.
I just need time to put it back together.
What happened?
I didn't have permission to log on, but no one said anything about dissection.
This computer has been suspicious since it came in here, Gibbs.
It's supposed to be a top-of-the-line Altstar laptop, but... I noticed some details on the casing that didn't match the manufacturer's specs.
The edges are all unevenly grounded, and, I mean, the motherboard, you can look for yourself.
I mean, come on.
It all looks like computer guts.
The circuitry is abysmal.
This is substandard workmanship, it's... shoddy hardware.
This-this computer is a liar, Gibbs. It's Chinese.
I mean, well, most computers are Chinese, but this one is claiming to be an Altstar laptop, and it is not-- it is an imposter.
There is spyware implanted on that chip.
That's like a back door into the computer, accessible from anywhere in the world.
We're talking about espionage here.
Do I seem okay to you?
Markedly better than the last occupant of that table.
It's just, I can't sleep, Ducky.
I've... Ever since...
Uh, her absence is difficult for all of us, Tony.
I didn't say...
You didn't have to.
All I know is I'm starting to see things.
People... who aren't even there.
Well, you're talking to someone who has conversations with the dead.
I found a piece of gum at the crime scene today-- brought me back to a case I hadn't thought about in... 15 years.
Small details can unleash powerful memories.
Proust's madeleine.
A single bite conjured up a seven-volume novel.
Memory's not my problem.
I'm afraid I'm going Cuckoo's Nest.
Well, if you feel you're losing your grip, simply stick to what you know is real-- like this victim-- and, ah! The bullet fragment that I have finally dislodged.
And then... think about the people who are still here, and who are depending on you.
Tony, I went through Petty Officer Wells' cell phone records.
He received a dozen calls in the last few days from a woman named Amy Linden.
She's a private defense contractor.
I traced the payment for Wells' hotel and travel back to her.
She also spent several years working for Chinese technology companies.
If Wells was a spy, she could've been his handler.
Gibbs wants us to go pick her up.
Tony?
Did you hear me?
Hi, boss.
Sure you're okay?
You keep asking.
Well, I'm still waiting for an answer. I'm fine. I heard everything McGee said-- go pick up Amy Linden.
No, no, no. You stay put.
Pull it together.
McGee, come on. You're with me.
Drive safely.
Hello?
Tony.
Abby. Is she still there?
Who?
Wha...?
Where? Delilah. Is she still in the bullpen?
I don't see her.
What do you need?
Oh, good. I just wanted to make sure that the coast was clear before I gave you this.
It's a DNA hit on your violet gum.
I think we hit the jackpot here.
This guy's a fugitive-- he's wanted for stabbing a Russian gangster in Baltimore a bunch of years ago.
He could totally be our killer. And that means you're not seeing things.
And you're not crazy.
I mean, not that...
not that I... thought you were crazy, or that, um...
McGee told me that you're seeing things, 'cause he... he didn't...
This some kind of safe house?
Does it look like a safe house?
It looks like where you beat confessions out of suspects.
It's my apartment.
I haven't had time to decorate.
It's gonna take more than throw pillows.
Oh, no. Coffee's for closers.
Oh, come on, man, I've been in a holding cell all night.
And the reason you're not on a bus to lockup is because of me.
You're welcome, by the way.
I did everything you asked, Officer DiNozzo.
I gave you the name of the guy from the truck robbery, but I got to go.
I have a job at a bakery-- they're not gonna understand why I'm late.
Here's the thing: the name you gave me--
Viktor Khartov-- his dad, Ivan, basically runs organized crime in East Baltimore.
Ivan runs a tight organization.
No outsiders. Makes it virtually impossible to infiltrate.
No!
Let me finish.
You don't have to. You're gonna ask me to be a rat;
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna do it.
No. Truck driver's dead.
Viktor shot him, dumped the body.
I know you were there that night.
Yeah, but all I... all I did was drive, and I waited in the car.
I didn't know he killed a guy.
I didn't know it.
Doesn't matter. Makes you an accessory to a robbery... and a homicide.
Look, I got a sister who depends on me.
Anton, hey, look at me.
You want to take care of your sister, you got to take care of our problem first.
It's your only way out.
Don't move.
Hello, Anton.
How'd you track me down?
Not that hard.
This is the one place in Baltimore you ever felt safe.
I didn't kill that guy.
Which guy?
The one you stabbed to death 15 years ago, or the sailor you shot last night?
The sailor.
Mm. I see.
He was a cryptologist.
Turns out he may have been selling secrets to the Chinese.
So I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation why you were at the crime scene.
There is, actually. But in my experience, the guy with the gun doesn't have to explain himself.
Fair enough. Put the gun down, we'll talk.
I'm not here to have a conversation. I'm here to warn you to stay away.
Or what, you gonna shoot me?
If I have to.
Give me your gun.
No.
What?
No. If you were gonna shoot me, I'd be dead.
You already got one gun;
I'm not giving you another one. So let's move on.
Anton... what are you doing back in Baltimore?
It's complicated.
I can help you.
Last time you tried to help, it cost me my life and my sister. Think I'll pass, thank you.
That's right, your sister, Marie. How's she doing?
Have you been to see her?
Stop asking questions.
Turn around, get on your knees. Now.
Everything's different now.
I'm a federal agent;
I have pull.
Wow. Congratulations.
Heard you got made detective when you threw me under the bus, but federal agent...
I didn't throw you under the bus.
Want to know what my life's been like, hmm?
Living underground, fake names, dead-end job-- it's 15 years of nothing.
Running was your choice, Anton.
None of this was my choice.
Anton!
Anton! Stop!
Tony, where are you?
Never mind. I need a favor, McGee, and it's got to stay between us.
Well, that's gonna be a little tricky, considering we're about to go interview Amy Linden.
I need a current address for Marie Markin.
It's probably in Baltimore. Markin.
Hey, isn't that the last name of the suspect Abby I.D.'d off the violet gum?
Yeah. Get back to me as soon as you can. And listen...
Okay.
Thanks a lot. Bye.
Uh, can I help you, boss?
You got an interview to conduct.
I can't recall anyone named Wells.
Your company paid for his hotel and airfare, gave him $10,000 in cash.
Sorry, not ringing any bells.
We've got a dead Navy cryptologist who might have been selling secrets to the Chinese, and you're the last person to see him alive.
It's from the Rollins Hotel security camera.
Yesterday.
That's him and that's you.
Ring your bell now?
Tell us about Petty Officer Wells.
I wanted him bad.
But not for espionage.
He was an expert cryptologist at the end of his enlistment.
Do you know how valuable that is in the private sector?
I had... three tech companies in a bidding war for him.
You're a headhunter?
Recruitment advisor-- developing former government personnel with specialized skills.
Why all the secrecy?
My business is cutthroat.
If my competitors found out about Wells, they'd have tried to poach him.
And the $10,000 we found in his room?
Signing bonus.
Just a taste, really.
You have no idea the kind of money companies will pay.
How much?
Just... out of curiosity.
Six figures, to start.
The sky's the limit if you have the proper skill set.
You looking to make a transition, Agent McGee?
Stay put.
- Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs!
Abbs, tell me you got something.
Bad juju, Gibbs.
She came down here an hour ago, asking to look at Petty Officer Wells' computer, and she was all "pleas"" and all "thank you""
She brought me this.
She's just trying to be nice.
I know.
It's freaking me out, man.
Ballistics.
I'm working on it.
But the fragments that Ducky sent down are in bad shape.
I'm scanning them in the computer to build a 3-D model-- I'm gonna reconstruct the bullet virtually, upload it into NIBIN, but it's, like, every time I get into it...
Think I found something.
So, I was going through files on Wells' computer when I saw this on his Web browser.
I'm thinking it's some kind of code, unlike any I've ever seen.
That's not code. That's football.
It is?
How can you tell?
It's passing, rushing, receiving, sacks.
It's a player's statistics.
Wells wasn't spying, he was playing fantasy football.
He had a pretty good team, too.
And it looks like he logged into this account an hour before he was shot, using someone else's IP address.
Well, figure out whose.
DiNozzo. Tony, hey, it's me.
I was able to find Marie Markin's place of work-- Rankoff's Bakery.
Mm-hmm. - Oh, you know it?
- Yeah, been there.
Good.
Now, listen, it's your turn.
You need to tell me exactly what's going on, Tony.
Hang up on me?
Boss, is that you?
Who's Marie Markin?
Morning, Officer.
Can I help you?
Owners around? No.
No, my parents aren't here.
How about Anton Markin? He works here, doesn't he?
That depends. On what?
On what he did.
Have you seen him? No.
Supposed to be here a few hours ago.
Means no day off for me.
Where is he exactly?
I don't know.
But if you see him, tell him the help wanted sign goes up tonight.
Don't take it personally.
Milo's not being rude.
Just doesn't trust policemen.
It's a Russian thing.
How about you?
Do I trust policemen?
Do you know Anton?
I should.
He's my brother.
Oh, Marie. I'm Officer DiNozzo.
Yeah, I know who you are.
You shouldn't be here.
'Cause of him?
No. You never know who else might be around.
Look, I just...
I need to find Anton. He's not in trouble.
Come on... Anton's almost always in trouble.
But he's a good person.
I'm sure he is.
But he skipped a meeting with the detective.
That detective treats him like a criminal, and so do you.
Well, technically, Marie...
Technically, he's just trying to do right by me.
You know, it's just the two of us.
Anton dropped out of school to take care of me, keep social services away.
So... yeah, you know, he sold some stuff he shouldn't.
Like anyone else.
Just to get by.
Listen, I'm gonna take care of him.
You better... 'cause no one else ever has.
Yeah, I remember you.
You were that cop who came around to see Marie after that trouble with her brother, right?
It's been a long time.
Yes, it has.
Is Marie here?
No, no, she's not been in for a few days.
You got a home address?
Yeah.
I was surprised, after all these years to see she still worked here.
That's how it is here.
We're Russian.
We look out for each other like family.
Oh, no.
Anton?
Hey, boss.
Got a positive hit on Petty Officer Wells' fingerprints.
Beating he took started here.
Figured he got away, fled toward the park. His attacker followed him.
He finished the job.
Wells served with Marie's husband,
Marine Sergeant Randy Hollister.
They worked the same security post out of Afghanistan.
Hollister was killed a couple weeks ago when his Humvee flipped during a routine patrol.
Wells is paying his respects to the widow?
That's what it looks like.
And there's still no sign of her.
Thanks, boss.
Feels like I got hit by a train.
A little sleep would help.
I'll take what I can get.
Who's Anton?
Informant back when I was in uniform.
Got stuck between the Russian mob and a hard place.
He ended up killing one of the Russians he was informing on.
Skipped town, left his sister Marie to fend for herself.
Anton kill Wells?
He says no.
I think I believe him.
It was just one of those cases. Everything fell apart.
And you still think you can put it back together.
No.
Anton's a stone cold killer.
Stabbed a guy 15 times with a screwdriver.
I want to end this.
If you say so.
What, you think 'cause I went out on my own, I want to save him?
It's my mess.
I just want to bring him in, look him in the eye and figure out what the hell went wrong.
The only reason he's not in custody is he got the drop on me.
Boss, I think I found something.
If you wanted him in custody, DiNozzo, he would be.
Got fingernail scratches and finger smudges on the window.
It's also broken.
Someone trying to escape.
Look at this.
That's Marie's.
Well, then, she's alive.
Or she was.
Sorry, Tony. What I meant...
I know what you meant.
Marie's in trouble, she could be dead, and we still don't know why.
Counterfeit Altstars,
Gibbs. Just like Wells' laptop.
Down to the crappy motherboards and the subpar coding.
Manufactured in China at a fraction of the cost of the genuine article, then sold for retail on the open market.
The stash from Marie's house has a street value of $300,000.
This is not espionage.
No, it's smuggling.
What about the spyware?
That's the one thing we got wrong.
What? No spyware?
Oh, no, there's spyware in all the computers.
We broke the code, too. We can tell you what factory they were made in, what ship they came in on and what date they landed on U.S. soil.
But don't thank me.
This one is Delilah.
Oh, no, no, it was nothing. All I did was break the code on the operating system.
Oh, don't be so modest.
Most people can't do that.
Yeah, but it was your idea, Abby.
I mean, without your...
Oh. What'd you find?
The spyware's American.
Implanted in the computers to track the men who've been smuggling them.
These computers belong to U.S. Customs.
Marie's husband, Sergeant Hollister, had a partner, Jacob Spoke.
Six months ago, Customs raided a warehouse owned by Spoke.
They arrested him and Sergeant Hollister.
Only problem was, they didn't find any of the computers, so, Customs cut Hollister loose.
Not his partner?
No. Spoke had an outstanding warrant for weapons possession.
They locked him up, he was released last week.
Well, maybe he came looking for his share. Took Marie instead.
I checked their finances. Marie Markin and her husband had a joint account with 50 grand in it.
She's got a wanted fugitive for a brother. Her dead husband ran the largest computer smuggling ring in Maryland.
It's worth considering she's in on it, too.
Well, let's find her.
Let's get this thing figured out-- come on.
Already on it, boss. Got an address for a Jake Spoke.
It's a warehouse near Baltimore.
Just waiting for Tony to go pick him up.
What the hell you doing here?
Hiding.
Hiding in my apartment?
Not even you found me.
Well, Detective Price is wondering where you've been.
Detective Price is a jerk.
Yeah, he may be a jerk, but he's the jerk who holds your fate in his hands.
Viktor knows.
He knows I'm working for you.
What did he say?
He's got a job.
Another robbery.
Wants me to drive. I'm supposed to meet tomorrow, go over plans, but...
That's fantastic.
All right. I'll call Detective Price.
We'll set up surveillance. He's gonna kill me.
It's nerves talking. Calm down.
Hey, look in my eyes, Officer DiNozzo.
Viktor Khartov is gonna kill me.
Anton, we're getting close.
All you have to do is go in there, let Viktor hang himself, and you're home free.
How many times have you done this?
Huh? Worked an undercover case, protected an informant?
Detective Price has. And, uh, every other cop on the detail.
Look, I'm gonna go down to the precinct,
I'm gonna set everything up and then I'm gonna come back here, and I'm not taking my eyes off you until Viktor's in cuffs.
You promise me, Officer DiNozzo?
We're in this together, Anton.
I got your back.
You think I feel guilty about Anton and let him get away because of it, huh?
I don't know.
Do you?
He made a run for it.
I... drew on him, but I couldn't pull the trigger.
You would have had him on the ground in two seconds flat.
Taken out a leg, or shot him in the ass, or...
Yeah. You followed your gut.
That hasn't rely been working out... so well for me... lately.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's day number four without sleep, but I can't rely on my instincts any longer.
I was wrong to trust Anton.
Maybe I was wrong about a lot of people.
Are we still talking about the case?
It's so interesting.
No one will say her name.
Have you noticed?
It's like she's dead.
Every time I look at her desk, every time I close my eyes I just feel like I made a mistake.
Like I made... the wrong decision.
Only, it wasn't me who decided.
So, yeah, I'm probably wrong to think Anton's innocent in all this.
I'll trust you any time.
McGee, cover the back.
On it.
I'll hurt you in a thousand different ways... then I'll kill you!
Where the hell is my sister? ! I don't know.
I told you. I didn't take her. You're lying!
Where is she?
Please don't hurt me, man. I'm begging you.
NCIS.
Put the weapon down now.
Back off! I'm not done with him yet!
Listen to him, Anton.
Back off!
Anton... listen to him.
He's not messing around.
Put the gun down.
I'm only asking one more time.
I don't know, man, I swear!
Anton, look at me.
Hey, look at me.
We can end this.
Okay? We'll find Marie.
Together.
I swear to you.
But you got to put the gun down.
It's okay.
Two nights ago, Petty Officer Wells was attacked at Marie Markin's house.
So?
She was abducted.
And?
Where is she?
I don't know.
Look, I don't know who this is, either.
He had one of your counterfeit computers.
Yeah, a lot of people do.
That one's dead.
Are we gonna talk about the guy who tried to kill me?
No!
Where's Marie?
Like I said, no idea. Your fingerprints are all over her house.
I spent time there.
Randy was my partner on the computer thing.
Marie involved in this?
The computers?
No. She didn't know anything about it.
Who do you work for?
I got nothing else to say.
All right?
Lock me up. I'll do the time.
I'm not turning on 'em.
Look, I don't know who you're afraid of, but I promise you, I'm worse.
These guys aren't from around here.
They have their own code, you know?
They don't just kill you.
They make you beg 'em for it.
You scare me, Agent Gibbs. They scare me more.
Gibbs, hi... um, I was gonna knock, but I know that you hate that, but it's really important, and I assume that if it's really important that it would be okay to pull you out,
and this is really important.
Abbs, Abbs...
I'm here. Tell me.
Do you believe in fate?
Abby... Like we're all connected, and we're all a part of some continuous circle?
No.
Oh. Um, well, now maybe you will.
I got a hit in NIBIN on the bullet that we pulled from Petty Officer Wells.
It came from a gun used in a Baltimore truck hijacking 15 years ago.
Tony's old case. Yeah. So, what does it mean?
It means we've been questioning the wrong guy.
Thanks, Abbs.
Ballistics report.
The gun that killed Petty Officer Wells was the same gun in your hijacking case 15 years ago.
This sailor's death,
Marie's abduction, is all about you.
You... killed Ivan Khartov's son, and they still want revenge.
You told me it would be okay, that you had my back.
Come on...
That Marie would be safe. You think this is my fault?
It is your fault!
Really? I'm not the one who stole cell phones, I'm not the one who hijacked a truck, and I'm certainly not the one who stabbed a Russian gangster with a screwdriver.
You weren't there!
You said that you would be there no matter what, and you weren't!
You don't even know what happened.
Then tell me.
So we can get this cleared off the table, tell me what happened that night.
I told you Viktor figured it out.
How? I don't know. I don't know.
But you left to go to the precinct.
An hour later, he shows up at your apartment and drives me to the shipyard.
And all of his guys were there waiting for me. I didn't have a chance to call for help.
And there was a screwdriver in the back of the car.
I didn't have a choice, Tony.
I didn't have a choice.
If it was self-defense, why didn't you come to me afterwards?
It looked so bad.
Oh, God...
What I did to him, to Ivan's son-- if I was lucky, I was going to prison.
But if Ivan got to me...
So, I ran, and I stayed away as long as I could.
And then you came back, 15 years later, for Randy's funeral.
15 years.
I figured, if I could be there for the one day, just the one day that Marie needed me the most.
But they're still after me.
They're still after me.
And they're probably holding her as bait.
I'm gonna need names.
Special Agent DiNozzo.
Closing up, but if you want to grab something to go.
15 years ago, someone told Ivan Khartov that Anton was working with the police.
That someone was you.
I didn't even know Ivan.
That's the wrong answer.
I looked at Ivan's file.
You picked him up from Federal prison when he was released, and then you paid his medical bills when he got sick.
So, you want to try that again?
I'll tell you what-- how about I make us a fresh cup of coffee?
Don't do that.
Back up.
Wow.
The same make and model that killed Wells, which means you're the one who shot wells and abducted Marie.
It figures you're as bad a dirt bag as your buddy Ivan.
No, I was protecting her.
They wanted her dead.
I convinced them to let her live, and then Anton became my responsibility, my debt.
They don't forgive a debt.
But, guys, you got to believe me--
I love Marie; she was never supposed to be hurt.
What went wrong?
She told me Anton was coming to Randy's funeral.
I-I had no choice.
I sent some men to watch her.
And two nights ago, someone shows up, my guys held him there at Marie's house, and when I got there, I saw it wasn't Anton.
No. That was Petty Officer Wells.
That's right, and he ran, and he shouldn't have done that.
Wait. Now you're gonna blame the dead guy for being killed?
Where's Marie?
I can't. Tell us!
No, do you understand what they will do to me?
I don't care. No.
I don't... I don't care at all.
Talk!
Is Marie okay?
Yeah.
She's a little dehydrated, that's all.
The marshals are here to take me back to Baltimore.
I'm sorry... about... the way things went down.
I should've done a better job looking out for you back then.
I made my choices, you made yours. Let's just...
let's just leave it at that.
I don't want to leave it at that.
I want to help.
There's one thing I learned, Tony.
Just 'cause you want it, doesn't mean it's gonna happen.
Tell me about it.
It's funny. Never stops me from trying.
Marie.
Anton.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm fine. I missed you so much.
You and Delilah got a hot date?
Just dinner.
You're welcome to join.
Oh, thanks, but no thanks, Tim.
Not my kind of three-way.
See you tomorrow, Tony.
Good night.
Hey. Go home.
I will, boss.
I just want to make sure Anton gets processed smoothly.
Least I can do.
Then it's off to bed.
Scout's honor.

McGee, I thought we said no mischief-night pranks this year!
Whoa! Nice.
That kind of precision-- whoever did this has some serious skills.
I mean, "Oh, no.
Oh, God, it's awful.
How dare they." So, this wasn't your handiwork?
No.
You're not the one that defiled my lab?
What? No.
What did they do? Someone moved my work table three inches to the right.
Oh, gee, how dare they.
I know.
Whoever did it knows that I would notice if there was even a hair out of place.
We're dealing with a sadistic evil genius.
I think you got half that equation right.
What have we here?
I'm glad to see you took our little conversation about safe agenting seriously, but that's a little overboard, McRibbed.
You've had your fun, Tony;
unwrap it.
Oh, gosh, I'm flattered, but unfortunately, that prophylaxis is not the work of yours truly.
Then whose work is it?
Who knows? The Great Pumpkin?
Headless Horseman? Perhaps the Ghost of Halloween Past?
Mike Franks?
The possibilities are endless.
Not for our dead Marine.
Grab your gear; we're going to Virginia Beach.
Got a new desk, McGee?
Not exactly, boss.
Sure looks new to me.
Let's go.
I was the first one in this morning, so the prank was pulled sometime last night, and you were at the office after I left.
I had dinner plans.
What time?
Uh, I don't recall.
I left at midnight, DiNozzo.
You were still at the office.
Area's on lockdown, sir.
Got a dead body in my jurisdiction, Petty Officer.
I'm following boss's orders, sir.
So if that's a problem, you can take it up with her.
What are you doing, boss?
You heard the man. We wait.
Wait?
Wait for what?
The person in charge, DiNozzo.
You're looking at her.
Agent Borin, I should've known.
Well, the coast guard presence was a pretty big clue.
What do you got, Borin?
One explosion on board an offshore oil platform plus the body of one dead Marine equals on big mess for NCIS and CGIS.
What caused the blowout?
No idea yet.
We can't get on board the platform to process the scene until the fires are contained and the platform's deemed structurally sound.
So all we've got is a body?
And the statements from the crew, all 59 of them.
So, might want to get started.
Yeah, go.
It's good to see the team hasn't changed too much, Gibbs.
I was sorry to hear about David.
I'm sure leaving couldn't have been an easy decision for her, and we've all been there.
You got a body for me, Borin?
Yeah.
The victim is Marv Hebner.
He was on the bridge at the time of the explosion.
Divers pulled his body from the water this morning.
His upper torso and face took the brunt of the damage.
Shrapnel damage is superficial. Wouldn't be the cause of death.
Won't know that until Ducky examines him. Trust me.
I've seen my share of blast-impact trauma up close.
But I'm sure Dr. Mallard will be able to confirm our suspicions.
You were in communication with Hebner during the drill?
Right up to the explosion.
And last he reported, all systems were normal.
You know, I've spent years working on oil rigs. I never seen anything like this happen before.
I mean, we have warning signs, alarms, fail-safes.
Well, if Hebner was the only one manning the controls, is it possible he overlooked one of the warning signs?
Human error?
Marv's the most experienced man on the rig.
This guy wasn't the type to make mistakes.
I'm Paige Hebner. I need to see...
I'm looking for...
No, there he is.
No, I got to see him. Jonah!
It's Marv's wife.
Jonah.
Hey, Paige.
It's not him, right?
It is.
I'm so sorry, Paige.
Mrs. Hebner, sorry for your loss.
I don't understand.
I just talked to Marv last night on the phone, and everything was fine.
What happened?
We're trying to figure that out.
Where is he?
Please?
Hey, come on. Come on.
No one on board recalls anything out of the ordinary before the explosion.
Systems checked out normally.
Average day.
Didn't end that way. Command Center got a call from the captain of a cargo freighter.
He recalled passing a motorboat with nonfunctioning running lights near the platform last night.
Think this could be some kind of terrorist attack?
Certainly wasn't a booze cruise.
Excuse me, Agent Borin?
Thanks.
Homeland Security's put all U.S. oil installations on heightened alert.
So this is either an isolated incident or...
It's the beginning of more to come.
Timmy, you fell prey to one of the oldest pranks in the book.
I guess that's why the classics never go out of style.
Lack of imagination and individuality?
Sounds like your M.O.
Don't be mad at me.
I didn't do anything.
You know what it is?
You make yourself too easy of a target, McBull's-eye.
You need to keep moving.
Now, me, I like a challenge.
Pulling one over on Gibbs, that would be a feat for the ages.
What do you have? A death wish?
I like to live dangerously.
Our dead Marine; let's go.
Marv Hebner, 45, major in the Selected Marine Corps Reserve with the combat engineer battalion.
Completed three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. His most recent deployment ended eight months ago, when he returned working for CityLine Oil.
It's a mid-level oil company with an impeccable safety record.
Until now, of course.
Updates from Homeland?
Well, they're keeping the threat level raised, but there's no chatter, and no terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the explosion.
The oil biz has Benham Parsa written all over it.
FBI?
They don't think there's a connection.
Intel shows that Parsa's still underground.
Navy and coast guard have air support out searching for the rogue boat reported by the cargo ship. Yeah, it's Gibbs.
What?
Where?
Agent Gibbs. Thank you for joining us in Director Vance's absence.
Let me introduce you to Perry Davidson, CEO of CityLine Oil, and their lead counsel, Brett Creevy.
We want you to know that CityLine is using all means at our disposal to get to the bottom of this mess.
If we can assist in any way, please let us know.
The last thing we want is another Gulf oil disaster on our hands.
The White House couldn't agree more.
It's why they've assigned me to oversee this investigation.
Marv Hebner was a member of the CityLine family.
It's a profound loss.
Mr. Creevy and I toured that platform earlier yesterday morning.
I never would've imagined this could happen.
And we've known our platforms might be a potential target for a terrorist attack.
We prepare for it, but it's still shocking.
I think it's a little premature to assume this is an act of terrorism, gentlemen.
I'm sure NCIS is keeping all investigative paths open.
Well, if it was an attack, it wasn't a very strategic one.
How do you mean that?
It's a matter of output and manpower.
That platform produces a fraction of the oil compared to our other rigs on the East Coast, and it's manned by a crew of 60.
The others have over 200.
Fallout from a larger platform would've been devastating.
Our priority is to address the cause of this incident and figure the best way to minimize the damage.
A man's dead. Hard to minimize that.
For centuries, All Hallows' Eve was a time of celebration and superstition.
It's thought to have originated with the Celtic festival of Samhain, where followers would light bonfires in an effort to ward off roaming ghosts and lurking evil spirits.
Ah!
Did you hear something?
Anyway, Halloween has since evolved into, of all things, a children's holiday.
Eager faces, some dressed in questionable déguisement going from door to door in search of trick or treat.
Which do you have for me, Dr. Mallard?
Agent Borin, I'd heard our paths were about to cross again.
Well, word travels fast.
Well, I can't imagine that I'm the only one who's glad to have you back in our little flock, albeit temporarily.
Uh, Dr. Mallard?
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
A faint beep.
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.
Where was I?
You tell me, Duck.
Ah, Jethro.
I was about to confirm what you two have already deduced.
Major Hebner's body did indeed receive a significant amount of trauma from the blast, but none of his internal organs, his vital ones, were affected.
What was the cause of death, then?
Well, this man drowned.
I suspect this contusion rendered him unconscious before he entered the water.
Hey, Borin.
Excuse me.
Borin.
You got anything else, Duck?
Well, I pulled a significant amount of material from the major's skin.
These gold fragments are the most curious.
I was about to send them up to Abby for analysis.
Oh, there it is again! Where is that confounded beep coming from?
Patrol found our rogue motorboat dead in the water five miles south of the platform.
Traced it back to a cruiser yacht who reported it scuttled in rough seas last week.
We got to board that platform.
Yeah, well, you're in luck-- the fires are out and we can process our crime scene.
You know, Major... I believe there is mischief afoot.
What do you think?
Abby?
Fire!
There's a fire!
McGee?
It's okay. Don't panic.
Do I look panicked?
Actually, no.
It's sage, McGee.
I'm purifying my sanctuary of the negative karma left by the Halloween prankster. Don't you think you're going a little overboard?
I mean, I don't like it when Tony touches my stuff, either, but I just use bleach.
Well, we're not certain that it's him, so we have to take all precautions.
Abby, you said you found something?
I did.
This is the operating mainframe on board the oil platform.
I reviewed all their system functions up to the explosion, and just like the crew said, everything was normal.
I found nothing.
I thought you said you found something.
Well, the nothing... is the something.
Abby, are you sure you didn't ingest any of that sage?
Maybe.
I found hidden malware installed on their server.
It's a rootkit, so it gave the hacker access to everything on board without being detected.
Which means someone could have manipulated the systems, remotely causing the blowout without triggering any alarms.
How was it downloaded onto the platform?
E-mail spam.
Who would open a file from "Enlarge and In Charge"?
We might have another way to trace our programmer.
Hackers tend to think of themselves as artists.
Some even find a way to sign their work.
It's usually embedded somewhere in their coding sequence.
Let's see if our Picasso left a mark that we can use to I.D. him.
Who's in charge now?
Which one's our techie?
Danielle Benton.
Advanced computer engineering degree from Carnegie Mellon.
There she is.
We live in a strange world, McGee.
I miss the days when computer nerds looked like you.
Danielle Benton.
NCIS. We need to speak with you.
The Navy.
Polluters of our oceans.
Killers of innocent marine life.
I didn't know they put that in the brochure.
Does this look familiar?
Looks like the computer program I designed for my thesis project.
Mmm. BS in terrorism?
Terrorism?
Yeah, your little number jumble was installed on board CityLine's oil platform before it exploded.
I don't know anything about that.
Then how did the program you designed end up in their system? I published it online three years ago.
It's a college paper.
Anyone could have duplicated it.
But that code couldn't have caused an explosion.
Why is that?
It's designed to be a tool for anti-corporate intelligence gathering, accessing records and internal communications data.
There's no input function capability.
It's looky... no touchy.
She's right.
Looky, no touchy.
Didn't they teach you that at M.I.T.?
Computer programming's changed a lot since Y2K.
Time for a refresher.
Sorry, McGeek, you've been dethroned.
All hail the queen.
I'm driving.
Uh, no, no, it's not through there.
Uh, the bridge is... further down under the helipad.
You've been on board here before?
Nah, I just know my way around a rig.
For my last tour in the Marines,
I was with a security detachment on the al-Kashir oil platform in Iraq.
All right, here we are.
Hebner was running a drill from this space.
Well, that explains how he got in the water.
Al-Kashir-- that was considered a hazardous duty assignment, right?
Yeah. We were a constant target.
Boat raids, suicide bombers-- threats came in all shapes and sizes.
Any close calls?
Yeah, once... on a routine patrol.
Got a distress signal from a local fisherman with his young son.
We spotted the vessel, pulled up alongside for inspection.
While we were still boarding, an IED went off.
Lost three men; a few more seconds, I would've been with them.
It was a long time ago, Gibbs. I'd rather focus on finding out what the hell caused this explosion.
I think we just have.
Yeah, well... that's the detonator.
Or what's left of it.
Well, there's goes the accident theory I was hoping for.
You know, of all the spaces to plant a bomb, why the bridge?
If you want to take down a tree, you do it at the base, not the branch.
Maybe it wasn't about the space.
The platform wasn't the target.
Marv Hebner was.
A detonator?
You're suggesting one of our men planted a bomb on the platform?
That's insane.
Every CityLine employee is properly vetted and goes through an extensive background investigation-- before they're hired.
- No one had any red flags.
- Someone does now.
Was Marv Hebner having any problems with a particular crew member?
I wouldn't say a problem.
I was aware of a falling-out he had with Jonah McGuire, his operations officer. About what?
McGuire was cited for a safety violation during a recent OSHA inspection.
The company decided to let McGuire go.
It was a decision that Hebner signed off on.
Did McGuire know he was being let go?
Paperwork was still being finalized, but he saw the writing on the wall.
Why would someone want to kill Marv?
We were hoping you could tell us.
I have no idea.
That's not what we heard.
Sounded like you had a pretty big ax to grind.
Then you're misinformed.
Marv was my closest friend.
Signing your termination papers wasn't too friendly.
Friends are supposed to have your back, not stab you in it.
That's not what it seems. I wasn't angry over him for getting fired.
It was my idea.
That makes no sense.
There's a lot of that going on today.
Marv was the one at fault for that safety hit, not me.
I took the fall because I knew what the consequences would be.
So you lied in order to get fired-- still not making sense.
You don't understand what the job meant to Marv.
And an OSHA infraction would have ruined his career. I-I...
I couldn't let that happen after all the things he'd done for me.
I didn't kill him.
I was... was trying to protect him.
Perfect timing, as always. You're expecting me?
Agent Abby!
I mean, I'm not glad about the "dead body" situation and all, but I'm just, I'm really happy that you're here.
And how about... now?
Oh. That is a lot of affection for some caffeine.
I should come around more often.
Yes. I agree with that 110%.
Although that's not numerically possible, for emphasis, it totally works.
Happy I can help.
Well, now it's my turn to help you.
What do you got, Abbs?
I'm still processing the debris from the platform-- it's gonna take some time-- but I can give you some information about the bomb itself.
That's good.
No. Not really.
The cell phone detonator is a disposable, so there's no trail.
And the explosive device, the main ingredient was pure black powder.
Which isn't regulated, making it nearly impossible to trace.
We do know that the bomb had minimal damage payload, so we're not dealing with some professional big-time terrorist.
But it didn't need to be. With all flammable gasses and materials on board that platform, all they needed was the right ignition point to set off a chain reaction.
Which brings me to my next interesting fact.
Based on the device's blast radius, it was placed in the one spot on the bridge where a chain reaction wouldn't take out the entire rig.
Either they got really lucky... or our bomber had intimate knowledge of the platform's structural layout.
I don't believe in luck.
That's good work, Abbs.
I got an uneasy feeling, McGee.
Well, I told you not to order Chinese from a Mexican restaurant.
I'm talking about SECNAV.
She's been hanging around here a lot lately.
Don't speak ill of José the Mandarin.
His egg rolls are muy bueno.
Look, this is NCIS, Porter's the SECNAV-- she's just doing her job.
I had this same bad feeling back when I was at Ohio State my sophomore year.
They brought in a new head coach.
New coach means new lineup.
You think SECNAV's looking to switch things up around here?
Don't worry, I got your back.
Every team needs a water boy.
Where are we?
Hey, boss.
Uh, verified the background checks on the CityLine employees-- nothing noteworthy.
Fines for public intoxication, delinquent car payments and some serious 1-900 charges to a guy who's clearly never heard of the Internet.
I've got something.
The entire food service team on board the platform was hired through a third-party vendor.
Which means they didn't have to go through CityLine's background check.
They still wouldn't have proper clearance to access the bridge.
Anyone with a criminal record?
Um Lenny Pachaca, a line cook.
Working under the alias "Lenny Machaca." Hmm.
Didn't really think outside of the box on that one, did he?
He did time for possession and transportation of explosives.
DiNozzo, get Borin, bring him in.
Will do.
I love that smell.
Rotting fish carcass and diesel fuel?
Yeah, breathe it in.
You're a special lady, Borin.
I can't wait to meet the peg-legged gentleman who woos you.
Yo-ho-ho, DiNozzo.
Lenny Machaca?
Oh, come on...
I'll cut him off.
College softball.
Southpaw?
I swung both ways.
I think this crazy bitch broke my ribs.
Trust me, Len... you want to quit while you're ahead.
And you're still breathing.
I already told you... you've got the wrong guy.
It's been my experience only people with something to hide run from the cops.
And use aliases.
I see what you're trying to do, but you're not pinning this to me.
I didn't do it.
Well, you also claimed that you didn't have any issues with Marv Hebner, yet your supervisor says he made complaints about you.
Said you were a loose cannon.
You unpredictable, Len?
Bet you didn't like him keeping you in line.
He was a tightly-wound hard-ass.
Rode everyone like a damn drill sergeant.
This wasn't the Marines.
Guess he finally pushed the wrong guy too far.
The wrong guy with a criminal background in explosives?
Because there's only one guy on board that meets that criteria, and that's... that's you. Arrested for possession of C-4, chargers, blasting caps, and gunpowder.
Oh, Lenny... old habits die hard.
That was a long time ago, all right?
My friend and I got a kick out of blowing stuff up. No one got hurt.
We were just having fun.
It was fun? Yeah.
Just a way to goof off.
Never saw what the big deal was, so...
Have... have you ever seen what that kind of fun does to the human body at close range, Lenny? No?
Let me enlighten you.
You're temporarily blinded, but trust me, that's a blessing, because the last thing you want to see is what's about to happen to you.
And then there's the sound. It's the loudest sound you have ever heard in your entire life.
It's also the last sound you're ever gonna hear.
And then there's the silence.
And you can't even hear yourself scream as the heat from the blow-back melts your skin and the shrapnel tears through your body!
So why don't you tell me, Lenny... are we having fun yet?
Huh? This fun for you?
I'm done listening to this. Oh, my God, you're so not.
Hey, we've just started.
So why don't you stay where you are? Agent Borin.
Take a break.
Look, I only used an alias because I couldn't get a job with my record. All right?
I have a family to provide for.
That's all I've done, I swear.
I'll take a polygraph or whatever, just... keep her away from me.
Well, I was always partial to the Green Dragon Tavern.
Tuesdays they would host...
American history triviology.
I know, I went every week.
Okay, what about outside Cambridge?
Tough choice, but I'm gonna have to go with... Boss.
Didn't see you come in.
You're probably wondering what I'm doing.
We were just discussing our academic history in Boston.
M.I.T., Harvard. Excuse me.
Thanks for the trip down memory lane, Tim.
Yes, ma'am.
Porter.
What did you find out?
Quite a bit, actually.
She wrote for the Crimson, she was a member of the debate club, graduated magna cum laude.
About the case, McGee. Oh.
Right.
Well, since his, uh, release from prison, Lenny has kept his record clean.
I confirmed his alibi with two of the other onboard cooks.
They say he was working all day on the mess decks up until the drill.
That's not much of a lead. This is.
Check it out.
Schematics of CityLine's oil platform.
The firm who designed the plans had a minor security breach two weeks ago.
This was the only file that was compromised. What kind of breach?
It was the same type of malware we found on CityLine's mainframe.
One person they have in common.
Danielle Benton.
Find her, McGee. Bye-bye.
I thought that move was pure urban legend.
Something you care to share,
Madam Secretary?
Pardon me?
Is there another reason for your presence here, besides this investigation?
Matters of my agenda are above your pay grade, Agent Gibbs.
If it involves me or my team, I respectfully disagree.
Rest assured, my presence at NCIS is purely case-specific.
You have your orders. So do I.
However, as a person with a background in business, I would be remiss if I didn't notice certain gaps in this office when it comes to manpower.
Staffing issues are below your pay grade.
Not if it's affecting the efficiency of this agency.
It isn't.
I agree.
I'm not here to mark my territory, Agent Gibbs.
It's your team.
You run it as you see fit.
As long as I keep seeing results, we won't have an issue.
If it ain't broke...
Here you go.
Yeah, sure, I can use another round.
Well... say something, Gibbs.
Kind of waiting on you, Borin.
I'm the one who's in the dark.
Look, I-I shouldn't have taken this case.
I knew it would just... dredge up too many things I didn't want to revisit.
Well, maybe if you knew that, it's why you took the case.
I still remember every detail of that day in Iraq.
I'd play it over and over and over in my head, just, you know, thinking... of all the stuff I could've done differently.
Signs I missed.
Losing a man in combat, it stays with you.
I didn't just lose three fellow Marines in that blast.
Gibbs, I lost my Marine.
Liam...
He always had to be the one leading the charge, you know?
That was his style.
He was, uh... strong. Stubborn, God...
Cocky as all hell.
A Marine's Marine.
I saw him board the vessel...
I saw the blast take him... and I saw what was left when I pulled him from the water.
That was just something I couldn't come back from.
Yeah, DiNozzo?
Boss, we've tracked Danielle Benton's cell to a marina outside Hampton Roads.
McGee's sending you the address.
Okay, we'll meet you there.
About ready to go? I'm driving.
No, after everything that's happened,
I think it's best for everyone if I just pull out of the case.
It's fine, look, I'm gonna call headquarters, they can assign you another agent...
No, Borin, not happening.
My case, my call.
You pulling rank on me, gunny?
A Marine leaves no man behind.
Make sure we're fueled and ready.
I want to be out of here before the tide shifts.
Don't leave yet.
Who the hell are you?
I already answered NCIS's questions.
If you want more I.T. support, try the Genius Bar.
You taking a trip? Work.
Surveying the ecological impact of coastal shipping routes on local whale migration.
And yes, we have a permit.
Boss... Watch 'em.
What do you got?
Crabs.
We have a problem.
Worse than DiNozzo's crabs?
It's black powder.
And there are more than 50 buckets like it down there.
That's enough to level this entire marina.
Don't worry, you'll get used to loud noises in prison.
And with what we found on board, you're in for an extended stay.
Containers of gasoline, black powder, and soap.
Also known as "vegan napal"" in environmental extremist circles.
I've never seen those containers before in my life.
Must be the captain's.
I'm innocent.
Told you she'd say that.
He did;
he said you'd say that. He also said you'd lean back and cross your arms.
He did the whole thing, it was very good.
He also said that you would be a little surprised when you found out that we discovered your... hiding spot underneath the wheel-house floorboard.
Building plans, surveillance photos, and security access codes belonging to ten biotech labs across the East Coast... each hit by the same arsonist.
Too bad you didn't think to wipe your prints off all these.
Christmas came early this year for the FBI. Boo-ya.
"Boo-ya"?
What is that?
Those labs were conducting invasive and unethical tests on innocent animals.
What they do isn't research; it's torture.
I did what was necessary to save lives.
Well, you didn't seem to mind taking Marv Hebner's life for your cause.
Oh, yeah, we found a copy of the CityLine blueprint on board.
Boo-ya!
Is that right?
Yeah. I didn't steal the designs to bomb the platform.
I was going to board it.
Next month.
An onboard protest against offshore drilling, where CityLine wouldn't be able to ignore us.
I'd say you got their attention.
That explosion caused irreparable damage to the ocean's ecosystems.
I have no problem going to prison for what I believe in, but that is against everything I stand for.
Gabs! Gabs! Gabs!
Gabs. It just... saves time. You know, just...
just go with it.
Um, I found something fishy on our evidence. Like, really fishy.
Acipenser oxyrinchus.
Otherwise known as... the North Atlantic sturgeon. Found where?
Melted on the detonator and other debris from the bridge.
This fish sample was altered with acrylic resin, potassium chromium sulfate, formaldehyde...
Abbs...
English.
Fish leather.
Like from a work boot? No.
Uh, sturgeon leather is very rare and extremely expensive. So it would be a more high-quality good.
Can you narrow it down for us?
I can, thanks to a metal shard that Ducky pulled from Hebner's body.
This wasn't just shrapnel. It's a piece of an alloy tumbler locking mechanism.
Separately, the lock and the leather didn't make any sense, but when you put them together, you get this.
The Merion Attaché.
That is where the bomb was stored.
A briefcase-- innocuous enough to hide in plain sight.
That's good work, Abbs.
She's not done yet.
He knows me so well.
I cross-referenced the purchase logs for the Merion Attaché with all of the employees from CityLine, and I got a match.
Brett Creevy, legal department.
Is he checking his e-mail?
Oh, he's a smug son of a bitch, isn't he?
Lawyer. Boss.
Planting a bomb was just one of Creevy's many bad decisions.
He lost his life savings in the Broad Street development Ponzi scheme last year.
Didn't have much to his name until the explosion.
Turns out Creevy short-sold shares of CityLine's stock last week.
Once news of the explosion broke, their stocks took a nosedive.
Just like BP's did after their incident in the Gulf.
Wall Street.
"Greed is good."
The Gekko.
Love that movie.
Creevy made a boatload of cash, boss.
Define "boatload."
Tens of millions.
I tracked his funds to an offshore account, where I found a charge for a chartered flight to the Maldives, departing tonight.
All yours, Borin.
With pleasure.
Good luck.
You sure that's a good idea, boss?
'Cause last time, she went a little Dirty Harry in there.
But... of course, Agent Borin is a professional, and I trust her completely.
I have been sitting here for almost an hour, Agent Borin.
You have CityLine's full cooperation, but I have a schedule to keep to.
I understand.
I'm sure you're anxious to get home, pack for your trip. Trip?
What are you talking about?
You bought a one-way ticket to the Maldives. You know, that's a really nice choice.
It's got gorgeous white-sand beaches, palm trees and no extradition.
And I know one piece of luggage you won't be taking with you.
You know what's interesting about this? I've got witnesses who recall you on board the platform the morning of the explosion carrying that briefcase.
But no one seems to remember you leaving with it.
Not even Perry Davidson, who spent the entire day with you.
Hmm. Maybe now is the time to mention that I have a team of agents searching your house as we speak.
Oh, yeah.
They found the bomb-making materials in your garage. Mmm.
So... if a first-class ticket to death row doesn't appeal to you, Mr. Creevy, I suggest you start talking.
It's not how I planned it.
I didn't know Hebner was going to be on the bridge during the drill.
I just wanted the money. No one was supposed to get hurt.
I... I swear.
So, that's it?
He cracked already?
Full confession, ten minutes.
Don't get excited. My record's five.
Dr. Mallard, what do you have there?
This, my dear, is the infernal contraption that's been driving me mad these last two days.
The ThinkGeek Annoy-a-tron? Yeah.
Annoying is an understatement.
I've heard of these things.
They send out high-frequency sounds intermittently.
Yeah, making it impossible to find.
The intention, I suspect.
I finally found it tucked into my desk lamp.
Remember, Anthony, revenge is all the more sweet.
What...?
Why does everyone assume it's me?
Because nothing's happened to you.
And because you're you.
Borin... come on. You know I'm innocent. Back me up here.
I see.
Well, I've been framed, and I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
Wait and see.
You're already at the bottom, DiNozzo.
Your secret's safe with me.
Weighed-down gear pack?
It's the oldest Marine prank there is.
No idea what you're talking about.
Right.
Hey. I want to ask you something.
When you left the Corps, was CGIS the change you were looking for?
Not exactly.
At least not at first.
More like running away than a fresh start.
But eventually, it became more.
And the work started to mean something.
Started to feel...
A sense of purpose again?
You're good.
Tell me how the story ends, I'll be really impressed.
Well, that kind of depends on you, Borin. How's that?
You ever think about making another change?
It's a tempting thought.
But I'd be lying if I said I hadn't considered it.
But I don't think I'm finished with CGIS just yet. Yeah, it's still a good fit.
Besides, I got a whole lot of lessons to teach Omagi before I let him take over.
Can't argue with that.
Borin.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Well, it's about that time.
Thank you for the drink.
Say I wanted to make a change in the near future.
I'm not going anywhere.
Semper fi, Gibbs.
Semper paratus...
Borin.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Hurry!
Do you not understand?
Krypton's core is collapsing.
We may only have a matter of weeks.
I warned you.
Harvesting the core was suicide.
It has accelerated... - ...the process of implosion.
- Our energy reserves were exhausted.
What would you have us do, El?
Look to the stars, like our ancestors did.
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outposts.
Are you seriously suggesting that we evacuate the entire planet?
No. Everybody here is already dead.
Give me control of the Codex.
I will ensure the survival of our race.
There is still hope.
I have held that hope in my hands.
This council has been disbanded.
On whose authority?
Mine.
The rest of you will be tried and punished accordingly.
- What are you doing, Zod?
- What I should have done years ago.
These lawmakers with their endless debates have led Krypton to ruin.
And if your forces prevail... - ...you'll be the leader of nothing. - Then join me.
Help me save our race.
We'll start anew.
We'll sever the degenerative bloodlines that led us to this state.
And who will decide which bloodlines survive, Zod?
You?
Don't do this, El.
The last thing I want is for us to be enemies.
You have abandoned the principles that bound us together.
You've taken up the sword against your own people.
I will honor the man you once were, Zod not this monster you've become.
Take him away.
Sir? Is everything all right?
Out of the way.
I said--
Get me Lara.
Jor. Behind you.
Lara, you have to ready the launch.
I'll be with you as soon as I can.
H'Raka!
- Can you see the Codex?
- It's just beneath the central hub.
But I'm compelled to warn you.
Breaching the genesis chamber is a Class-B crime--
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.
The world is about to come to an end.
Jor-El, by the authority of General Zod surrender the Codex.
Easy, H'Raka.
Did you find a world?
- Orbiting a main sequence yellow star just as you said it would.
A young star.
His cells will drink its radiation.
It's a seemingly intelligent population.
He'll be an outcast.
A freak.
They'll kill him. How?
He'll be a god to them.
What if the ship doesn't make it?
He'll die out there alone.
I can't do it.
I thought I could, but...
- Lara.
- ...now that he's here...
Krypton is doomed.
It's his only chance now.
It's our people's only hope.
What is it, Kelex?
Five attack ships converging from the east.
Citadel's defenses are being scanned and evaluated.
I'll upload the Codex.
No, wait.
Lara.
Just let me look at him.
We'll never get to see him walk.
Never hear him say our names.
But out there amongst the stars he will live.
Goodbye, my son.
Our hopes and dreams travel with you.
Concentrate fire on the main doors.
Lady Lara. - The phantom drives are coming online.
- Proceed to ignition.
General.
We have identified an engine ignition within the citadel.
A launch.
Hold this platform, commander.
I know you stole the Codex, Jor-El.
Surrender it and I'll let you live.
This is a second chance for all of Krypton not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.
What have you done?
We've had a child, Zod.
A boy child.
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.
And he will be free.
Free to forge his own destiny.
Heresy.
Destroy it.
Lara listen to me.
The Codex is Krypton's future.
Abort the launch.
Your son, Lara where have you sent him?
His name is Kal son of El.
And he's beyond your reach.
Bring that ship down.
Target locked.
Lay down your weapons.
Your forces are surrounded.
General Zod for the crimes of murder and high treason the Council has sentenced you and your fellow insurgents to three hundred cycles of somatic reconditioning.
Do you have any last words?
You won't kill us yourself!
You wouldn't sully your hands!
But you'll damn us to a black hole for eternity!
Jor-El was right.
You're a pack of fools, every last one of you.
And you. You believe your son is safe?
I will find him.
I will reclaim what you have taken from us.
I will find him.
I will find him, Lara.
I will find him!
Lady Lara, shouldn't you find refuge?
There is no refuge, Kelor.
Jor-El was right.
This is the end.
Make a better world than ours, Kal.
Watch it, dumb-ass!
Keep your eyes open or you're gonna get squashed.
Where the hell did they find you, greenhorn?
Let's get this trap in the air.
Gentlemen, secure the deck.
We just got a distress call from a rig due west of us.
Secure the deck.
All civilian boats, stand clear.
The sub-sea valves failed and the rig is about to explode.
Roger, Coast Guard.
What about the men left inside?
- Forget them. They're dead.
- Greenhorn fetch me my binoculars.
Greenhorn.
This is the last of the oxygen. I don't know how much longer we can hold out.
This is Coast Guard 6510.
We'll make one more pass, then get out.
Wait, wait.
I got some guys on the helipad.
Get that last guy loaded.
We have got to go.
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?
--when Kansas became a territory?
Clark.
Are you listening, Clark?
I asked if you could tell me who first settled Kansas.
Are you all right, Clark?
Clark.
Clark, come out of there.
Leave me alone.
Clark, I have called your mother.
I'm here.
Clark, honey, it's Mom.
Will you open the door?
- What's wrong with him? - He's such a freak.
Crybaby.
His parents won't even let him play with other kids.
Sweetie. How can I help you if you won't let me in?
The world's too big, Mom.
Then make it small.
Just, um focus on my voice.
Pretend it's an island out in the ocean.
Can you see it?
I see it.
Then swim towards it, honey.
What's wrong with me, Mom?
- Did you get everything I need?
- Yep.
Hold it, hold it.
Hey, ass-wipe.
What do you think?
You see the game?
- Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?
I wanna hear what he has to say.
Come on dick-splash.
My son was there.
He was in the bus.
- He saw what Clark did.
- I know he did.
- I'm sure what he thought he saw was--
- Was an act of God, Jonathan.
This was providence.
I think you're blowing it out of proportion.
No, I'm not.
Lana saw it too.
And the Fordham boy.
This isn't the first time Clark's done something like this.
I just wanted to help.
I know you did, but we talked about this.
Right?
Right? We talked about this.
You have...
Clark, you have to keep this side of yourself a secret.
What was I supposed to do?
Just let them die?
Maybe.
There's more at stake here than just our lives, Clark, or the lives of those around us.
When the world...
When the world finds out what you can do it's gonna change everything. Our...
Our beliefs, our notions of what it means to be human.
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?
She was scared, Clark.
Why?
People are afraid of what they don't understand.
Is she right?
Did God do this to me?
Tell me.
We found you in this.
We were sure the government was gonna show up on our doorstep but no one ever came.
This was in that chamber with you.
I took it to a metallurgist at Kansas State.
He said whatever it was made from didn't even... Didn't even exist on the periodic table.
That's another way of saying that it's not from this world, Clark.
And neither are you.
You're the answer, son.
You're the answer to "Are we alone in the universe?"
I don't wanna be.
And I don't blame you, son.
It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bear.
But you're not just anyone, Clark, and I have to believe that you were...
That you were sent here for a reason.
All these changes that you're going through, one day... One day you're gonna think of them as a blessing.
When that day comes you have to make a choice.
A choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not.
Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son?
You are my son.
But somewhere out there you've... You have another father too, who gave you another name.
And he sent you here for a reason, Clark.
And even if it takes you the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is.
Wait a second. Aren't you here for the exercise?
No, there was a change in the plans.
Somebody found something strange on Ellesmere.
- Aircom's making runs out there all week.
- That rat hole?
- You gotta be kidding me. - I know.
It's crazy. The Americans are there too, lots of them.
- Anything else? - They're calling it an anomalous object.
- Whatever that means.
- Back off, Ludlow.
I'm serious.
- Oh, come on, Chrissy.
- Knock it off.
- Sit down.
- Let me go.
Hey. Leave her alone, man.
Or what, tough guy?
Or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I think I'll probably just leave when I'm good and ready.
Oh, there he is.
It's not worth it, sweetie.
Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip.
Strike.
Thanks.
Miss Lane. How you doing?
- Good.
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.
How far to the station?
- Camp's just over the rise.
I'll walk you over.
- Great.
Joe can take your bags.
Joe.
Help her out.
Careful with those. They're heavy.
I gotta confess, Miss Lane I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet.
But those pieces you wrote when you were embedded with the 1st Division were...
Well, they were pretty impressive.
Well, what can I say? I get writer's block if I'm not wearing a flak jacket.
Miss Lane.
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom.
Dr. Emil Hamilton from DARPA.
- You're early. - Hi.
We were expecting you tomorrow.
Which is why I showed up today.
Look, let's get one thing straight, guys, okay?
The only reason I'm here is because we're on Canadian soil and the appellate court overruled your injunction to keep me away.
So if we're done measuring dicks can you have your people show me what you found?
NASA's EOS satellites pinged the anomaly first.
The ice shelf plays hell on the echo soundings. - But there's something there.
- A submarine, maybe? Soviet-era?
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.
Considerably larger than anything we know they built back then.
But here's the spooky part.
The ice surrounding the object it's nearly twenty thousand years old.
Miss Lane?
Try not to wander.
Temperatures drop to minus 40 at night around here.
Wouldn't find your body till after spring.
And there you go.
What if I need to tinkle?
There's a bucket in the corner.
Where the hell are you going?
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
It's all right.
You're hemorrhaging internally and if I don't cauterize this bleed...
How can--?
I can do things that other people can't.
Now hold my hand.
This is gonna hurt.
What Colonel Hardy and his team surmised was a Soviet-era submarine was actually something much more exotic.
An isotope analysis of the surrounding ice bores suggests that an object had been trapped in the glacier for over 18,000 years.
As for my rescuer?
He disappeared during the object's departure.
A background check revealed that his work history and identity had been falsified.
The questions raised by my rescuer's existence are frightening to contemplate but I also know what I saw.
"And I have arrived at the inescapable conclusion that the object and its occupant did not originate on Earth."
I can't print this, Lois.
You might have hallucinated half of it.
What about the contractors who corroborated... - ...my story?
- The Pentagon is denying that there was a ship.
Of course they are.
They're supposed to. It's the Pentagon.
Perry, it's me we're talking about.
- I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.
- Then act like it.
- Print it or I walk.
- You can't.
You're under contract.
I'm not running a story about aliens walking among us.
Never gonna happen.
That's a Scotch, straight-up, for the lady.
I'm sending you the article.
My editor won't print it, but if it leaked online...
Got it.
But didn't you once describe my site as a creeping cancer of falsehoods?
I stand by my words, Woodburn, but I want this story...
- ...out there.
- Why?
Because I want my mystery man to know I know the truth.
Recursive diagnostics complete.
Guiding presence authenticated.
All systems operational.
To see you standing there having grown into an adult...
If only Lara could have witnessed this.
Who are you?
I am your father, Kal.
Or at least a shadow of him.
His consciousness.
My name was Jor-El.
And Kal?
That's my name.
Kal-El.
It is.
I have so many questions.
Where do I come from?
Why did you send me here?
You came from Krypton.
A world with a much harsher environment than Earth's.
Long ago in an era of expansion our race spread out through the stars seeking new worlds to settle upon.
This scout ship was one of thousands launched into the void.
We built outposts on other planets using great machines to reshape environments to our needs.
For 100,000 years, our civilization flourished accomplishing wonders.
What happened?
Artificial population control was established.
The outposts on space exploration were abandoned.
We exhausted our natural resources.
As a result, our planet's core became unstable.
Eventually, our military leader General Zod, attempted a coup.
But by then it was too late.
Your mother and I foresaw the coming calamity and we took certain steps to ensure your survival.
This is a genesis chamber.
All Kryptonians were conceived in chambers such as this.
Every child was designed to fulfill a pre-determined role in our society as a worker a warrior, a leader and so on.
Your mother and I believed Krypton lost something precious.
The element of choice, of chance.
What if a child dreamed of becoming something other than what society had intended for him or her?
What if a child aspired to something greater?
You were the embodiment of that belief, Kal.
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.
That's why we risked so much to save you.
Why didn't you come with me?
We couldn't, Kal.
No matter how much we wanted to.
No matter how much we loved you.
Your mother, Lara, and I were a product of the failures of our world as much as Zod was tied to its fate.
- So I'm alone.
- No.
You're as much a child of Earth now as you are of Krypton.
You can embody the best of both worlds.
A dream your mother and I dedicated our lives to preserve.
The people of Earth are different from us, it's true.
But, ultimately, I believe that's a good thing.
They won't necessarily make the same mistakes we did.
Not if you guide them, Kal.
Not if you give them hope.
That's what this symbol means.
The symbol of the house of El means hope.
Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief in the potential of every person to be a force for good.
That's what you can bring them.
Why am I so different from them?
Earth's sun is younger and brighter than Krypton's was.
Your cells have drunk in its radiation strengthening your muscles, your skin, your senses.
Earth's gravity is weaker, yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.
You've grown stronger here than I ever could have imagined.
The only way to know how strong is to keep testing your limits.
You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards.
They'll race behind you.
They will stumble.
They will fall.
But in time they will join you in the sun, Kal.
In time you will help them accomplish wonders.
How do you find someone who has spent a lifetime covering his tracks?
You start with the urban legends...
- ...that have sprung up in his wake.
- That's Joe. The friends of a friend... - ...who have seen him.
For some he was a guardian angel.
For others, a cipher a ghost who never quite fit in.
As you work your way back in time, the stories form a pattern.
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
Do you know him?
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.
If you go down the road...
Pete Ross?
I'd like to talk to you about an accident when you were younger.
A school bus that went into the river.
Dusty. Shh-shh-shh.
Mrs. Kent?
I'm Lois Lane. I'm from the Daily Planet.
Quiet.
I'm from the Daily Planet and I'd like to talk to you about your son.
I figured if I turned over enough stones you'd eventually find me.
Where are you from?
What are you doing here?
Let me tell your story.
What if I don't want my story told?
It's going to come out eventually.
Somebody's going to get a photograph or figure out where you live.
- Then I'll disappear again.
- The only way you could disappear is to stop helping people altogether, and I sense that's not an option for you.
My father believed that if the world found out who I really was they'd reject me out of fear.
I'm tired of safe.
I just wanna do something useful with my life.
So farming, feeding people. That's not useful?
I didn't say that.
Our family's been farming for five generations.
Your family, not mine.
I don't even know why I'm listening to you. You're not my dad. You're just some guy who found me in a field.
Clark.
It's all right, Martha.
He's right. Clark has a point.
We're not your parents.
But we've been doing the best we can.
And we've been making this up as we go along, so maybe... Maybe our best isn't good enough anymore.
Look, Dad--
Hold on.
Go for the overpass.
Go for the overpass!
Take cover!
Take cover!
- Over there. Just follow them.
She's stuck.
Hank's still in the car.
Hank's in the car.
- I'll get him, I'll get him.
- No, no.
Get your mom to the overpass.
Hank! Hank!
Come!
- Jonathan!
- Mom, it's okay.
- Jonathan!
- Mom, stay here.
Dad!
I let my father die because I trusted him.
Because he was convinced that I had to wait.
That the world was not ready.
What do you think?
You better watch out, Lois.
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.
He knows you're Woodburn's anonymous source and cannot wait to rip you a new one.
Oh, look at her.
I told you not to run with this, and what do you do?
You let Woodburn just shotgun it all over the Internet.
Now the publishers want me to sue you.
Well, if it makes a difference, I'm dropping it.
Whoa, just like that?
Yep.
What happened to your leads?
They didn't pan out.
The story is smoke.
Or it didn't get the traction you hoped?
Two weeks leave no pay, that's your penance.
You try something like this again... - ...you're done here.
- Fine.
Let's make it three weeks since you're so willing to agree.
- Perry.
- No, no. Don't. Don't.
I believe you saw something, Lois.
But not for a moment do I believe that your leads just went cold.
So whatever your reasons are for dropping it I think you're doing the right thing.
Why?
Can you imagine how people on this planet would react if they knew there was someone like this out there?
Go get him.
Well, look at you.
A reporter came by here.
She's a friend.
Don't worry.
Mom.
What?
- I found them.
- Who?
My parents.
My people.
I know where I come from now.
That's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you, Clark.
- What?
- It's nothing.
When you were a baby I used to lay by your crib at night listening to you breathe.
It was hard for you.
You struggled.
And I worried all the time.
You worried the truth would come out.
The truth about you is beautiful.
We saw that the moment we laid eyes on you.
We knew that one day, the whole world would see that.
I'm just...
I'm worried they'll take you away from me.
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.
I promise.
General Swanwick, sir.
What am I looking at, doc?
Comet?
Asteroid?
Comets don't make course corrections, general.
Wanted you to see this before some amateur with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.
The ship appears to have inserted itself into a lunar synchronous orbit though I have no idea why.
Have you tried... communicating with it?
Well, they haven't responded as of yet.
I'm just speculating, but I think whoever's at the helm of that thing is looking to make a dramatic entrance.
Anybody know where we keep the toner?
- What's going on?
- It's all over the news.
You gotta see this.
Coming.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
It's coming in on the RSS feeds.
It's on my phone too.
My name is General Zod.
I come from a world far from yours.
I have journeyed across an ocean of stars to reach you.
For some time, your world has sheltered one of my citizens.
I request that you return this individual to my custody.
For reasons unknown, he has chosen to keep his existence a secret from you.
He will have made efforts to blend in.
He will look like you.
But he is not one of you.
To those of you who may know of his current location the fate of your planet rests in your hands.
To Kal-El, I say this:
Surrender within 24 hours or watch this world suffer the consequences.
We hardly know anything about him, isn't that right?
If he truly means us no harm he'll turn himself in and face the consequences.
And if he won't do that then maybe we should.
The Daily Planet's Lois Lane knows who this guy is.
She's the one we should be questioning.
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.
For once I agree with Woodburn.
Have you seen him?
- Do you know where he is?
- No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say.
The entire world is being threatened here.
This is not time for you to fall back on journalistic integrity.
This is serious, Lois.
The FBI is here.
They're throwing around words like "treason."
I gotta go.
FBI.
Hands up.
Drop the bag. Now.
Regarding the visitors themselves we know very little.
According to government officials the visitors do not represent a threat despite the ominous tone of their message.
Then of course there's the question on everyone's mind:
"Who is this Kal-El person?
Does he actually exist?
How could he have remained hidden from us for so long?"
Come on, Kent.
Come on. Fight back.
Get up, Kent.
So is that it?
Is that all you've got?
Come on, Kent.
Come on!
Did they hurt you?
You know they can't.
That's not what I meant.
I meant, are you all right?
I wanted to hit that kid. I wanted to hit him bad.
I know you did.
I mean part of me even wanted you to, but then what?
Make you feel any better?
You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark.
Because whoever that man is, good character or bad, he's...
He's gonna change the world.
What's on your mind?
I don't know where to start.
Wherever you want.
That ship that appeared last night.
I'm the one they're looking for.
Do you know why they want you?
No.
But this General Zod even if I surrender, there's no guarantee he'll keep his word, but if there's a chance I can save Earth by turning myself in shouldn't I take it?
What does your gut tell you?
Zod can't be trusted.
The problem is I'm not sure the people of Earth can be either.
Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith first.
The trust part comes later.
All right. You've got our attention.
What is it you want?
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.
What makes you think she's here?
Don't play games with me, general.
I'll surrender, but only if you guarantee Lois's freedom.
Why are you surrendering to Zod?
I'm surrendering to mankind.
There's a difference.
You let them handcuff you?
Wouldn't be much of a surrender if I resisted.
And if it makes them feel more secure then all the better for it.
What's the S stand for?
It's not an S.
On my world it means hope.
Well, here, it's an S.
How about Super--
Sir?
- Hi, my name is Dr. E--
- Emil Hamilton.
I know, I can see your ID tag in your breast pocket.
Along with a half-eaten roll of Lifesavers.
I can also see the soldiers in the next room preparing that tranquilizing agent of yours.
You won't need it.
Sir, you can't expect us to not take precautions.
You could be carrying some kind of alien pathogen.
Been here for 33 years, doctor.
- Haven't infected anyone yet. - That you know of.
We have legitimate security concerns.
You revealed your identity to Miss Lane over there.
Why won't you do the same with us?
Let's put our cards on the table here, general.
You're scared because you can't control me.
You don't, and you never will.
But that doesn't mean I'm your enemy.
Then who is?
Zod?
That's what I'm worried about.
Be that as it may I've been given orders to hand you over to him.
Do what you have to do, general.
Thank you.
For what?
For believing in me.
Didn't make much difference in the end.
It did to me.
They're coming.
You should leave now.
Go, Lois.
Kal-El.
I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul.
On behalf of General Zod, I extend you his greetings.
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am. General Zod would like this woman to accompany me.
You asked for the alien.
You didn't say anything about one of our own.
Shall I tell the general you're unwilling to comply?
I don't care what you tell him.
It's all right.
I'll go.
The atmospheric composition on our ship is not compatible with humans.
You need to wear a breather beyond this point.
Kal-El.
You have no idea how long we've been searching for you.
I take it you're Zod?
General Zod.
- Our commander.
- It's all right, Faora.
We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.
He's a stranger to our ways.
This should be cause for celebration, not conflict.
- Not conflict.
I feel strange.
Weak.
What's happening to him?
He's rejecting our ship's atmospherics.
You've spent a lifetime adapting to Earth's ecology but never adapted to ours.
Help him.
I can't. Whatever's happening...
- ...has to run its course. - Clark.
Help him.
Hello, Kal.
Or do you prefer Clark?
That's the name they gave you. Isn't it?
I was Krypton's military leader your father our foremost scientist.
The only thing we agreed on was that Krypton was dying.
In return for my efforts to protect our civilization and save our planet I and my fellow officers were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.
And then the destruction of our world freed us.
We were adrift, destined to float amongst the ruins of our planet until we starved.
How did you find your way to Earth?
We managed to retrofit the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.
Your father made a similar modification to the craft that brought you here.
And so the instrument of our damnation became our salvation.
We sought out the old colonial outposts looking for signs of life.
But all we found was death.
Cut off from Krypton, these outposts withered and died long ago.
We salvaged what we could armor, weapons even a world engine.
For 33 years we prepared until finally we detected a distress beacon which you triggered when you accessed the ancient scout ship.
You led us here, Kal.
Now it's within your power to save what remains of your race.
On Krypton the genetic template for every being yet to be born is encoded in the registry of citizens.
Your father stole the registry's Codex and stored it in the capsule that brought you here.
For what purpose?
So that Krypton can live again on Earth.
Where is the Codex, Kal?
If Krypton lives again what happens to Earth?
The foundation has to be built on something.
Even your father recognized that.
No, Zod.
I can't be a part of this.
Then what can you be a part of?
Your father acquitted himself with honor, Kal.
You killed him?
I did.
And not a day goes by where it doesn't haunt me.
But if I had to do it again, I would.
I have a duty to my people and I will not allow anyone to prevent me from carrying it out.
What's the sit-rep, major?
DSP pinged two bogeys launching from the alien ship.
- Put it up. - Yes, sir.
There it is.
Re-task Ikon-4... - ...and get me a closer look. - Yes, sir.
Command, the word of the day is "trident."
We have two alien craft on aggressive approach.
Ikon-4 coming online.
Air speed?
380 knots, entering Kansas airspace.
Not responding to our hails.
You're wasting your efforts.
The strength you derived from the Earth's sun has been neutralized aboard our ship.
Here in this environment you are as weak as a human.
Where did you come from?
The command key, Miss Lane.
Thanks to you, I'm uploading to the ship's mainframe.
Who are you?
I am Kal's father.
Can you help us?
I designed this ship.
I can modify its atmospheric composition to human compatibility.
We can stop them. We can send them back to the Phantom Zone.
How?
I can teach you.
And in turn, you can teach Kal.
Will you help me?
The ship's crew are alerted.
We need to move quickly.
Retrieve the command key.
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up her sidearm.
What's happening?
To your right.
Fire.
Behind you.
Secure yourself inside the open pod.
Safe travels, Miss Lane.
It's highly unlikely we'll be seeing each other again.
Remember, the phantom drives are essential in stopping them.
Move your head to the left.
Is it true what Zod said about the Codex?
Strike that panel.
We wanted you to learn what it meant to be human first so that one day, when the time was right, you could be the bridge between two peoples.
Look.
Lois.
You can save her, Kal.
You can save all of them.
You'll be safe here.
- Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna tell them anything, but they did something to me.
- They looked inside my mind--
- It's okay, Lois.
They did the same thing to me.
The craft he arrived in where is it?
Go to hell.
There.
The Codex is not here.
Where has he hidden it?
I don't know.
Where is the Codex? !
You think you can threaten my mother? !
What have you done to me?
My parents taught me to hone my senses, Zod.
Focus on just what I wanted to see.
Without your helmet you're getting everything.
And it hurts doesn't it?
Get away from the window.
Get inside.
It's not safe.
All players, this is Guardian. I am airborne mission commander.
I have previously encountered and observed the beings we're about to engage.
They are extremely dangerous and we have been authorized to use deadly force.
Roger, Guardian, we are inbound to target.
Cleared hot. Weapons free.
Copy, 11. Weapons free.
Thunder 11 tally three targets.
Thunder 11 good hit.
Request immediate re-attack.
We'll make a second gun run on a heading of 212 degrees.
Thunder 11, eject! Eject!
Thunder 11, eject!
I have a bogey incoming!
You are weak son of El.
Unsure of yourself.
The fact that you possess a sense of morality and we do not gives us an evolutionary advantage.
And if history has proven anything it is that evolution always wins.
CCT, we're approaching LZ Jayhawk.
Get down in five.
Let's go. Go to the LZ.
All rangers, I need you to engage the targets.
Guardian, this is Badger 01. What about the guy in blue?
I said engage all targets.
Contact. Contact.
You okay?
We're auto-rotating, going in hard.
Brace for impact.
We're going in hard!
Fallen angel.
Fallen angel. Guardian is down.
I repeat, Guardian is down.
Guardian, do you read?
Thunder 12, calling Guardian.
- Do you read? - Thunder 12 this is Guardian.
Put down everything you've got north of my position.
- This will be danger-close.
- Copy, danger-close.
Good luck, sir.
A good death is its own reward.
You will not win.
For every human you save we will kill a million more.
Do we have an all clear?
Do we have an all clear?
Alpha team, sit-rep.
Alpha team. Do you copy?
Alpha team.
This man is not our enemy.
Thank you, colonel.
Mom?
I'm all right.
Nice suit, son.
I'm so sorry.
It's only stuff, Clark.
It can always be replaced.
But you can't be.
Mom, Zod said this Codex he's looking for can bring my people back.
Isn't that a good thing?
I don't think they're interested in sharing this world.
I know how to stop them.
What happened down there?
He exposed a temporary weakness.
It is of little consequence because I have located the Codex.
It was never in the capsule.
Jor-El took the Codex the DNA of a billion people, then he bonded it within his son's individual cells.
All of Krypton's heirs living hidden in one refugee's body.
Does Kal-El need to be alive for us to extract the Codex from his cells?
Release the world engine.
What just happened?
The ship just split in two.
Track one is heading east, track two to the southern hemisphere.
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching Mach 24 and accelerating.
It's gonna impact somewhere in the Indian Ocean.
The rest of the ship is descending.
Put it on the board now.
Yes, sir.
Bring the phantom drive online.
We are now slave to the world engine.
Initiate.
- What have they hit us with?
- Looks like some kind of gravity weapon.
It's working in tandem with their ship.
Somehow they're increasing the Earth's mass clouding the atmosphere with particulates.
They're terraforming.
What's that?
Planetary engineering modifying the Earth's atmosphere and topography.
Turning Earth into Krypton.
- But what happens to us?
- Based on these readings...
- ...there won't be an "us." - General Swanwick, sir.
I'm on with the control tower. Colonel Hardy's on his way and he's got Superman in tow.
Superman?
The alien, sir.
That's what they're calling him. Superman.
We have a plan, general.
Is that what I think it is?
It's the ship he arrived in.
This ship is powered by something called a phantom drive.
It bends space.
Zod's ship uses the same technology, and if we can make the two drives collide--
A singularity can be created.
- Like a black hole. - Yes.
So if we open up this doorway they should be pulled back in.
So you want us to bomb them with that?
General, that craft maxes out 17,000 pounds, we can drop it from a C-17.
It's a viable plan.
If I don't stop that machine over the Indian Ocean the gravity field will continue to expand.
If that thing is making Earth more like Krypton won't you be weaker around it?
Maybe.
I'm not about to let that stop me from trying.
You might want to step back a little bit.
Maybe a little bit more.
Faora.
Take command. - I need to secure the genesis chamber and pay my respects to an old friend.
Guardian en route to Metropolis package in tow.
Be advised, F-35s inbound to rendezvous point.
You should have visual contact now.
Command key accepted.
Genesis chamber coming online, sir.
Stop this, Zod while there's still time.
Haven't given up lecturing me, have you, even in death?
I will not let you use the Codex like this.
You don't have the power to stop me.
The command key I have entered is revoking your authority.
This ship is now under my control.
Northcom, Lightning 1, request... - ...permission to unleash the hounds. - Lightning 1 you are clear to engage.
Send battle damage assessment when able. Out.
Avionics are going haywire.
The gravity field is pulling our missiles down. We gotta get closer.
All right, everybody we're leaving.
We're leaving the building now.
I just lost my wingman.
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday!
Everybody, this way!
Come on!
Everybody, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving.
Jenny!
Perry!
Go! There! Go!
Our people can co-exist.
So we can suffer through years of pain trying to adapt like your son has?
- You're talking about genocide. - Yes.
And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost.
We're both ghosts, Zod.
Can't you see that?
The Krypton you're clinging onto is gone.
Ship, have you managed to quarantine this invasive intelligence?
- You'll fail.
- I have.
Then prepare to terminate it.
- I'm tired of this debate.
- Silencing me won't change anything.
My son is twice the man you were.
And he will finish what we started.
I can promise you that.
Tell me you have Jor-El's memories, his conscience.
Can you experience his pain?
I will harvest the Codex from your son's corpse and I will rebuild Krypton atop his bones.
- Jenny.
Jenny, where are you?
- I'm here!
- I'm here. Here. - Jenny.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm stuck.
- I can't get free. I'm stuck. - Okay.
We'll get you out of there, all right?
Just sit tight.
- Don't leave me.
- We're not gonna leave you.
- Lombard! - Get your ass over here and help me.
- Damn it.
- We just gotta move this.
- Here.
Slide that in.
You push, I'll pull, okay?
- Push!
- Oh, my God.
It's getting closer!
Come on, push!
Northcom, this is Guardian.
Are we cleared?
Negative, Guardian.
Come on! Push!
He did it.
Northcom, this is Guardian. We're passing through phase line red.
Good to go.
Godspeed, Guardian.
Arm the package.
You are cleared hot.
We're lining up for the final run.
It's up to you and Hamilton now.
You gotta be kidding me.
Loadmaster, is the package ready to drop?
Negative, Guardian.
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.
What's it supposed to do?
- It's supposed to go in all the way.
- Let me take a look.
Co-pilot's aircraft.
Co-pilot's aircraft.
We are lined up for the drop.
What's the hold up?
We've had a setback.
Target that aircraft.
Target locked.
Stop! If you destroy this ship you destroy Krypton!
Krypton had its chance.
It's not safe for you over there!
Miss Lane!
Move now! Go!
A good death is its own reward.
Are they gone?
I think so.
He saved us.
You know, they say it's all downhill after the first kiss.
I'm pretty sure that only counts when you're kissing a human.
Look at this.
We could have built a new Krypton in this squalor.
But you chose the humans over us.
I exist only to protect Krypton.
That is the sole purpose for which I was born.
And every action I take no matter how violent or how cruel is for the greater good of my people.
And now I have no people.
My soul that is what you have taken from me.
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.
These humans you've adopted, I will take them all from you... - You're a monster, Zod and I'm gonna stop you.
There's only one way this ends, Kal.
Either you die or I do.
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.
Trained my entire life to master my senses.
Where did you train?
On a farm?
If you love these people so much you can mourn for them.
Don't do this!
Stop!
Stop!
Never.
Are you effing stupid?
It's one of your surveillance drones.
That's a $12,000,000 piece of hardware.
It was.
I know you're trying to find out where I hang my cape.
- You won't.
- Then I'll ask the obvious question:
How do we know you won't one day act against America's interests?
I grew up in Kansas, general.
I'm about as American as it gets.
Look I'm here to help but it has to be on my own terms.
You have to convince Washington of that.
Even if I were willing to try, what makes you think they'd listen?
I don't know, general.
Guess I'll just have to trust you.
What are you smiling about?
Nothing, sir.
I just think he's kind of hot.
- Get in the car, captain.
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.
He always believed you were meant for greater things.
And that when the day came your shoulders would be able to bear the weight.
Yeah, I just wish he could have been here to see it finally happen.
He saw it, Clark, believe me.
What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually.
I gotta find a job where I can keep my ear to the ground.
Where people won't look twice when I want to go somewhere dangerous and start asking questions.
Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?
Courtside seats to the game tonight.
- What do you say?
- I say you should go back to trolling the intern pool.
You'll probably have more luck.
Sorry.
Courtside?
- Don't. - No.
Lombard, Lane, I want you to meet our new stringer.
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.
Good luck, kid.
Hey.
Steve.
- Nice to meet you. - You too.
Lois Lane.
Welcome to the Planet.
Glad to be here, Lois.
The wound canal is from a gunshot.
They thought you were dead. You were lucky.
Can you see?
That's good.
The patient has wound fever. Intravenous penicillin.
Cheekbone and nasal bone are shattered.
Chipping to the left cranial bone.
You were a singer?
Where was that?
Most recently at the St Michaels choir.
- In London?
Yes.
- When?
Up to '38.
Then you, a Jewess, returned here. Why?
They have wonderfully cool cellars. And there's a real plantation in the park.
We'll soon be able to walk around. And you'll be able to...
- Who's paying for this, Lene?
You?
- No.
You inherited.
Your entire family is dead.
And Herbert and Marie... the twins...
I haven't found her yet.
Where is Johnny?
So how do you want to look?
It's your choice.
Some of my patients favour Zarah Leander, others Miss Söderbaum.
I guess they're both out of fashion now. A few gentlemen out there would probably like new faces, too.
I want to look like I used to.
That's difficult. I recommend you think it over.
Why?
On the one hand, it's never quite the same, and on the other, a new face is an advantage.
How is it an advantage?
- You'll be a new and different person.
You won't be identifiable, which means...
I want to look exactly like I used to.
You'll receive an intravenous anaesthetic. An ether mask can't be used due to your face's condition, but don't be concerned, you'll sleep deeply.
Just count backwards: ten... nine, eight, etc.
Know what the Americans call it?
A "countdown".
It comes from a German film, "Woman in the Moon".
So now count, ten...
Ten.
- Nine...
Nine.
- Carry on.
Eight, seven... six, five...
JEW.
JEW.
JEW...
JOHANNES LENZ, PIANIST, DIVORCED OCTOBER, 04,1944
That's already looking really good.
A couple of days and the bandages come off.
I found an apartment, by the way. In Haifa.
You can see the sea.
Beautiful, simple-lined architecture.
Bernstein designed it.
I've got photos.
Want a look?
Here.
No, I didn't see him.
Nelly, it was bombed out. It no longer exists.
I no longer exist.
Nelly, remember how you felt three months ago?
How desperate you were?
It's extraordinary what Dr Bongartz... In a few days the bandages come off...
- Would you recognise me?
Would you recognise me?
Yes.
No.
This is me.
Where did you get that?
The clinic needed pictures for the reconstruction.
Sorry, that's the wrong word.
Dr Bongartz used it and I simply...
Re-creation is better, right?
- Re-creation.
Just look at me.
Nelly, you're beautiful.
That's not the point.
What do the circles signify?
Those are Nazis.
And the crosses are for the dead?
Yes.
We need a cross above Esther, too.
It's such a miracle you survived.
There's no cross above Johnny.
Johnny doesn't interest me.
Here are dresses, a jacket of English cloth, and there are two coats, a summer one and a lined one, to get you started. It was all acquired by Mrs Winter.
Wonderful cloth.
You're a size 38, right?
And when are you going to Palestine?
I don't know yet.
So, this is the bathroom, all fully equipped, and in perfect working order.
If you need anything, please let me know.
No, that we won't do.
The light stays off.
We have a real plague of flies.
The war didn't seem to bother them at all.
They come up from the lake in swarms.
No, please don't, I'd rather do it myself.
When do we dine, Elisabeth?
- At seven, if it please you, Ma'am.
What have you cooked for us?
- Stuffed cabbage with sweetbread.
Where did the sweetbread come from?
I have no nutmeg, no butter, no black pepper, it's awful.
But you improvise so wonderfully.
Improvise, improvise!
I've had it with improvising.
Elisabeth is really a gem.
She's not a Nazi?
- She always hated the Nazis.
So, you like it?
Yes.
Great.
By the way, I put the papers for the Haifa apartment on the desk.
And I found two other for us in Tel Aviv.
One is on a housing project. We're being allocated terrain.
You know, it wasn't easy getting us both a visa.
So, there.
- Thank you, Elisabeth.
Can you manage?
Yes.
Can I hear that again?
It's nice, huh?
I'd listened to it in London before falling asleep.
Would you sing it for me?
Okay.
I can't stand German songs anymore.
When you're better, we'll take care of your assets.
Is it a lot?
They're substantial. It'll take a while... to get the Nazis out of the properties, but there's lots of money in Switzerland.
It's the victims' money, it brings an obligation.
To do what?
To go to Palestine and found a state where we Jews can live safely.
To do so, we take back all they took away.
Maybe then we can sing and hear German songs again.
Did you like it?
Yes.
Then give me something.
Yes.
I'm looking for my husband. He's a musician, too.
What does he play?
He's a pianist.
If he's lucky, he'll be in one of the cabarets or clubs.
If not, he'll be on the corner with an accordion.
What clubs?
I'd try the American sector.
Johnny, what did I do?
I just wanted to dance a bit.
Let go of me!
Johnny!
Get off me!
Yes.
Excuse me. I mistook you for someone.
Stay where you are.
I told you to stop right there.
What do you have in your bag?
Show me.
The fine coat!
I'll never remove that.
That's tar.
Where was she gallivanting?
Would you leave us for a moment, Elisabeth?
So, did you meet him?
You can't just wander around at night. There are all sorts out.
I don't go out without a revolver.
I can't always look after you, I have to go to Poland soon.
I might be there a while.
- How long?
A week, two, maybe longer.
Did you give thought to Haifa or Tel Aviv?
In Tel Aviv there's a Jewish choir run by Vera Stroux.
It might suit you.
- What would I do in a Jewish choir?
I'm not a Jew.
- You are, like it or not.
They tried to kill you because you're a Jew.
We can't remain here, Nelly.
Johnny betrayed you.
You were arrested on October 6, 1944.
Johnny was arrested on October 4, 1944.
He was interrogated and released just after your arrest on October 6.
He wasn't put in prison. No punishment. Indeed... he was allowed to play again...
now he wants your money. Did you see him?
Yes.
- When?
Two months ago.
Did you speak to him?
I don't speak to traitors.
Shop window mannequin.
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
We have beer.
We have cold beer.
We have whisky.
We have champagne.
And now our delightful Vicky and Lola will sing the one and only Cole Porter's...
"Night and Day".
Night and day.
Johnny!
Nelly?
Everything okay?
Yes.
One second, I'll be right back.
I got you a revolver, too.
Know how to use it?
Sometimes just showing it is enough.
I'm looking for Johnny.
Did he gave you those black eyes?
He works here.
There's no Johnny here.
But I saw him.
- I don't know a Johnny. Do you?
Johnny, you swine, your pockets are empty
But the cellar is full, so really there's plenty
The world is a quay all covered with girls
The sailors go cross-eyed when they give them a twirl
How about a coffee?
- Or two?
Coming up.
- Are you Johnny?
The doll here wants work.
- But don't hit her again.
Johannes, get a move on!
He's the one to speak to, Miss.
Are you looking for work?
Do you have an apartment?
All of your own?
Wait, Miss.
This way, Miss. I don't have much time.
We can earn a lot of money.
You look very similar to someone.
To whom?
- My wife.
Alive she was poor, dead, she's rich.
What?
Why?
She and all her family were killed.
This way.
You can have the backroom.
I sleep here.
I can't get her inheritance.
There's no evidence she's dead.
Maybe she's still alive.
- She's dead.
You have to play my wife.
I'll instruct you. You'll return as a survivor, and collect her estate.
We'll split it.
There's 20,000 dollars in it for you.
But you can't go out over the coming weeks.
Nobody may see you.
I'll take care of food.
There's an American beer there.
- Johnny! Please don't call me that.
And... what should I call you?
Johannes.
You'll call me Johnny in public.
Until then it's Johannes.
- Public?
Yes, when you return as a survivor.
What's your name, anyway?
Esther.
There aren't many Esthers left.
What was your wife's name?
Nelly.
I'll be back at four.
Please let me sleep in.
Do I... really look similar to her?
No. But you will.
Lene?
Lene!
Nelly?
- Yes.
No, don't turn the light on.
You saw him.
Yes.
What happened?
It's open.
Please go back out.
Redo your entrance.
Come back in again.
Without the bag.
Don't look at me, Just come in and walk down the stairs.
Just carry on down the stairs.
Frankly I hoped you wouldn't come back.
Why?
- It won't work.
Here are two dollars.
And a ration card. I'm sorry.
Go on, take it.
Now leave.
But we wanted to practise!
- It won't work.
Why not?
- Because you won't cut it.
Now just take... Take the money and leave.
- We could at least try...
Take your bag.
- Just for a few days.
If it doesn't work, I'll leave.
Please.
Please.
Sit down on the other side.
Here's a specimen.
You must be able to write like her.
Practise it.
It's a shopping list.
Yes, it's what we'll start with.
Now practise.
Is that all you own?
I'll see what I can organise.
Practise.
There's some food left over.
Thanks.
You needn't have bothered.
There's no money in the draw.
What?
Oh, that.
I needed examples.
- Of what?
Her handwriting.
I'd finished the shopping list and needed more material.
It's... lying on the table.
You didn't trace it?
No.
200 G MARGARINE, 4 EGGS, SUGAR, RAISINS, 1 LEMON
Sit up.
I'll never get used to driving on the left.
Write it.
Oh, I see...
I'll never get used to driving on the left.
Write:
I am alive and will return soon.
Signed, Nelly Lenz.
This is her signature.
It's almost identical.
Good. You can sleep here, we'll continue tomorrow.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
I brought you some things.
Are they...
Nelly's things?
They were burnt.
There are only the shoes.
They are from Paris!
Try them on. Try the shoes.
Did you buy them for her?
- I think so.
Do they fit?
Did you go to Paris together?
I need to know these things.
- Try the other. Walk around in them.
Do they pinch?
So why are you walking so strangely?
We'll need to practise that, too.
I only just got up. I haven't had breakfast.
- The water's boiling. We'll eat soon.
Now please walk normally.
It's too long.
Can you sew?
I mean, take it in.
- The dress?
Her dresses ended just below the knee.
Always nice and short, broad and airy.
Can you manage that?
- Is that my coffee?
Your hair is awful.
Something's got to be done about it.
Nelly always dyed her hair.
Anything else?
- A hell of a lot.
We're only starting.
If we manage, I mean once we're done here, you'll take a train from the east and we'll meet you at the station.
And I'll be... in a red dress and shoes from Paris?
You think anyone leaves the camps like that?
Nobody will buy it.
You've seen the returnees.
All the burn wounds and shot-up faces!
No one looks at them. Everyone avoids them.
But we want them to look at you and say, it's Nelly!
Nelly made it!
She's back!
She's wearing a broad dress and nice shoes because she's so glad.
It's this that'll get us what we want.
This lot will be meeting you, and these you might meet after arrival.
Names and some details.
Learn it all by heart.
I'll be with you, I'll help.
If need be, throw a crying fit. As if you're overwhelmed.
Or just hug them, then I'll intervene.
We'll practise it.
The ones with crosses are dead.
Learn about them, anyway.
That one was shot in Lichtenberg. He was a Nazi.
This one?
- That one. And her, too.
Do you... have any photos of Nelly?
I'd so much like to see her.
Later. Study those ones now.
What colour eyes did Nelly have?
- Same as you. What colour is that?
- Blue.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I've found the solution for your hair.
It's not my wife, she's an actress.
Nelly really liked that picture.
The look of her make-up.
The hair. She copied it. Particularly for performances.
At all performances, in fact.
Think you can do it?
You know how to apply make-up, right?
I've brought you some.
And something for your hair. The colour should be right.
It won't work, it...
I can't come from a camp like that.
I explained that already.
- No, that's all...
They want Nelly, not a ragged camp-internee.
That's what we're working on here.
If I'm coming... from a camp, someone is bound to ask me
what I experienced there, what I...
What?
How it was there, and I'll need a story.
What? - Something or other. Like... how we sat on a beam,
naked and... went through the clothing of those who had just arrived, while the Kapos stood around us.
We had to check for banknotes, or jewels they'd hidden,
And then this... girl, this girl... looks at me. She looks at me.
This girl looks at me...
Where does the story come from?
- She's got her mother's dress...
Where from? - I...
I read it.
Then tell it. If anyone asks.
Yes.
But I assure you, no one will.
None of this lot will ask.
Right. No one.
You did well. With the dress.
Johnny!
- I said don't call me that.
Where are you going?
I've got to go out.
- I've got to go out, too.
Wait.
Do you recognise me?
Johnny.
Enough!
Enough!
What have you caked your face with?
The eye make-up is wrong. Your walk, too.
Everything.
It's all wrong.
Did you at least learn by heart?
I have to go out.
- No, no...
I must.
- You can't.
If you go and someone recognises you, it was all in vain.
- No one will.
I have to go out!
Please.
First the grocer wouldn't sell to us.
Then Mr Schmidt-Ott opposite.
Nelly was banned from singing. No friends came by anymore.
Sigrid and Walter Hochbaum lived on the third floor. They stopped coming, too.
I had to hide Nelly in winter '43.
Lehmann wouldn't let her in the bomb shelter.
We were sure he'd denounced Nelly soon. He envied us our apartment. A friend who died at the front had a houseboat on a nearby lake.
That's where I brought her.
How did we meet?
Put your hat on. People are coming.
Come on.
Did you often go walking with her.
- Yes.
At night?
That too, yes.
Where would you go to?
Did you have favourite places?
Of course.
What were they?
Let's go. The weather is turning.
- So?
Shall we go and sit down there?
Stop it!
Stop it!
What? - Stay away from the photos in my drawer.
Of course.
- Then do so!
I didn't look at them.
- Quit playing Nelly!
I know you're not her!
It's not me you must convince!
Where is your hat?
- On the bench.
Coming for a beer later on?
- Sure. Look!
How beautiful to be in love!
Here.
I'd not have survived the camp except for Johnny.
I only thought about how I'd come back to him.
And when I finally got here I simply had to look for him.
And when I finally found him he didn't recognise me. And it was...
Lene, it was...
I was... dead again. And... now he's made me back into Nelly again.
I can't come to Palestine.
Where will you go instead?
With Johnny... back with him.
- Impossible. Lene, since being back with him
I'm myself again.
When he speaks of her... - Of her! I'm really jealous... of me!
When will you tell him?
- I don't know.
Lene, it's as if we were just getting acquainted. For the first time, you hear?
And how is this to go on?
Soon I arrive by train. He'll inform you about it. Then I'll be here again.
That'll be my return.
- Then he'll go after your money.
Do you know what disgusts me?
We Jews wrote, sang and slaved... went to war for Germany, yet we were gassed, one and all.
And now the survivors return and forgive.
The gassing ceases and we forgive... all counts of cowardice and treachery.
I won't go along with it, Nelly.
Lene, I know he loves her.
I don't believe he betrayed her.
When you were sitting in the dark I thought you'd shot him and needed my help.
And honestly, I'd have preferred that.
I'll wait for you here.
Mrs Lenz!
I'm so happy to see you again.
Is your husband, too?
You know how men are these days.
And how are they?
Can I offer you something?
We have real coffee... for our good guests.
Elsie, make us a coffee.
Did you know I was hiding down in the boat?
No.
No.
I saw you... at the window... when I was arrested.
It was horrific.
What could we have done?
I said the same to your husband.
We were so afraid.
And you know our son...
- My... husband was here again?
Yes, after your arrest.
When?
Right away.
What are you doing here?
It must... have been cold that winter.
How was it with the innkeepers?
You were right. The landlady didn't ask me about the camps.
But she did call me Mrs Lenz. And she cried.
You were here the day Nelly was arrested?
Says who?
The landlady.
Let's go.
Did you betray Nelly?
Sometimes... it's not a real betrayal.
You hid her... had to take care of her all that time...
Then came arrest and interrogation. Finally you are suddenly released. You hurry to check up on her.
You don't notice you're being followed.
Then it's too late.
You just stand there and there's nothing you can do.
You have to watch Nelly being taken away.
Get off.
Come along.
We'll have Nelly return next week.
At the station there'll be me,
Sigrid, Monika,
Frederike, Walther and Alfred. A train will arrive, many people will get off.
You'll be sitting to the rear. The train will start to move, then they will see you... in the red dress... and the shoes from Paris.
The Nelly of the past.
They will be relieved. They'll run towards you.
Sigrid will be first. She always is.
She'll pretend to be speechless:
"I don't believe it."
"Nelly!" Then she'll hug you.
Alfred, as ever, will say, "Little Nelly."
It might almost be, "How you've grown."
Monika will tell you about her husband.
"I always knew you'd come back."
Frederike will complain as usual about her life and Berlin.
What about us?
We'll walk up to each other. Very tentatively.
We won't speak... kiss or fall upon each other.
We will simply hug.
You'll lay your head on my shoulder and we'll both shut our eyes.
We'll do nothing else.
Nothing. For ages.
REFERENCE.
MRS SCHWARZ WAS IN MY EMPLOY FROM MARCH TO SEPTEMBER, 1945.
SHE IS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER...
She left you a letter, too.
I am to give it to you.
But where is Lene, then?
You don't know?
Mrs Winter shot herself on Thursday.
Dear Nelly,
I told you there is no way back for us. But for me there's no way forwards, either.
I feel more drawn to our dead than to our living.
I cannot keep this from you.
Your husband divorced you directly before your arrest.
I enclose a copy of the relevant document.
Farewell,
Lene
Wait. I'll get the key.
The train arrives around eight. Is half an hour enough... for a wash, make-up and hair?
Or do you need three-quarters?
Well, Nelly?
Calling me that, now?
A slip, I guess.
I'm afraid this will hurt a little.
Prisoners of Auschwitz were tattooed. With a number on the forearm.
Someone will ask about your number. And you'll whisper... that you cut it out.
There'll be no further questions.
Get out.
IN THE NAME OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE! OCTOBER 4, 1944...
JOHANNES LENZ...
DIVORCE...
NELLY LENZ
I don't believe it.
It's so...
I don't know...
Come have a hug.
I told Wolfgang...
Nelly will be back, I know it.
If only he could see you, too...
If...
Well, Nelly...
Christina is dead.
My child is dead.
But now go over to Johnny. There he is.
Let's go, kids. The food's getting cold.
We missed you.
Two days ago I passed the studio.
The circular bench where you always sat together.
The street lighting was back on. A piano was playing inside. Someone was singing.
I shut my eyes. And for an instant it was as it used to be.
Yes... And now here you are, Nelly.
I don't have to close my eyes to see you. And I never will again.
To your being back again, Nelly.
To Nelly.
- To Nelly.
-Cheers.
Nelly...
You are my love. You are my life.
No matter what.
Come on.
All of you come.
"Speak Low".
"Speak Low".
- Yes.
I always wished... to sing with Johnny again... one day... in Berlin...
BELOVED SISTERS
No, I like smoking myself.
In autumn 1787 young Charlotte von Lengefeld enters her godmother's service in Weimar.
her mother's ulterior motive that she find herself a man of noble birth and substantial wealth.
Charlotte is regarded as an obedient daughter who only does and says as she is told to do and say.
- That's Pyramus. The lion with the bloodstained veil in its mouth?
Frau von Stein, a bright star at Duke Carl August's court, has been much plagued by the departure of her famous poet friend to Italy a year ago.
Medea. She's killing her children.
Medea killing her children.
At first she's rather cool to her godchild.
Charlotte spends all winter learning manners with literary society, music and feasts at the court.
When spring arrives she's had many invitations, accepted most of them, danced abundantly and had many witty conversations.
But where and to whom life is taking her:
she's less certain of this now than on the day she arrived. The tone of her letters changes.
In spring 1788, only a single Scottish captain remains, who beleaguers her with his affections.
"Beloved, dearly missed Caroline, I must report to you the incident of Frau von Werthausen's mistaken funeral.
Old Herr von Werthausen's young wife was in good health at a party one evening, when at noon next day, her spouse was told of her sudden death.
The old man hurried home and found his wife already in a coffin, allegedly to ward off an epidemic.
He wept, had her laid out in a closed coffin and buried three days later.
But his sister had noticed that a certain Marquis von Bernbach, who'd got on so well with Frau von Werthausen these past weeks, had suddenly disappeared, just like half the young woman's wardrobe.
When the couple's escape was uncovered and the grave was opened, they found, instead of her,
a life-sized doll.
Behind closed doors this episode is considered admirable, showing international ﬂair.
On top of that it opens up an unexpected wealth of ideas of how to escape a tiresome marriage in case of emergency. Tu comprends?"
Anyone there who knows the way? Can anyone hear me?
I'm lost. Do you know the way to the market square? Certainly.
How can that be? I came this way.
And now I'm here. No, over there. - Where?
Can women read maps then?
Doesn't it take the strategic grasp and creative will of a man?
Like those needed to wage war?
That's right. You're mistaken, we're not here.
You're mistaken too, or you wouldn't be lost.
True. I'll yield and give it a try.
If you're wrong, I'll hold you responsible.
Even though we'll spend the season next door to a madhouse because no other mansion with a garden was for rent in this town, that, my dear child, is no reason to behave in such a way
that passers-by mistake our house for said institution.
Which they will, if a young lady of high rank talks to them like some kitchen maid.
But most of all, Lollo, never daily with a man at the back door while another is waiting at the front.
Tell the Captain we will see him now.
Would there be a possibility of taking out Fräulein von Lengefeld for a walk through the "Geholz" grove?
SPRING 1788, RUDOLSTADT
"Thanks, dear Lollo, for the idea of feigning one's death to escape an unwanted marriage, but it isn't that bad with Beulwitz.
I've been thinking a lot about our secret oath, Lollo, that we swore amid the uproar of the Schaffhausen Falls five years ago." Caroline von Beulwitz, née von Lengefeld, writes her sister how, in May 1783, five years earlier and only meant for Charlotte to hear, she cried out her life plan above the water.
Yes, she will marry Friedrich von Beulwitz to ensure financial security for her mother and Charlotte, but she plans to live an independent life under the yoke of a forced marriage, to organize festivities and receive great poets and artists.
But most of all, her sister must never leave her alone. Swear it on the roaring water's spirit. I swear!
"You alone know I could only accept Beulwitz with you in my heart as sister and companion.
I miss you, Dearest. I miss you every single day. And I look forward to seeing you and the Englishman in the red coat.
P.S. Sorry. I know he is a Scotsman."
I've made some inquiries.
Mr. Heron left for Berlin yesterday.
He wants to go to India to lead the heroic life of a soldier, as he told us at some length in his farewell letter.
- Is one to believe that? - One should believe it.
Or one would make room for other assumptions.
The fact is, Lollo, the nice Scotsman stood you up.
He may have written you many nice English verses, and he wants to visit you on his return, but...
Charlotte still doesn't realize her market value. She shows no ambition to seem alluring in society or in general.
It's très sympathique but not very promising.
Maybe one should encourage her? Yes.
All right, her conversational skills are poor.
Wit isn't her strong suit, but the way she behaves, she's selling herself short.
It's not at all what you think.
I'm not sad about the Captain.
- Then why? - I'm just so ashamed.
Because Maman sent me here, and all the clothes you bought me. Your husband too, and I'm supposed to find a well-situated husband.
Now I can't even hold on to this English war-horse.
- Didn't you want him then? - No.
No, for heaven's sake.
But I would have married him.
If you'd all persuaded me, "Marry him, you won't find anyone better."
We certainly wouldn't have done that. You should find someone you love.
You baby. Our father was a poor, ailing man. He was paralyzed.
Of everything.
Of people, nature...
Not like these vipers at court who judge everything and weigh every word.
Haven't you met a single young man here in Weimar whom you like?
On the day of her return home,
Caroline finds a two-week old letter on her sister's desk from a Herr Friedrich Schiller, telling Charlotte that after their first meeting at her window he had often looked out for her there, that he knew who she was
and asked her to signal that they could meet again.
Without hesitation Caroline writes him a reply.
"Herr Friedrich Schiller, Weimar, Am Frauenplan.
It strikes me that the two of you got on well at once.
I worry a bit about my little sister. Could you look after her a little?"
Frau von Stein, I request permission to take Fräulein Lengefeld out for an afternoon. With a chaperone and on your terms, of course. "Don't tell her I wrote to you.
But, if you like, you can visit us in Rudolstadt in the summer.
Our mother, who lives with my husband and me, would certainly be thrilled to meet such a famous poet, whose play 'The Robbers' has made him rather notorious.
Rudolstadt is a day's journey south of here. A peaceful little Duchy. You could come and stir it up a bit."
it's a wood engraving, a relief print. It allows more contrast and bigger black areas. Charlotte, look at this lettering from France, the Didot typeface.
It's crystal clear. Look.
Revolutionary.
Its clarity makes it easier to read. This is how it looks in print.
Imagine if one day everyone could read, understand and buy a book.
Afford one. That one day books might be affordable for everyone.
Ideas bound for all. The idea alone makes me giddy every time. I think humanity will evolve through knowledge and the sight of true beauty.
We, Charlotte, you and I, will see a new world in our lifetime. Your coat's torn.
Here too. Give it to me.
I'll mend it.
You'll get it back next time.
Good-bye.
- Madame wants to see you. - What is it?
She's received a letter from Italy, from Goethe.
"Herr von Goethe."
- When? - This afternoon, while you were out.
He's not coming back.
He won't come back to me.
Get out. Get out!
Maybe such experiences made Charlotte feel that sacrifice and loss prevail in the greatest of loves and that an unhappy love adorns the sufferer with an aura of beauty.
She doesn't always like her godmother but admires her for the difficult path she chose for her great friend Goethe.
Now she hears the music of tragedy.
Tomorrow afternoon. If the coach is on time. - Where will he stay?
A lovely walk. The worse off we are financially, the more important our reputation becomes.
Dearest, anything to add on the subject of Schiller? Yes.
On account of his famous revolutionary drama about the rebel "Robbers", an undeserved reputation precedes him.
He's a young man, driven by excessive ardor. But no reason to worry. He's a poet and a gentleman.
And prevent him from turning the big historico-political wheel, because he won't stop talking.
But otherwise he's a most well-behaved pet for your daughters.
What's the matter?
He may expect too much of us. What if he gets bored?
Don't worry. We'll see what happens when he gets here.
He's likely to send a message every morning saying when we can expect him.
He'll want to work until noon. So we'll expect him in the early afternoon and watch him walking along the river.
Let's see how long it takes that person to get from the bridge to here.
Starting now. He's very sluggish.
Schiller walks differently. All right, we'll deduct some time. When we see him coming we'll put some new books on the table.
Over there too. Different ones every day. If the weather's nice we'll serve drinks in the garden.
Look, now he'd be by the bridge. You'd have plenty of time to put on your wig.
- I never wear wigs. - Or tweak your red cheeks.
Where'd he be now? - By the bench.
- He could see us. Get away from the window.
- He mustn't know that we're waiting.
- No. Turn your back to him at the most. We're glad, not desperate, to see him.
Women can't offer themselves like sour milk, you know? Lotte?
Forgive me, I mistook you for someone else.
Don't look so disappointed, Herr Schiller. Here she is.
But she's Lollo here, not Lotte.
- You're one day early. - I know.
Don't be so stern.
Thank you.
And the room in Volkstedt? Is it good? Yes.
Even though I was one day early.
Pleasant people.
I already had coffee.
Incredible that I mixed up the dates. Yes, incredible.
We must introduce you to our mother now.
Especially the color accuracy is great.
This will be the first volume of the deceased Herr von Lengefeld's silvicultural writings. The advance copy has been printed.
We just corrected the proof and checked it against the original manuscripts.
This is your father's handwriting?
Very expressive.
You can't read the scrawl at times.
Dearest, this matter is for close family only.
S'il vous plaît.
You live in the front house, Madame? No. But I receive guests in my son-in-law's quarters.
He is away. In Berlin.
Since my husband's death, more than ten years ago, we've accepted compromises in our lifestyle. Herr von Beulwitz is wealthy?
From a well-to-do house.
He now holds a good position as chamberlain with Prince Schwarzburg.
He's about to become a privy legation councillor.
And yes, as you may suspect, Herr Schiller, one can't say his superb prospects were an obstacle to a union with my daughter.
All right, he's most sympathetic, but he has no taste and no money.
He looks like a beggar.
The man's a pauper.
Maybe he thinks he stands to gain something here.
Did you purposely let him think that, Charlotte?
I don't need to lie to be a good catch, Maman. Everyone knows we don't exactly eat off gold plates.
Herr Schiller's sympathy that I'm allowed to experience isn't calculated.
He is a great poet. I'm proud he's staying with us. And I consider him a friend.
- Maman, the man speaks French. - Yes, I speak French. Because French is the language of the great...
Enlightenment.
"Bring light into the world," the new age tells us.
The noblest achievement of the Enlightenment is a free treatment of nature and its sources of life.
Your husband, as the Prince's forest manager, was a beacon of progress in this respect.
He saw the blessings of nature through cleansed eyes.
Count von Lengefeld's fame extends even to the King of Prussia. My husband wasn't a count.
And there's no need for ﬂattery.
I want to see my daughter's future in bright colors, Herr Schiller. Yes, that's understandable.
When my husband died
Charlotte asked me every single day, she was eight at the time,
"Maman, are we poor new?"
I said, "Can't you differentiate between a common man's poverty and ours?
We're poor when we only have one of our twelve 26-piece dinner sets left.
We are poor when we have to live in a house where we each have only one room and just three servants."
That's what I told her. And now? What are we left with?
The rear house. Herr Schiller, my daughters deserve a life without worries.
Italy.
Yes.
He's there.
I'll never get there.
He's on the way back.
When I left Frau von Stein in Weimar, his last letter came from Meran.
"Every afternoon the sisters pick me up at a bridge over the Saale outside town and lead me to their home for the rest of the day and evening, looking like two river goddesses at the gates of some paradise which will open up to me one day too.
Charlotte was 'Wisdom', Caroline 'Ardor'.
Sorry, Wilhelm, I know I promised you a classic tragedy and half a dozen poems if you found me a woman with a 12,000-taler dowry soon, but now I'm happy and confused.
The sisters have no money either. Still, the summer and this river...
Doggie.
- Help, help! - She's drowning. - Help!
- Can he swim? - Help.
Can you swim? No.
Come here. Come to me!
I'll hold you.
- This way. - Take the child!
- Get her.
- Take her hand.
Fritz, I'm over here.
Fritz!
I've got you.
Hang on.
Ida Marie.
- You have to get warm.
Don't be foolish, you'll catch your death.
Keep him warm.
Right. "On the 27th of last month."
It's a code. We need several letters to decipher it.
No problem. They receive two a day.
I'll try and memorize the symbols until the next letter arrives.
Your daughters may have modified the code by then.
What's all this nonsense?
Has everyone gone mad? The heat, Madame. Careful.
- Nonsense. - They mustn't notice.
"Dear II, the performance was postponed at the time..."
And here we are.
Now the three of them will become one, observing the three stages of approach as described by Madame de Scudéry.
Are you strong enough to put up with both of us?
Are we annoying you?
We've just arrived.
How can we be annoying him?
The suspect has a severe chill after saving someones life.
One. This is an opportune moment.
Corporal, spread out.
The accused had better pray to God that we find nothing but virtuous literary works in your cell and no perfumed love letters.
"The Revolt of the Netherlands". Will you read to us from this once you're back in our garden?
What's this?
Madame von Kalb? Two. Isn't she married?
- To Herr von Kalb? I see.
"Esteemed young Master..."
No indiscretions at first glance.
Something about literature.
How about yours?
Let's check the next one.
Is this right? Lollo. Madame von Kalb cites a letter that you, Herr Schiller, allegedly wrote to your friend Körner.
She quotes the following:
"It's a dutiful wife you want..."
And then, "No passion must be involved in an eternal union."
Körner is a good fellow.
He keeps accusing me of getting lazy. I wanted to reassure him.
How come Frau von Kalb knows about it?
She was present when I wrote to Körner.
- Present?
- She teased me about it.
What's the nature of your relationship with Frau von Kalb? Accused? Quick!
- Her husband regards me highly. - For cheating on him with his wife?
That's true. At court they say Herr von Kalb approves of his wife's friendship with Schiller.
Friendship?
Tacit approval at court makes this indelicacy no better.
I'm not asking for acquittal. And I don't care about the Weimar court.
It isn't my world.
Irony, coquetry, I'm too plain for all that.
Not plain. You are honest. That's not the same.
Three.
Lollo, I can hardly imagine you like the rarefied air of Weimar, even if we met there.
Isn't everything that truly affects our soul, nature and naturalness, like a beautiful melody?
Isn't it financial need that drives us into the world of false notes?
The lies, the unnatural play-acting at court?
We suffocate in that society.
Soon we no longer know what we feel or what we want.
He's showing remorse.
A fellow like me gets from life what he least expected.
I love you both.
Caroline, Charlotte.
I can't imagine leaving your side.
Forgive me.
Come in.
Good afternoon.
Caroline.
Maman.
We have to talk.
Come on. Right away.
He's heard in Berlin, God knows if it's true, but never mind, that Herr Schiller is a guest in our house and also that the mood is joyous while he's away.
He demands that I remind you to consider both your reputations and your marriage.
- Speak French, Caroline!
I don't want every servant repeating this conversation.
Close the window.
The children's games you play. Letters in a secret language.
The absurd veiled performance two days ago at Monsieur Schiller's in Volkstedt. The public embarrassment with the child at the river last week that every idiot in Rudolstadt heard about, even the Prince's family.
What else could we have done?
Let the child drown?
- Monsieur Schiller...
- Monsieur Schiller! This Monsieur Schiller is...
Caroline, your marriage with Friedrich von Beulwitz saved us. We'll never forget that, your sister and I. I know it was hard on you.
It wasn't a marriage for love but out of financial need.
As a young girl I was lucky.
I was allowed to marry your father for love.
I don't know anything about money.
It is said there are good marriages based on money, better than some based on love.
Not in your case, unfortunately.
Your sister and I are eternally indebted to you.
No, I... We'd scrub your salon on bare knees if you like!
We owe it to you.
But don't jeopardize your marriage.
We'd have to go begging, all three of us.
No.
I know you're unhappy in this union.
Your husband is an evil elephant. He knows nothing about women.
On top of that he wants a dozen children, but only because he won't come into his father's inheritance otherwise.
Yes and no.
It's not just that, he keeps pestering me.
But a divorce, if that's what you have in mind, is out of the question.
Your sister was so badly humiliated in Weimar.
Don't hurt her again.
Keep away from this Schiller.
It's important when you love that there are obstacles to be overcome.
The two sisters and the young man were like three sides of a triangle.
To them, the absent Herr von Beulwitz is like an invisible enemy who will show up soon.
Schiller would gladly use both hands when writing each sister twice a day. He's keen on preventing any kind of competition between them, so he sends them the same lines.
He writes that they've chosen an earthling whose health is heavily compromised every spring and autumn.
That he's now medically banned from the water, the river goddesses' element. He can't swim anyway, as they'd seen.
And that he'd be fine again in two days expecting them at a conspiratorial place. Come. Come.
Charlotte, remember the wonderful Didot typeface in Weimar? Look at these clumsy German letters. French printing is so much more advanced.
We're still at the level of the Thirty Years' War.
There's news.
The two sisters and their mother stand to inherit a substantial sum from a deceased very wealthy merchant from Batavia.
A man who hadn't only been a very successful tradesman but also an eminent authority on the study of jungle apes.
Caroline and Charlotte immediately make plans for the expected money, the objective of which is a happy life with Schiller as a threesome.
One day I'll write a book too. About the love we three shared. I'll call it, "Under the Waterfall".
Lollo, we must lay down a plan.
We'll let Maman have the Batavia inheritance on condition that she use it to set up a new household.
Weimar would be best. She always wanted to go there.
- By herself? - Maybe with Knebel. She doesn't want him.
What's going on in there now? What is this? That will change his mind.
I'm moved and touched like never before. I love him. Just like you do.
How will we explain our get-togethers?
Your husband won't allow a free thinker or male competition.
I'll do anything for you.
You two would marry to save the love we three share. Will Maman permit it?
That's interesting, but...
Here. - It pricks. - Yes, but it smells good.
Madame, compose yourself.
This is where we grew up.
A few years back the new owner went bankrupt and moved away.
In the spring the house burnt down.
We'd heard about it, but hadn't seen the house yet. Maman, with the Batavian inheritance you could buy it and rebuild it.
- And who would live here?
By myself?
Come here.
That's no good.
Remind me of that if I consider letting him into my bed after 10 glasses of port.
My husband was much older than me too.
But he's said to have been a great man. Clever and funny.
That's where the spinet was.
Papa's portrait was here.
Wasn't the dining table here?
Schiller, do you think the ladies would prefer to sit facing away from the house?
I know what you're planning.
You want to get rid of me and the inheritance.
Sorry? Motschekiebchen. It's what you call them here.
- Motschekiebchen. - Ladybird.
When the sky was this color my mother used to say, "The Swedes are coming."
"The Swedes are coming". That's interesting.
That's what stuck with people. The Swedes and their raids that started out with heavy blazes.
What a time, the Thirty Years' War.
So ill that he had to send each of you two notes a day. So tell me, Schiller, when will you enlighten us about the meaning of two slashes, a triangle and a circle?
In our family all emotions are out in the open.
You just have to learn to see and feel them.
We're enjoying a moment at our old home.
However sad, it is also uplifting to be close to our childhood and our father.
Oh, how well I feel in the evening
In the evening
- When bells ring for repose - Oh, how well I feel in the evening
Remember? Up there was our playroom. We used to have a nanny.
Maman, what was her name? - Friederike. - Right.
Did you have a happy home, Schiller?
It was small. It didn't leave you much time to wonder about being happy.
Looking back, I feel it was a good place. Strange.
Looking back, everything seems good.
It seems man has a great talent for lying to himself.
I'm sometimes overcome by a desire to go back to Württemberg. The Duke's ban against me has lasted for so long now.
How long exactly? I had to ﬂee from my homeland six years ago.
I apologize for asking that.
How insensitive of me.
There's an unrest in the air.
A message for you from Milady.
I'm to join Frau von Stein in Kochberg at once.
Goethe's back and has announced himself for tomorrow.
Goethe's back?
- Insist that she returns late August. - What about the hats? - Late summer is the best season.
- Have you got the hats and the red case?
Did you pack the present for Madame von Stein?
Did you pack it?
And the festive dresses, Charlotte's festive dresses... - Schwenke, are you sure? - Yes, Madame, I'm sure.
Forgive me.
- Did you pack them? - Yes, I packed the hats, Madame.
Trust me, it will all turn out as we discussed.
- Madame.
- Our Father who art in Heaven...
When ready, put out the candles and go to bed.
Very well, Madame. You too.
Good night.
Go to sleep, Wilhelm.
I won't be needing you. And take the light with you.
Good night.
- Shall I go home?
- It's much too late for that.
Please read what I laid out on the table for you.
It's the start of a novelette of mine.
To boost your honesty, I'll make us some punch.
It's my mother's recipe, who had it from her mother and so on.
Originally my mother only wanted to reveal the recipe in her will.
But she blabbed during an afternoon nap.
But if you were to have any, Fritz, I'd leave the recipe to them. - If they're nice children.
- Children... Never thought about them. I'd like to call you Fritz.
My husband's name is Friedrich, and tonight I don't want to say his name.
Go to Charlotte in Weimar.
Offer to marry her.
You'll be happy.
What will become of our triangle?
I told Lollo I won't be losing a sister but gaining a brother.
I won't relinquish you.
I can offer you a deepening of our friendship tonight.
But...
If he says he'll be here in the afternoon, he arrives in the morning.
It's always like that.
Et voilà. Yes? Quick, Madame.
Your mother met your husband at a coach stand this morning.
She sent me ahead in secret. - Does he suspect anything? - Your mother said he looked opaque.
- Am I hurting you?
- No, no. It's all very enjoyable.
Love of my life, now leave me so you can return.
When?
- Where's my wife?
- Asleep. Stay, I'll go to her.
She sleeps in the rear house in her sister's room.
"Last night, or rather this morning, things were beyond my control, and this evening lma y be invited to a late dinner by Rengmann, the doctor who's been treating me here, but later on I will try to steal away to you."
"No, I implore you, stay away from our house today and the next few days.
But you're invited to come next Sunday, because then, if I read all the signs correctly, you will meet a certain man who has been avoiding you until now."
- I think he just said "world".
You'd need a lip reader.
Schiller wears his frock as if he'd found it on a compost heap.
- Yet it wasn't cheap.
- But second-hand.
Should I have bought him a new one?
Poets.
However you dress them, they still look like beggars. Show a little generosity.
The Prince!
Those two are among the most important people of our age.
When the two great poets first meet, a humid, late-summer sun shines on the Saale.
Schiller freezes nonetheless, and Goethe talks verbosely to overcome the awkwardness between them.
The younger one feels as if he's standing before a craggy rock-face.
Charlotte, who'd come to Rudolstadt with Frau von Stein for a day, leaves her sister saying, "That wasn't his happiest day. In future we must' protect him and support' him when he is lonely."
Caroline agrees.
That same evening Goethe leaves for Weimar with Knebel and Madame Stein, citing important business.
It leaves a tone in the air that instills in Schiller an impression of rejection and non-recognition.
"The presumptuousness of the Inquisition verdicts could only be surpassed by the inhumanity of their enforcement.
By joining the risible and the frightful, they drown pity in mockery and contempt.
With pomp the criminal was led to his place of execution, a red banner leading the way.
The ringing of all bells accompanied the procession.
First came a priest in his chasuble, followed by the sinner in a yellow garment decorated with black devils. On his head a paper hat.
Facing away from the condemned: the image of Christ on the cross.
He could no longer expect salvation.
His mortal ﬂesh belonged to the fire, his immortal soul to the ﬂames of Hell.
A gag blocked his mouth.
You'd have thought it was a corpse being led to its grave, yet it was a living man whose torments were to gruesomely entertain the people."
Forgive me, I'll break off here.
Will you amuse us now with details of an execution during the Inquisition?
No, I beg your pardon.
I'm deeply impressed.
Your language has clarity and force.
Where can the book be ordered?
Beg your pardon. The book comes out in Weimar in the autumn.
Why aren't you teaching in Jena?
Or Berlin?
No one describes history in German like you do.
At least I haven't read anything like it.
So literally true.
I actually applied in Jena.
This book, or rather the research for it, was the basis for my play "Don Carlos".
His art even scares our Weimar Giant. That's why he left here in such a hurry.
My dear Herr Wolzogen, there's no need to promote your friend.
He has put me under his spell.
May I excuse myself?
I'm having trouble speaking today.
I don't want to be a burden to you.
Well, he has no manners.
- Am I that boring? - No.
The rest of us are boring.
You showed him your admiration.
Thank you.
But I'm enthralled by his writing.
I'll see if his toothache hasn't caused our friend to fall down the stairs.
Friedrich.
Sorry.
"Propose to 'Triangle' in Weimar. Don't forget.
Eternally grateful, 'Circle.'"
Having returned to his poet's life in Weimar, Schiller is reproached by his worried friends, especially the loyal Körner.
I advise you not to end your relationship with Madame von Kalb.
I want to stand on my own two feet. And stop shouting.
What you need is free time without worries.
That's exactly what von Kalb gave you.
It's obvious I can't let any decision on how to behave depend on advice. You never met the sisters.
All bitterness in my life has one cause:
I thought I was not suited to love.
But this summer I started to doubt this unsuitability for the first time.
It made me happy.
Come here.
That's why I ask you alone and before God if you have even the slightest inclination to become my wife. Yes.
No.
What is it?
Do you love me? Didn't I say so?
Charlotte, yes, it's the truth. But does love torment you so?
- It's the inheritance from Batavia. - What about it?
It prevents me from showing you my love.
I constantly hear new plans being made with it.
The poor beggar within me feels like a legacy hunter.
My love for you is unhesitating and true.
You can rely on me like a tree that looks strong and verdant every day. For you.
Never think that you hurt me. Be free with me.
Be with me the way you will.
There it is again:
the modesty and the wisdom.
- With ourselves and God as witnesses... - Yes? We are engaged.
And I'll make sure we get my mother's approval.
I will tell no one.
Not even a friend. But one person must know.
"Dearest Line.
We were all alone.
I 'd made sure no servant could surprise us.
Madame was still in Kochberg, so no one overheard our secret.
You, dearest Line, are the only one who knows.
I'm proud to tell you we didn't make fools of ourselves.
But a kneeling man is a strange sight. I had to join him so he didn't look silly."
"I'm so happy.
I will come soon, then we three can celebrate in secret.
But keep it quiet for now so nothing gets out and no tongues can wag."
"Do you want to speak to Maman about our marriage? When will you speak to Maman?"
"I haven't been able to talk to her since her return from Weimar. Her eyes hurt, and she was in a foul mood.
She wanted to go away with Knebel, but the roads were waterlogged and no coaches were running.
"Fritz and I see each other every day.
We're very loving to each other. When will you speak to Maman'? When are you coming?"
"Lollo, our oath still holds that we share everything, doesn't it?
- I share with yo u, and you with me?" - "That was our oath b y the Rhine Falls." "But will it hold? Will it hold, Lollo?"
"Do you think Fritz will ever be acceptable to Maman?
His imminent professorship in Jena is now being openly discussed here.
Will this little financial security make him eligible to Maman?"
"I wouldn't tell her yet. He has no official appointment in Jena.
And you know the Batavia inheritance will cost her more in lawyers' fees than it will bring her.
What a mess.
Caroline. " Happiness...
Fritz...
Love...
There is something, I can feel it.
I cannot endure gathering clouds.
Between us there must be blue skies."
"Dear Caroline, I'm happy about Charlotte, but I long to see, speak and laugh with you again soon.
Mohammedans face Mecca when they pray.
I will buy a new desk so I can face Rudolstadt, seat of my faith and prophet.
But as far as next summer is concerned, should I go to Jena as a professor, I will lose all control of my time."
"Then I will come to you.
God willing, to both of you, and I'll throw myself in your arms."
"You never wrote back, Line. Do you think Schiller will be acceptable to Maman?
It is clear now that he'll go to Jena.
He wrote to you about it. Will this little financial security make him eligible to Maman?
No one knows of our engagement, is that right?
Answer me.
Dearest, answer me." "I can't tell Maman now. Her eye complaint is getting worse.
Despite the autumn sun, her blinds remain shut.
And with Knebel away, she's upset. I can't ask her now.
I fear I'm pregnant by Beulwitz.
It's driving me insane."
The first time Schiller passed by my window.
- When the trees were still green.
And from behind you could see how shabby his coat was.
- Since when?
When you were in Kochberg and I went back ahead of you, we met in the salon and pledged our love.
I will marry him.
My God.
This beggar of a man and you. You don't want it kept a secret anymore?
Then why tell me about it?
When you go home now, will you see him there?
Will he come? No. I'll see him in Jena when he introduces himself.
I see.
He's finally getting the professorship.
So when will he ask Dear Mother for your hand in marriage?
My sister was supposed to prepare the way, but...
But apparently the whole thing is somewhat up in the air, right?
And your sister seems a little changeable. You spoke of her mood swings.
I love my sister. I admire...
And Monsieur?
Schiller himself?
I think you're right, Lollo.
No more secrets.
Or he'll leave you in the lurch, this Schiller.
Great minds drain one's soul.
That's what Maman says, but what's the meaning of love? The meaning of love? For an artist?
A male mistress?
As far as I know, there are other ladies in town who lay claim to Schiller and will make this claim in public.
Shall I cut them off?
- Don't hurt yourself. I can't stand it.
All these years. No one can take away our years together. It's a treasure we can draw on.
Fritz!
Why didn't you tell me you got engaged so I'd have known before all the others?
- It's humiliating. - It was a secret. A secret?
- Is that a joke?
Go on humiliating me, in whatever way.
I'll pay you a life annuity for it.
My husband will forget about his little jealousies and ﬂatteries.
All our years together. It mustn't be finished!
First in Mannheim, now here.
You came here for me, remember that.
I came here after I'd been exiled because I didn't know where to go.
This is no good. Your marriage, my dependence, it can't go on.
It can!
Stay with me for another year.
I'll make that promise. You'll be free and get my inheritance.
You can't be serious. We'll put it in writing.
Only remember what the poet says,
"I'm a human being too,' says the dust.
'I'm a spirit too,' says the universe."
He visits houses of ill repute. He takes other people's money without giving thanks.
He wears the clothes of his lover's husband outdoors and pawns them off.
I'm not saying he steals them.
Next to his genius that can move the soul, and next to his vulnerability there is a fundamental wantonness about him that should repel one."
There's a terrible draft here.
No, I can't come up to your room. That would be compromising.
I've received a letter.
He is unfaithful. He visits houses of ill repute. He takes other people's money without giving thanks.
He wears the clothes of his lover's husband.
I'm not saying he steals them.
Next to his genius that can move the soul, and next to his vulnerability there is a fundamental wantonness about him that should repel one."
Did you write this?
Your intuition and knowledge of my style of writing should tell you I didn't. "Wantonness" is a word I wouldn't use. I'd have to call myself that.
Anyway, during our affair, I violated every possible moral norm, emotional and physical.
So it's idiotic to put moral judgments like "wantonness" into my mouth. But I must admit that the writer contrived this affair against me well.
You want to believe I wrote the letter so you can break off our friendship.
You have to believe it to be able to reorganize your life.
I want you to take your letters back.
And I know whom I must thank for my professorship in Jena.
You overestimate my influence.
Many others were involved.
Dalberg, the governor of Erfurt and Mainz.
You know him from the past. But also the Privy Councillor himself, whom you impressed in Rudolstadt, and last but not least, the Duke.
Your good deed seals my final step towards an independent life as an academic and author.
"Line, I was shocked at myself.
How well I could perform such a base drama.
I keep thinking I did it for you too.
I feel dirty.
I will tell you everything."
And I'm not pregnant, thank God.
Welcome.
"So after all the conversations and meetings here in Jena,
I can say no more and no less than that I will assume my professorship in history proudly and humbly next year.
My first lecture has been going through my mind since 11 o'clock this morning.
And I keep thinking about our evening at the Lengefeld house when you said, seeing the twilight, 'The Swedes are coming.'"
I said that.
No, you're right, you said it.
- What are you grinning at?
- I was grinning?
- You've been grinning all day. - Forgive me, I will stop at once.
"Give my best regards to your dearest mother.
I imagine her sitting in the salon wearing dark glasses that protect her from the winter light, listening to you reading the letter.
And when she hears this, I would ask her to nod her head just once.
She'll know why and what she's giving her blessing to, am I right?
Then everything will be all right, my Wisdom Lollo."
Johann Christoph Friedrich Schiller, do you take Charlotte Luise Antoinette von Lengefeld to be your wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward until death do you part?
Then answer, "I do, so help me God."
I do. So help me God.
Charlotte Luise Antoinette von Lengefeld, do you take Johann Christoph Friedrich Schiller to be your wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward until death do you part?
I do.
I do. So help me God.
What God has joined together, let not man separate.
In as much as Johann Christoph Friedrich Schiller and Charlotte Luise Antoinette von Lengefeld have consented to live forever together in wedlock and have witnessed the same before this company,
I pronounce that they are husband and wife.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
SPRING 1789, JENA
Do the middle part again.
- How much sleep last night?
- Five hours.
- That's too little.
- But deep.
That's true. I could barely wake him. A typical symptom:
a deep sleep before dawn.
Open your mouth. Stick your tongue out.
You're not yet fit, man.
- I can't remember ever having been fit.
- Breathe in and out again.
So have it changed.
Pull your trousers down.
Cough.
Let's go in here. Are you coming?
- Not back there?
- Come on.
- No ladies under 50 years of age.
- You wish.
The ladies do realize that women are banned from all university buildings? What?
Do you want to introduce that here too?
This is a reputable guesthouse. Only married couples may live here.
- The man's naked. - I am.
Be warned: we are thoroughly prepared for the ban on women during the lecture.
Schiller, did you know you were declared dead last week in a Berlin paper?
Here.
That's what made him fit again. "Jena.
The darling of all German Muses, Privy Councillor Schiller, died here."
I was a little piqued.
The doctor went to so much trouble.
Thank you.
Thank you for saving our master.
Dear Sister-in-law, as a result a Danish poets' society wants to grant me a yearly annuity.
The letter's on the table. - An annuity?
How much?
- Can't remember.
But it's all that matters.
Now please leave us alone. You go ahead.
There's an hour left. Yes, go on.
I won't ﬂee, I promise.
- Go sit at the front.
- Get well soon, all right?
Come on.
I escaped from Beulwitz.
He wanted to lock me in the tower in Rudolstadt, but I escaped at the last moment.
My compliments.
What are you looking for?
Schiller's inaugural lecture, "What is universal history and why study it?" It's been relocated.
Second ﬂoor.
There's another lecture hall.
What is universal history and why study it?
It is a joy and an honor to explore a field with you that offers the thinking observer many educational topics, the active man of the world wonderful examples, the philosopher important concepts, and everyone rich sources of the noblest pleasures.
The entire field of general history and the sight of so many splendid young men whose noble thirst for knowledge assembled them here, while in their midst many a genius for the coming era is present, make my duty a pleasure. Hear, hear!
It is a great gift I bring you.
Is there a greater gift than the truth?
The field of history is fertile and extensive. Its sphere contains all of the moral world.
History speaks to man incessantly...
Generations of common people have greeted the dusk this way when it spread its beautiful red ribbon across the horizon.
"The Swedes are coming." An image of horror.
Like a furrow, the horror of history, in this case the Thirty Years' War, is seared into man's memory, dreams and language, wittingly and unwittingly.
But all preceding ages sought to bring about our more human age without knowing it or without achieving it.
Ours are the treasures that mind and genius, reason and experience have finally brought forth after all this time. Only history will teach you to appreciate these values.
Habit and possession can easily rob us of our gratitude for them.
Precious values, stained with the blood of the best and noblest, that had to be won by the toil of so many generations.
However diverse the situations that await you in civil society, every act of service opens a path to immortality.
To true immortality, I mean, where the deed lives on, even if the name of its author stays behind.
Come on, put your hat back on, old man.
"A couple as happy as you two is a rare sight."
Thank you.
On 14 July 1789, 1,000 km away from Thuringia, in Paris, the Bastille was stormed.
Humankind's heritage, the desire for truth, morality and freedom that Schiller spoke about, began a new, heroic chapter this day.
But to do this, the old world order had to be executed first.
Up you go.
- Oh no, my hat!
Here's mine.
Thank you, men.
And tomorrow we'll tell him who spent the night with him.
What's wrong?
Each in his own way.
We live in the same quarters, but not as man and wife.
We live like sister and brother.
Why?
I could never have received the man you love so much.
You've done so much for Maman and me.
For you, I'd be willing to live my life in the shadows.
But don't you want him?
With you?
Why not, I thought you...
I'll follow you tomorrow evening by stagecoach.
Yes, you do that.
You're the best person in the world. But you must find your own way together.
I will no longer be in your way.
The cruel pact we made is null and void, Lollo.
I've been shortsighted, selfish and ignorant.
Forgive me if you can.
Love always, Caroline."
Line!
Come, I'll show you how a matrix is made.
While printing developments are being explained to him, in which the page layouts are fired in an oven, using plaster matrices that can then be stored, allowing countless copies to be made anytime...
The pamphlets that spurred on the Paris revolution. As the printer drones on,
Schiller hears her voice over the noise of the presses for a ﬂeeting moment, but initially thinks he's hallucinating.
Thousands and thousands of copies that inspired the revolution in Paris. It'd never have taken place but for the invention of the stereotype.
But when he actually sees her, his heart skips a beat. Herr Cotta has an instinct for it.
I'll take you to him. This is Herr Seeliger.
He was announced.
For the first time ever, he's glad he must stay incognito in Württemberg, due to the ban the Duke imposed years before, because no one must see his emotions at this moment.
How is it being home again? Familiar again after four weeks. It's good you're back.
Such wonderful cloth. Where is it from?
From my dear wife. Chinese silk, she says.
It's my incognito. She stitched F.S. inside.
- What's your wife's condition? - The heat bothers her. She's gone seven months.
She's fine, the doctor says. I trust him.
He delivered my younger sisters too.
We came to Ludwigsburg to see him.
I beg your pardon, Cotta, we just dropped in, we didn't know...
Who was that man? You're not serious?
He didn't recognize you either.
What you bring me is tremendous.
They all did as you asked and wrote articles for our journal.
Schlegel,
Fichte,
Humboldt,
Herder, Woltmann and Goethe.
I know, I'm really pleased too.
A great start to our journal "Die Horen".
It'll cause a sensation. Germany's future.
They all take part because they feel humanity's soul is being enslaved by the current uproar. Only the pursuit of beauty can free us.
There's no political discourse here, only aesthetics and history, art and philosophy.
Just the way it should be.
Forgive me for interrupting again.
Herr Dalberg, sorry for not recognizing you. Herr Schiller, you here? My dear Schiller.
- How long will you stay in Tübingen? - Just one night. I'm in haste, may I cut in?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
Cotta, I intend to let you have some of the pieces I've revised.
What are you reading?
Don't you recognize me, Line?
You don't make it easy, no greeting...
The Duke renewed my ban a year ago, as you know. The Duke is gravely ill.
I didn't know you were in Württemberg.
She doesn't know. Nor does Maman.
The Duke is so ill, he'll have forgotten the ban and what you look like.
I doubt that.
Don't take yourself so seriously. The world turns, even without you. Undoubtedly.
So we meet again:
me in exile and you returned home.
How's your husband?
He wants to get rid of me. No, I want to get rid of him. But I can't find anyone who'll have me.
We support each other.
He is grateful for my company.
For now.
What did you ask me?
- I asked you what you're reading. - "Clélie" by Madeleine de Scudéry.
- Do you know it?
I was never interested in courtly women's literature.
It contains a map of "The Kingdom of Love".
Along the river that ﬂows into the Sea of Dangers, there are villages.
"Longing", "Secret Message", "Indiscretion", "Treachery", "Loneliness".
There's also a "Lake of Indifference".
Beyond the Sea of Dangers lies the Unknown Country.
Madame de Scudéry was a noblewoman from Brittany who came to great fame in Paris 150 years ago.
She advocated a Kingdom of Love in which passion is forever subdued and where deep sympathies of the soul reign instead.
Just this once.
DIE HOREN, A MONTHLY JOURNAL
Karl Eugen, proud Duke of Württemberg, is dead.
What? The Duke is dead.
Charlotte.
Many thanks.
Now I no longer have to hide.
It's Schiller.
I've arrived home.
She says she's writing a novel.
She wants your help.
A novel. As if just anyone could write one. And she wants to publish it anonymously, so she doesn't believe in it herself.
It's just Madame von Beulwitz's way of emancipating herself from her husband.
She has great respect for the art of writing.
You once said she's talented yourself. That involved short stories. Pithy little observations.
A novel is something very different.
Still, I'd like to have her around me. She could help us so much.
Why not write to me directly if she wants to use me as midwife for her novel?
She just wants to hide from the chaos in her life. The planned divorce...
The almost public love affair with Dalberg in Mannheim.
- Her husband mustn't know.
- Or he won't agree to a divorce.
No, I'm not in favor of her coming here.
- How much higher?
- Fourth or fifth ﬂoor. - And who are you?
- What can I do?
Hurry up!
And breathe out, slowly. Lollo, you have to scream.
Yes, you have to scream. Scream or I'll pinch your cheeks.
Lollo, breathe, faster.
Breathe.
Can you see anything yet?
- Do come in. - How's it going?
What a wife you have there.
And what a sister she has.
Don't you want to put your son's birth announcement in the journal? Why not? Good idea.
On September 14th...
On September 14th, 1793, after four years of marriage, Charlotte and Friedrich had their first son,
Karl Friedrich Ludwig Schiller.
As Caroline promptly observed, that day, according to the new French calendar, was the 22nd day of the month Fructidor in the second year of the Republic.
- We have to hurry, dear man.
- The coach is mighty drafty, mind.
I have to make sure the leaﬂets get to Tübingen. You've given me the greatest day of my life.
I gave her some more money. The money is Dalberg's.
We stopped being a couple ages ago, but he refuses to agree to a divorce. He will.
Be patient.
You know what? You look like you've grown taller. He's so proud.
And he can be.
He's such a sweet boy.
Want some tea?
You really should ask your mother-in-law for some money.
Why? Her two daughters both live with you now.
You feed them, don't you?
I mean...
That one hangs around here all day.
Without doing any work. Mama, that's enough. What is this?
I'll tell you something,
Caroline's paid three thalers a week since she got here.
And where does she get that money?
Not from her husband, that's obvious.
Lunch is ready.
Requesting to be excused from household work for a few hours.
No, thank you. There's some tea left on the stove, Lollo.
- I'll heat up the stove.
- I did that two hours ago. Thanks.
He bit me.
Just like you always did.
Money, money, money.
Don't you start.
My student attendance in Jena has dropped recently from 400 to 30.
For every lecture I get five thalers less than before. The audience will fit in our quarters one day. Fritz, the baby's sleeping.
That was fast. Come in, eat some lunch. Have a seat.
I promised Wolzogen and Körner to write, within five years, two classical tragedies and half a dozen long poems, if you can find me a rich patron.
I'm fed up with begging.
Years later Caroline will remember how hot it was that November day when Schiller read the first draft of her novel.
Make the sentences shorter.
Look. This relative clause is redundant.
Why not put the foster-father's tale in direct speech?
From here. I'd have to put it all in direct speech.
No, don't use consistent concepts.
Do it differently every time. Literature can cope with inconsistencies.
And don't adopt this fateful female tone every time you want to generate tension.
In the scene by the fireplace the reader gets all the dark forebodings he needs to expect the next installment eagerly.
- Trust your talent. - You trust my talent, then I will too.
AGNES VON LILIEN ANONYMOUS
- Certainly.
"A big illuminated house showed me the way in the dark night.
It lay in solitude, surrounded by only few outbuildings.
'This is where you will see your mother,. Charles said to me."
Are you listening?
The mother.
"'We have nearly reached our destination..
The small door led to a long corridor sparingly lit by a single lamp.
Charles opened a side door and told me to go in."
"I entered a dark room. Charles locked the door behind me, ordering me to wait.
A few moments later a door opened opposite me, revealing a dim light, and a voice called out to me..."
"'Come in, my dear Agnes, your mother is expecting you impatiently."'
That's all for this month, my friends.
To be continued.
- No, no.
- Well, yes.
God, I'm aching for the next installments. I'm deeply moved.
What charming brazenness to stop there. It's like music taking you on its wings and carrying you away.
Must I wait another week for it to continue? No, a month, my son.
But how damned modern. I bet the author is a big name.
A really big name.
This play with destiny and the readers' hearts could be by you, n'est-ca pas?
Madame, I wish I had written it, but unfortunately...
Körner, maybe it's someone we both know and who is laughing up his sleeve. Perhaps.
Caroline, remember I told you,
"You will write glorious prose, Madame, and amaze all your male colleagues."
Why else sign it "Anonymous"?
May I open a window to relieve our collective breathing organs from this unbearable tension of suspense and concern?
I knew it!
The print run's been increased sixfold!
Keep the door to the stairs closed.
It's still going, but you have to put wood on it.
I'm so happy to be here.
I can write. He's helping me.
Let me stay a while longer. You can stay as long as you like.
Yes, Line. Do you have all you need?
Never mind. I know the way.
Put it on the ﬂoor, Mother. It doesn't matter.
Line, close the door.
It'll get cold in there.
Madame!
- I'm coming.
- Very good, Madame. - I'll see you down.
You're just there for safety.
Is Dalberg on his way from Mainz to Tübingen?
Is he waiting for you? Will you see each other tonight in the same hotel room with the lilies?
He's rented the room for your rendezvous. I made inquiries.
All of literate Germany is wondering who the author of "Agnes" could be, never suspecting Anonymous is in bed with theater director Dalberg.
You have no idea what it's like living in a marriage like mine.
You two are one heart and soul.
I'll write to your husband, he must see this can't go on. Fritz, we three are coming back together from great distances.
I missed you both desperately.
When I gave you both up in Jena, it tore out my heart, my life.
When my novel is finished, I'll be a free woman, a single woman.
We'll give a reception together, all three of us, in Weimar, all right?
And you will tell everyone who wrote "Agnes".
I could stand here for hours on end with you. Will it ever be like it was in Tübingen?
No, don't. Not here.
AGNES VON LILIEN, PART 5 ANONYMOUS
"Please release your wife, Caroline née Lengefeld."
Yes.
What?
"Please release your wife..."
"For the benefit of all concerned, exchange a notoriously elusive bed and table companion for one who is faithful, who is willing to bear the offspring you so desire."
Isn't that too direct, chère Maman? What do you say?
Has the writer gone mad? Is he in bed with my wife?
It is with certainty that I can...
Assure. Assure you that no one instructed Schiller to write this letter.
He speaks for himself. He only meant well.
But as usual he completely missed the target. He has the opposite effect on me, that much is certain.
"Dear child, Line, why can't you prevent your brother-in-law from helping you in your private affairs in such a clumsy manner?
Yours and Beulwitz's is a marriage of convenience, not some ridiculous, petty marriage for love that's over as soon as love's out the window.
"And I'm not happy about your ménage à trois in Ludwigsburg."
Your worried, loving Maman
Haven't we always said one sign is enough to consign our little mutual agreement to history?
But I do have one last request.
The shame Caroline feels penetrates her soul, but she considers it just punishment for betraying her sister in this very room.
""How generous of you,' said the Prince, 'to honor independence and the freedom of his assignment so much that you let him go.'"
That could be tighter.
It's about Agnes, right?
On the next page you manage just that.
"Bright as nature should our soul be in parting."
That's wonderful. You can find a better solution for this problem.
I don't know what you mean!
I like it the way it is.
What's wrong with, "Independence and the freedom of his assignment"?
I want it to stay like that.
No, you can do better, I know. "The free area of his action."
"The free circle of his action".
Who's that?
Who is that?
Well, I never!
Hey, young dad, protector of the herd, come into my arms.
- Where does the man come from? - Paris.
Five days of shaking and rattling, but I'll have bigger carriages designed.
They're already breeding bigger horses for you. Who knew he was coming?
- It was supposed to be a surprise. - That's what I call a surprise.
Look who's coming.
Look who's here. Well, who do we have here?
He just woke up. It's beyond words what's going on there. Massacre, murder...
These words don't begin to describe what's happening.
Guilty or innocent, everyone's sent to the guillotine, slit open alive in the middle of the street, kicked to death, ripped apart by horses like in the Middle Ages.
A mob rules, whose evil is so abysmal, whose lust for blood is more gruesome than anything humanity has ever seen.
Shouldn't we have known, Wilhelm?
Yes. Everyone.
Everyone who rang the bell for renewal should have known.
It's what I believe, having been there.
Nothing but baseness and hoping for the next blood frenzy.
The proceeds go to the murderers. This man's face was cut off.
He was guillotined back to front because he fought back.
Crude.
I don't want this. Didn't you once read to us about the Inquisition?
It's like that again. Some evenings I no longer wanted to live.
The little one has to sleep. I know, the ﬂoorboards in the kitchen creak.
May I sit on the bed?
I'm with child, Fritz.
I'm 4 or 5 months gone. I'm not sure.
I miss my period when I have cramps. Her condition should be kept secret.
Otherwise Beulwitz could annul the divorce. Is he willing then?
He wrote that he doesn't want to talk anymore.
He wants a divorce right away.
If he found out Line is pregnant and not by him, he could go back on his decision.
That's true, yes.
To him it was always about progeny.
Do you want to have the child?
Yes. Why?
Why not? She has...
Our dear doctor says I have a disposition to pneumonia.
My skin is as thin as a redhead's.
I don't want to die without having known the same happiness as you.
And where will you have the child? Here?
Are you hostile? No.
I know a village teacher near Schaffhausen. Herr Roll.
I'll write him. He might care for the baby until the divorce comes through.
But you're only in the fifth month.
The divorce will take at least a year, my lawyer says.
Until then Caroline shouldn't take any unnecessary risks.
There's too much at stake. A lot of money too, unfortunately. You won't travel alone.
I will travel with her.
I have no obligations here and I want to forget what happened in Paris.
- How much is Dalberg paying? - Dalberg?
He doesn't know. I broke up with him.
We had a pact, Line.
Was that too much of a fait accompli?
I'm no good at practical life. I even slept through my son's birth. Wilhelm's made of other stuff.
He's pragmatic, down-to-earth.
He's glad he can help a friend.
Yes.
What will become of our "Agnes"?
I'll start the new chapters myself in Switzerland and send you them.
Are you ﬂeeing?
I can't stay here. I sense she despises me. No, why?
I never told her we saw each other again in Tübingen.
Neither did I. She feels betrayed.
There is one question I will certainly not ask you.
Then don't.
If you're looking for gentleness, it's over there in that room.
- All I want is you. You're my life. - I'm not all you want.
I'm not good enough.
In Tübingen I was accosted in the middle of the street.
I have the smell of prostitution about me now.
I can't even remember whether Dalberg jilted me or I him. Which men have I been with these past months I can't remember.
- Don't hurt yourself.
- I have to, or I can't leave.
There's nothing honorable about feeling guilty, dirty and unhappy.
Trying to be happy is worth the effort.
I'll write the letter to the teacher.
You'll find it on the kitchen table in the morning.
Wake me up when you leave.
- You'll be back in six months, right? - In Weimar. When I'm free.
'Mary and Joseph looking for a stable.
"Wilhelm, I'm writing directly to you now.
Charlotte and I get the feeling we're calling your names into the cosmos.
Do you hear that?
I love him. I love him so much!
He belongs to me!
- "Are you well?"
Born August 16th,
1794.
"Roll wrote that the birth went well. Why don't I hear from you?
Have you lost Wolzogen?
Even In those Swiss mountain villages there are scribes who write letters for those who can't.
This should be enough for now.
"Caroline, damn it, where are you?
At least nothing's happened to her.
But what a melodrama!
Beulwitz, meanwhile, had agreed to a divorce.
The official records in Rudolstadt state as a reason:
"A ten-year marital incompatibility. " Caroline von Lengefeld receives no compensation from her first husband.
But upon informing the Schillers of her divorce, she also announces her imminent marriage to Wolzogen in Switzerland.
She writes, "Wilhelm has proven himself a loyal, loving companion.
He is the man and protector I have always looked for. Be happy for me."
It is striking that she makes no mention of her child.
The child that the Schiller's know was born and taken in by teacher Roll.
From this day on Schiller will call Caroline, "The woman who can't say yes".
One year later Adolf s date of birth is changed to 1795 in the Schaffhausen register.
Probably to hide the fact that Caroline's son was born illegitimate.
This dress has to be packed too.
If I should die in Weimar, I want to be laid out in that dress. Very well, Madame.
I shall put it all in writing, Schwenke, so you don't have to argue with my daughters over any details, if it comes to the worst.
Very well.
I want to be surrounded by my ten favorite books.
- The Voltaire. - Voltaire.
And the edition of my husband's writings.
Yes. And the New Testament and...
Madame?
I'd like to leave this set to Charlotte.
Wrap it up carefully in rags, clean the two silver jugs that go with it and put it all on the balcony.
Schwenke, the letter.
Don't cry, Schwenke, or you'll have to write it again.
"My dear children,
I'm writing the same letter to you both to prevent future disagreements."
LATE SPRING 1802
"My doctor informed me I have only a short time to live, owing to an incurable kidney ailment that he diagnosed with absolute certainty.
So he urged me to put all my worldly affairs in order while I am still able. Besides all things financial and material,
I want to clear up our relationships, especially yours.
In two days' time I'll travel to Weimar..." - The tableware. - Calm, boy.
"...and I wish to see you two, Charlotte and Caroline, there together."
Come on, little Caroline.
Good night.
It's remarkable how rarely one meets in Weimar while living only 500 paces apart.
Yes, Weimar is a labyrinth, as Fritz can tell you.
Ernst, come here.
What do you think of my beard?
Privy Councillor Goethe asks if your mother-in-law has arrived in good health.
- What should I tell him? - The truth.
How can I carry on reading like this? Karl, this is a story about you two.
Your father wrote a story about a Karl and an Ernst, two boys who were full of mischief.
I believe everything a genius does as a genius, he does unknowingly.
I bring a message for Privy Councillor Schiller and family.
So where were we?
Madame von Lengefeld's carriage got stuck in the mud halfway here.
Everyone is well, and hot drinks have been provided.
But they can't leave before tomorrow.
- They're staying in the coach?
- Yes. Maman was lucky.
- I'll ride out to them.
- No, stay here.
Let's write that letter to the privy councillor first.
We'll be back when Maman arrives.
We'll be home soon.
- Same time, same procedure.
Till tomorrow.
Why does she put that display cabinet in the entrance hall? Absurd. It's so petit bourgeois.
I notice that you still resemble no one but your mother.
Doesn't your father regret it?
He's fine the way he is.
- How old are you now, Adolf? - I am six, Chère Mère.
Really. You're tall for your age.
Do you remember your first four years in Switzerland, before your mother brought you here?
No.
Not even the great Rhine Falls?
Were you never there? Yes.
I do remember that, Chère Mere. Yes. I have memories of the Rhine Falls too.
They were always whispering in secret, your mother chattering all the time, while your aunt was always nodding.
Your grandfather...
Look, that's him on the wall over there.
He died young, and the girls really needed each other.
Your aunt used to ask me, "Are we poor now?"
And I said, "No, not yet.
When we only have one of our twelve 26-piece dinner sets left, yes, then we are poor."
Do you remember, my dear? You see?
And now I have brought you the last set I have.
Schwenke, show it to them. And now I am poor. But I don't need it anymore.
And the dear Lord will make me rich again soon enough.
Maman, dear. Yes. But I want you to drink from it together with your sister.
And that my dear son-in-law, Herr Schiller, whose steadily growing fame makes this old lady very, very happy, but also very ashamed of not having anticipated this fame at the time, when he first came to visit us in Rudolstadt that summer,
13 years ago.
I want you to stop quarreling!
We don't quarrel. You don't talk to each other.
You write polite cards and invitations, send back polite refusals, making sure you avoid each other on the street.
It must stop.
I don't want to leave this life feeling I've left a battlefield behind.
You've hurt yourself now.
- Why did you never ask?
- Ask you what?
It's my last tableware.
- What should I have asked?
- One question.
- Which one? - "Who is Adolf s father?" Why ask?
You didn't know yourself, with all your affairs at the time.
Dalberg...
- But I do know. - No, you don't.
- Yes, I do know!
- No, you don't!
Yes, I do.
- Don't you want to know too? - No! - Why not?
- It's none of my concern.
But what if it is?
I don't want to know!
- It's none of my concern! - Why doesn't anyone do anything? Yes, good, clever Charlotte has to cover her ears now.
You begrudged me this baby. Your face, when we spoke about this in Ludwigsburg,
I'll never forget it, never!
And now?
You've won. You've got him all to yourself.
How can you burden such a man with your vulgar little ideas of love?
How could you be so stupid and ignore reality?
You walked out on my husband every time things got serious!
You threw yourself at him and then you ran off.
We swore an oath to share everything.
What was I to share with you? The night you spent together in Tübingen?
The men you keep on a leash like a dog?
You lead the love life of a bankrupt feudal mistress.
In France you'd be put to the guillotine.
Right, because there they buried freedom instead of having it rule like they promised.
They were too small for real freedom.
They didn't mean freedom in bed.
Look at your husband. So sad.
This strong, confident man remaining silent while you live it up.
Ladies, ladies, we all like to witness your passion.
A doctor!
Someone get a doctor!
Lollo!
- This attack seems worse than ever.
- It was always like this.
Not like this.
- I get scared when the snow melts.
Let me help.
Schwenke, take out the bowl, please.
I'll stay here today. We'll have to wait through the night.
Come on, I'll show you your bed.
I'll manage.
I'll sleep in the other room. Let them talk and move about and rattle around. I like the sound of it.
The women in the von Lengefeld family all have a curious talent. Choosing men who lead the way to eternal life.
They'll end up together, all three of them widows. And together they will lovingly remember their late husbands.
Maybe that really is what keeps them together.
Something they themselves don't understand. Because, despite everything, it seems natural to them.
It's this trinity Schiller's always been looking for.
Their women's community, which they allowed him to enter, back in the summer of 1788.
Then they sent him not to paradise but to the solitary confinement of marriage.
Now, at this very moment, in the face of his deadly illness, they understand once again,
that he is a refugee on a cold and barren planet, a stranger to this world, and lonely.
He never searched for a home, but found one among them.
Line.
Lotte.
Friedrich von Schiller recovers from this bout of illness as so often before.
It isn't until three years later that his weakened body surrenders, and he dies in May 1805, only 45 years old.
In old age Caroline von Wolzogen writes her lifelong friend's biography.
The new printing techniques have long since triumphed and editions were published in numbers even Schiller couldn't have dreamt of.
Maybe the vast readership's expectations made Caroline fear indiscretion, for she withholds any Kind of intimate detail about her life in the biography. And shortly before her death she destroys all written evidence of the past.
Knowing that posterity will never be able to learn what really happened between the three of them must have been a comfort to her.
Against her will, however, one single note was preserved, the one she received in Rudolstadt in the summer of 1788.
"Last night, or rather this morning, things were beyond my control, and this evening I may be invited to a late dinner by Rengmann, the doctor who's been treating me here, but later on I will try to steal away to you."
As I explained on the phone, our coffins are made in France.
Solid wood, timeless models and handcrafted finishes.
As for the type of wood, we have oak, beech and mahogany.
Our selection is available in 0.7 or 0.85 inch width.
It's important because your father wanted to be cremated.
The wood you use doesn't justify your prices.
Your stuff is all recycled.
Ash.
Ash would be nice.
They don't have ash. Even the oak is Class D.
Look at the knots.
If that's prime cut, I'll be damned.
You're right, it's Class D.
This is disgusting.
Dad would roll over in his grave.

The guy wanted to enlist me. They must be hard up.
- What did you get?
- A blow-up mattress.
I whipped his ass.
He's 12 years old.
No way, he's at least 14.
Arnaud Labrède!
Oh yeah, we signed you up.
You're kidding me.
Labrède?
He's not here?
I'm not fighting a girl.
No one's fighting anyone. This is self-defense.
Hitting is off-limits so there's nothing to be afraid of.
I'm not afraid...
Come on, dude.
Shake hands.
Come on, fight back!
Fight back, it's not over.
What a humiliation, bro!
Bravo, young man.
You okay?
Don't forget your brochure, miss.
You almost ate it.
- Did you bite her or what?
- No. I did an armlock.
If that's what girls are like this year, long live France!
Arnaud?
The door is locked.
I'm taking a bath. What do you want?
It's not easy to talk through a door!
We'll talk later, Mom.
Does the breeze bother you?
I thought you were spending summer vacation with Xavier and Victor.
But Manu says you're staying here to work.
Were you planning on telling me?
Of course I was.
I thought I'd help out and start learning the trade.
In the current context, it's a serious commitment.
Do you understand?
You think I'm not committed enough?
What I mean is that you're free to look elsewhere.
Contact other companies or whatever.
The important thing is to plan ahead.
I don't want to plan ahead, I want to work here.
You see?
He shouldn't leave now anyhow.
Our new catalogue.
We might not be a big company, but with some good PR orders will pour in this summer.
Right, Arnaud?
Cool.
Our garden shelters are all unique.
For your home, I would suggest either the Rochelais or the Panama.
The photos give you a rough idea.
We adapt the structure to your home, your desires and your needs.
The important thing is overall harmony.
Madeleine?
Could you come here a second?
Sweetheart, which one do you like best?
You don't have to buy one.
They're used to rejection.
- Madeleine!
- It's true.
If you want to buy something useless, don't ask me.
Our products are factory-made and guaranteed for 5 years.
Cut the salesman crap.
You'd never say: "Our sheds are shit and they fall apart! â€œ
Even if they were of gold, they're dumb.
Are you a landscaping expert?
Tell us which one you like best, not your life story!
Drop it, Arnaud.
What about that one?
That's the one I like best.
We'll let you think it over.
Maybe it wasn't against you.
Maybe she doesn't like wood.
She did it on purpose. She made me look like a total moron.
Who gives a shit?
You sold your hut, end of story.
Your thing is beeping.
Shit.
It's fucking infested here.
Catfish eat up all the diversity.
Soon there'll be nothing else left.
Son-of-a-bitch catfish.
Want some help?
You want some help?
I didn't bust it.
Of course you didn't bust it.
It's like if I did this.
You have to visualize your target as if it were 12 inches behind itself.
You get it?
No.
You have to strike beyond your target.
Beyond your target.
You get it now?
I can't be here and out there hustling for clients.
Put it down here.
So I thought that... I'd let you do it yourself.
I'm going to work alone?
It'll be a good experience.
If word gets around, we'll be overrun with orders.
It's no big deal, you know.
It's like Lego building blocks.
We'll probably need to hire on.
The sky's the limit.
What's she doing with my roof tiles?
She's really nuts.
Yeah, she's kind of weird.
Totally off the hook is more like it.
Good luck, bro.
Do you have a vegetable garden?
For the earthworms.
Are you spying on me?
You swim weird.
It's not weird, it's the combat swim.
- What?
- Combat swim. Drop it.
I'm sorry I bit you the other day.
If there's anything I can do to make up, just let me know.
Goddammit!
Are you trying to drown it?
Make yourself at home.
What do you want me to do?
You can adopt it.
Ferrets are easy to tame.
That's a ferret?
A baby ferret.
He'll love you like a mom.
Like a mom?
Animals don't have emotions. If you die, your cat will eat your face after 3 days.
We'll turn him loose.
He's too little.
He stinks of chlorine, his mother would reject him.
He'd die instantly in nature.
I can't keep it. I'm joining the army in September.
Permanently?
Then I'll keep it.
We're so crashing the party.
No, it's not. No one told us not to come.
Excuse me, you know a babe named Violet?
No?
Thanks anyhow.
Saskatoon, in Saskatchewan.
What cartoon?
Saskatoon.
I thought you were going to Canada.
That is Canada.
Why the hell are you going there?
It's better than here.
I'm rotting away here. France is dead.
Get real.
There's no future here.
So you're not coming back?
Depends what happens.
At least I'll learn English.
You don't have to go that far. There must be shitholes in England too.
He's right. The idea isn't to stay close.
- What is the idea?
- Yeah, what is the idea?
I'll be right back.
Victor doesn't give a shit about us.
We take an interest in his stuff and he just walks off.
The two of us by the BBQ...
This is a preview of what it'll be like when he splits.
Oh yeah?
It'll be just the two of us. But we'll stick together.
Did you know... that your cat will eat your face after 3 days?
Here we go.
This will fall apart in ten years' time.
This is what we need.
You don't give a shit?
Can we get this?
What for?
To make a cage for the ferret.
- Your name, please?
- Labrède.
L-A-B-R-E-D-E.
I have a Mr. Eric Labrède registered for the same company.
That's not us. It was our father.
You want me to transfer his loyalty points to your account?
What should I do?
What do you say?
What do I do?
How should I know?
Arnaud?
I don't know. Take them.
They'll be lost otherwise.
Okay. It'll pay for your netting.
- We'll take them.
- Okay.
Hey.
How's it going?
Things coming along?
Yeah.
I've almost finished the frame.
You know, pillars like these can support a very large amount of weight.
Great.
You know where the soldiers are?
The truck over at the lake is gone.
I know, they left.
They've moved on to the next town.
Never mind.
You want me to take you?
I'll get a helmet.
Fuck!
Don't get all mad.
I want to sign up.
We're closed. Come back tomorrow.
For starters, take your helmets off.
Arnaud!
I didn't recognize you.
Well?
Has it sunk in yet?
Let's say that, now I can see... better beyond stuff.
Can't you help her? It's important.
This is fucked.
Army Preparation Camp 1st Parachute Dragoon Regiment
Are you enlisting or going to summer camp?
For the regiment I want to join, you have to take a preparation course.
You have to take a course to join the army?
I thought you just showed up.
It depends on the regiment.
The one I want is super hard.
Super hard, like what?
Super hard, like you sweat your guts out.
If you want to sleep, you dig a hole.
There's physical combat.
You have to swim with 60 lbs. on your back.
You ever swim with Rangers?
No.
There's an entrance exam.
You have to eat a raw sardine.
First the head, then the eyes, entrails and scales.
That's what you want to do?
They have the best survival techniques.
After that, I'll be prepared.
Prepared for what?
To survive.
I got that. But survive what?
How do you know the recruiter?
Maybe I'm interested too.
Oh yeah?
We talked one day.
He showed me some technical stuff.
Like what?
Stuff.
Stop playing Mr. Mystery Man.
You ever heard of "double visualization"?
You're going to hit my shoulder.
You need to double visualize my shoulder 12 inches behind itself.
In other words, as if there were another me behind me...
You visualize him but you hit...
I think I double visualized you well.
You dislocated my shoulder.
Your turn.
I don't hit girls.
Oh yeah, I forgot. You bite them.
I think it's raining less.
Sort of.
Can you explain this shit?
Where were you?
Answer me!
Where were you?
You fucked up!
For once I give you some responsibility!
I'm Madeleine Beaulieu.
Your sons are working at my place.
Oh, yes. Good evening.
I brought you a present to make up for the storm and all.
That's very sweet. Thank you.
Should I take it?
It's baby chicks for the ferret.
- Baby chicks?
- Don't worry, they're dead.
They're frozen. It's more practical.
I got them at a chicken breeding farm.
They sell their losses to dry dogfood companies.
Powdered baby milk isn't good for ferrets. They eat meat.
They need solids, otherwise you change their nature.
That's what dogfood does.
I don't know what to say. Thank you.
It's sweet of you.
Will you stay for dinner?
No, I just came to give you the present.
I insist. It would make me very happy.
I'll put this in the fridge.
The freezer.
Hey.
Can you imagine a fire in here?
Your mom invited me for dinner.
You don't mind?
No.
You put him in here?
Not bad.
You make coffins too?
No, that was for my dad.
They were all ugly so we said we'd make our own.
But you need a special license.
We didn't have enough time.
Now we don't know what to do with it.
It's not bothering anyone.
No.
Are you in college?
I have a Master's in economic modeling.
And what's that for?
The idea is to anticipate future events in order to adapt to them now.
But since future events won't exist, it's pointless.
I dropped out this year.
I can understand.
Years of college with no job guarantee...
The recession, unemployment...
It's not easy.
There's far worse in store than unemployment.
But since we only focus on trivia, we don't see it coming.
What don't we see coming?
The end. The end of what?
"The end. " Our extinction.
Oh, I see.
What should we look out for?
Take your pick.
Hunger strikes, religious wars, drought, global warming, inversion of the poles, nuclear plants blowing up...
Or epidemics.
That respiratory thing you can't cure.
Coronavirus?
Its prevalence is dropping so...
We watch TV too.
And you like this idea?
Not particularly.
But we're responsible for it all.
Me, in my backyard, I'm responsible for your end of the world?
What are EU forest industry subsidies?
67.
67%.
For nothing. We create imbalances everywhere.
And you left college to deal with this?
Makes sense.
I wanted time to prepare.
So what should we do?
Dig holes and bury our provisions like the Mormons?
- In your opinion?
- You're the expert.
How long will the Mormons hold out?
Three months?
- More. - Six months?
They'll hold out for one year.
That's a lot of food.
Lots of canned beans.
And what happens after one year?
I'm asking you.
You're back where you started.
You haven't solved the problem.
Your Mormons will croak.
They'll all kick the bucket.
- Do you think I'm crazy? - Not at all.
We'll see who's crazy in ten years' time.
I think it's depressing.
And you, Arnaud?
What?
What do you think?
I don't know.
Kids do feel insecure nowadays.
It's a recession.
Not that.
Her end-of-the-world thing.
If you look around, things are pretty dismal.
This is cheerful.
The chicken is delicious.
Here.
You should start off with less weight. Like they say on the website:
I was wondering, are you busy tonight?
I'm going out with the guys and if you wanted to come...
What for?
I don't know. But since you're leaving for camp on Monday...
Whatever.
Okay, cool.
- You don't want your lemon?
- It's all yours.
- And the mint leaves?
- Go for it.
Where's Xavier?
You want to dance?
The poor things don't even know why they're here.
They're having fun.
They're dancing and enjoying themselves.
Yeah, sure.
Crowding around under three spotlights is totally retarded.
They're having fun!
Oh really?
Hey, are you having fun?
You having fun?
There you go. Everyone's fucking bored.
At least they're making an effort.
They have a little respect.
Respect?
Yeah, respect tor the club. For other people.
You could've made an effort too.
You could've worn a skirt or put your hair up.
I bet you look good in skirts.
What?
I tried to imagine you out there dancing in a skirt.
Fuck you too!
- I can be a dance floor slut too.
- Go ahead.
Shit, dude, I'm fucking horny. A beer?
- How do you do that?
- What?
By hurting myself.
You want to try?
Hold it tight. Bite down.
Pull it back.
Is that your hardest?
Is that your hardest?
You asshole, that hurt.
Knock it off, you're giving me a headache.
You're not coming?
No, I'm going home.
Bye.
This feels so fucking good!
Just like yo mama!
His girlfriend's not coming in?
I wanted to see her naked!
"Army. "
"Army. "
Hello.
I was wondering whether it's still possible to sign up for your training camp?
The 1st Parachute Dragoon Regiment.
Remember the army truck at the lake?
Throw me the strap.
They're offering a free 2 - week training course.
The army is hard up. It's the No. 1 recruiter in France.
Number 2.
The first is McDonald's.
I thought about it.
I enrolled.
I won't be able to work with you over the summer.
You're joking, right?
It's only training camp. I didn't enlist.
I don't get it. You got a sudden urge to join the army?
They have over 400 professions.
There's lots of opportunities for guys like me.
You can get your driver's license and they even have carpentry.
I don't give a shit if they teach you how to do macramé.
Two worksites start next week and this one's late.
It's cool. We're almost done.
No, it's not cool!
How am I supposed to manage alone?
I'm busting my ass to save the company.
I smoke twice as much as Mom!
And you decide to walk out on me?
Are you crazy?
You don't give a shit or what?
Is it because I said you should plan ahead?
IS that it?
I'll be back in two weeks, Mom.
You'll keep your hair, won't you?
Surprise.
What are you doing here?
I'm doing the course, like you.
The recruiter called me back. He said I should grab the opportunity.
Did you see that?
It happens all the time in the summer.
We're stopping at every hole in France.
I swear to God.
No one's even getting on.
Yes, there is.
P.D.R.?
Yeah.
Is this your first camp?
Not you?
It's my third.
- Did you learn anything useful?
- Yeah.
You learn a lot about yourself and group management.
Anything technical?
Technical?
With the mountain infantry, we learned to pee on ourselves in avalanches.
What for?
To find the slope.
Otherwise you don't know.
The way the liquid flows shows you which way to dig.
That's cool. I wouldn't have thought of it.
It's a great adventure.
Good evening.
I'm Lieutenant Schliefer.
Welcome to the 1st PDR.
As I'm sure you already know, a fire has broken out in the region.
The regiment was mobilized to evacuate residential zones.
That's a soldier's duty too!
I'll get straight to the point.
Your rooms aren't ready. You'll sleep in the gymnasium.
Are there any non-males amongst you?
I'll ask again.
We have no co-ed dormitories.
Are there any girls here?
Yes.
Step forward, young ladies.
I want no problems... with sex... because of you.
Is that clear?
Very well.
You over there. Take your cap off!
- Officer Ruiz, take over.
- Thank you, sir.
Okay. Men, you head over to the gym.
Follow me, ladies. I'll show you your rooms.
Give it to me. I'll show you.
They fit together along the grooves.
Okay.
Last year, we did it in the dark.
Now I can do it eyes closed.
Cool.
One, you fit it in. And two.
Here.
- What field do you want to work in?
I'd like to work in telecommunications.
Radio frequencies and technical stuff.
I want to fight.
Oh yeah?
What about you?
I didn't imagine beds like this.
What did you expect?
I thought they'd be old and rotten.
At least they're ugly and they squeak.
- Lights off?
- It's only ten o'clock.
You've got muscle tone. What do you do?
Macroeconomics.
Good night.
Here.
How's it going?
Lift your arm, index finger facing the horizon.
It's a little trick. It's not super precise, but it's better than nothing.
How far is the corn field?
You said to multiply by what?
115 feet.
It's okay.
What do we do now?
Nothing.
We go home.
One last example.
This time it's a critical situation. You need to make a fast decision.
Come on.
- Create a diversion.
- Not bad.
Forget about diversions. You charge.
"Operation Last Chance. " Like Call of Duty.
No!
You have your pals with you.
Your comrades. So no Kamikaze moves.
You there. What would you do?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Clear out?
Sounds like a good idea.
You disperse.
Now that's interesting.
That's interesting. You do not run!
You re-de-ploy.
We're listening. What next?
That's all.
Each man for himself.
I wasn't thinking of that.
Trainee Peretti.
- We change the rules of the game.
- Why?
- To get the upper hand, sir.
- That's it!
Get the upper hand!
What he just said is very important.
Get the upper hand!
It's the heart of our doctrine.
If you learn one thing here, make sure it's that.
Get the upper hand.
15-minute cigarette break.
Excuse me, sir.
How do you concretely get the upper hand?
Technically speaking.
Did anyone else not understand?
15-minute break.
Beaulieu, ask someone who was listening.
Imagine that a grenade lands here in the middle of us.
We're all dead.
But to prevent that from happening, it only takes one person.
If he covers the grenade with his body, he absorbs the blast. The others are saved and can fight back.
Demonstration.
Good show. We're all dead.
Well done. Bravo.
You're sure it's a fake?
Yes.
Good show, Peretti!
We talked about team spirit. That can mean sacrifice.
Another problem, Beaulieu?
Yes.
In real life no one would ever do that. It's against our basic instincts.
We're not here to let instincts rule. Here we learn about duty.
It's unenforceable, sir.
End of discussion.
Now for first aid.
Who has training?
Good.
The others will do the course while Labrède cleans the latrines.
That first-aid class was intense.
Beaulieu broke three of the mannequin's ribs.
You on a diet?
Rustic simplicity my ass!
Is this the paratroopers?
Can you believe it?
You don't want your Jello?
Here.
If you want, I can show you how to do the massage.
You know, the first-aid cardiac massage.
You want to show me how to fold my panties too?
She's hardcore.
What's on the schedule tomorrow?
Swimming with Schliefer.
Beaulieu.
Listen to me carefully. Because I won't repeat it.
I'm the one grading you.
You impress no one with your big mouth and your degrees.
If you want to be a commando, you'd better shape up.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Good show, men.
Good.
Nice reflex.
I wouldn't have done it.
Come on, push hard.
Come on.
Don't push off the wall.
No, I'm good.
Move aside!
That's good. The strong help the weak.
Your turn, Labrède.
That was good.
Good, Labrède.
Come on, Beaulieu.
Yes!
Come on, Beaulieu!
That's it!
Push!
You're almost there!
Man down!
Get him out!
Reds!
Man down!
What are you talking about?
What's going on?
Nothing. I wasn't hit.
Look at your bag.
What about it?
My bag was hit?
If you're hit, you're eliminated.
Hang on. What's inside my bag?
My vital organs?
My arteries?
Bags?
No one said nothing about our bags.
We're not going to argue.
You're dead.
So you should shut up.
Stop showing off. Bullets pierce a bag, so lie down!
What's the deal?
You think you're a ballistics expert?
- Stop the bullshit.
You were hit.
- I was not!
Then take it off. Show us your back.
Dream on. Suck off your pal.
I think we should all return to our initial positions.
Are you her pet dog or what?
I feel sorry for you. Go lie down.
And you, Beaulieu, stop...
How are you?
What happened?
I got a warning.
It'll stay on my record.
Shit.
All because of that prick.
Go on, hold your nose.
The mountain infantry taught him to piss and he thinks he's hot.
But a little headbutt sends him running.
I hate guys like that!
Why is he here, to kiss ass?
Chill, Madeleine.
Want to try the makeup workshop?
Okay.
The idea is to... break up the shape of the face.
You apply it with two fingers... in diagonal streaks.
You want to conceal... the patterns of your nose... your mouth... and your eyes.
That way, everything disappears.
- It burns. - That's normal.
Don't touch.
Look.
Very good.
Now it's my turn.
What's that?
Nothing.
They made me unit leader for the orienteering race.
Close your eyes.
Everyone smile!
The first unit to attain the objective will have the honor of raising the regiment's flag on Saturday.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Good luck, Labrède.
Get the upper hand.
Leduc, are we good?
Yeah, it's over there.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Charlie, Romeo speaking.
State your coordinates.
Lieutenant Schliefer?
I can't hear you, Lieutenant.
There is no Lieutenant Schliefer!
This is Romeo. Over.
Madeleine, stop it.
Charlie, Romeo speaking. State your coordinates.
Where are we, Jordan?
We're either here... or here.
But I'd say we're heading... that way.
That's east. The target is due south.
Jordan's having a hard time. I think we're totally lost.
Shut up, Camara.
"Lost" is not a coordinate.
The target isn't really south.
Yes, it is. Look, Jordan.
The hill slopes downwards.
That changes the direction.
Are you sure?
Give it here.
- Give the map back!
- One minute.
No, give it back right now!
Let me deal with it.
Listen to me.
What?
Doesn't he have the compass?
I'm sorry!
Okay?
You have the compass by the way!
Where are you going?
I have a life to go back to.
Good evening.
Would you like anything?
A beer, please.
We only have alcohol-free.
Maybe with the regional specialties?
An alcohol-free beer is fine.
Everything alright?
It's nothing.
Vigipirate security plan.
Would you like anything?
No.
You insinuating I don't have a life?
I'm not insinuating, I'm saying it:
You have no life.
You don't like people. You eat things that disgust you. When you do sports, you look like you want to die.
You fight to stay in the army but you hate it.
I'm sorry, life is the opposite of everything you do.
And building dumb wood huts is life?
It might be dumb but I like doing it.
- You don't like anything.
- It's not true.
- It's not true?
- No.
Tell me one thing you like.
I like lots of things.
For example...
For example, I like dogs.
Dogs?
Like that one?
Exactly.
Hey, doggie. Don't waste your breath.
Hey, puppy dog!
Come here, puppy.
You got some extra room?
If you want to go back with your loser friends, it's time.
Come on, let's go.
What now?
We'll survive. We'll adapt. That's what you wanted, right?
What do you have on you?
I have a knife. That's all.
I have a flashlight, mess kits and the camouflage tarpaulin.
We're totally underequipped. Great.
Wait, I have one combat ration left.
Lamb stew.
Toss it. We don't need their stuff.
Lamb stew...
They'll be no help when everything goes up in flames.
This is a perfect spot.
There's everything we need.
It's great.
What are you doing?
What're you doing?
I'm going to build a shelter.
What's so funny?
Nothing.
It's cool.
It's not finished yet.
I'll put some storage space here. There's a bookshelf in the back.
Great.
Not bad, huh?
I'll get some moss to insulate the roof.
Don't go that way. I laid traps.
Not that way either.
No?
You should probably go around.
This way?
What next?
Nothing. We just enjoy.
Can't we enjoy and do something?
We shouldn't expend calories.
Why don't you make a fishing line?
Do I have to wait long?
You have to wait.
What's the goal?
The goal is to bury them gently without breaking them.
What's the point?
Nothing.
You want to try?
What do you think about while you do it?
Nothing.
I can't do it.
Then you won't survive.
It you cant concentrate on a pine needle, you can't survive.
Knowing how to pass the time... not doing or thinking about anything in particular... that's surviving.
Otherwise you go crazy.
What's going on?
I'm passing the time.
Hang on, I'll wrap the wire around once more.
You think it'll hold?
Of course it will.
It's a real pro's trap.
Turn it the other way.
Wow, looks like France.
I'm hungry.
You're always hungry.
Did you hear something?
No, it was my stomach.
The wildlife here is starting to piss me off.
We still have those weird hazelnuts.
They have zero protein.
We should've taken more Snickers from the army.
Come on, eat!
Don't be fussy.
It's disgusting.
Shit, look at this.
I'm sure you can eat the bones. I bet it's full of good stuff.
I can't eat this.
Don't waste food!
I swear to God, this is horrible.
I'm done.
I'll stick to fishy hazelnuts.
You don't know what you're missing.
I think I'm lying on a rock.
Are we sleeping directly on the ground'?
No, not at all.
I made a one-inch mattress of lichen.
It's okay.
It's fine.
Want me to remove the rock?
No, don't worry. I'll curl up around it.
By the way... Why are you whispering?
I don't want to scare off the game.
Oh, I see.
Are you okay?
Don't look.
I'll stay over here, okay?
You're shaking. I'll get a jacket.
Madeleine!
Are you okay?
Open your eyes. Keep your eyes open!
Look at me!
Look at me!
She's upstairs. She hasn't woken up yet, but she's fine.
Thanks.
They can't get the fire under control. 900 hectares have already burnt.
The town they found you in burned down. Wiped off the map.
We were lucky.
How much is 900 hectares?
200,000 trees?
More like 2 million. You half asleep?
It's a big deal. It'll affect the price of wood.
We're okay, I stocked up before. You'll see.
If you want to, that is.
I'm not forcing you.
Can you imagine the waste?
All because some idiot tossed a cigarette.
People don't realize how fragile forests are.
Sometimes forest fires occur naturally.
The forest just bursts into flames.
- Where did you hear that?
- On TV.
When the forest reaches its maximum development... When there's really no more room, a fire breaks out.
Everything burns. Afterwards, the forest starts afresh.
Everything starts over.
But most of the time... it's some idiot who tosses a cigarette.
The other case is rare.
How's the tomato soup?
Wonderful.
You don't hurt anywhere?
Not at all.
Barely 3 on a scale of one to ten.
Did you have to rate your pain?
What did you say?
Four for the head. I had a headache.
Here?
It's funny... I'd never have thought of rating pain.
Higher up.
Three's not bad. It leaves room for improvement.
We can call it a day.
We'll recover slowly.
I'm already feeling better.
Oh yeah?
Of course, I was better trained.
Nice to hear, next time you'll carry me.
Next time... it's going to be different.
Next time, we need to be better prepared.
We will be.
We'll be ready.
That's right.
We won't be caught by surprise. We won't improvise.
We'll be on the look-out.
On the look-out.
On our guard.
What's this now?
Did you arrange this?
Who are they?
No more room in the campgrounds and there's a sick boy with them.
-He doesn't exactly look sick.
-He did up close.
Did you talk to these people dressed like that?
We'll never get rid of them.
-What are they doing?
-Got water.
-Why didn't you call us?
-I didn't want to disturb the afternoon nap.
-I was awake anyway, so I thought...
-Didn't you realize we're not free with strangers in our yard.
-They'll have to use the toilet.
-Ah, well.
Problem solved.
-Let's send them away.
-Well, that's a bit harsh.
...who'd recognize their best works as glaring sins?
Who have forfeited everything?
Who take the Lord for their refreshment?
There are still seats.
Are there still those who are far from the Lord?
Are any among you called?
Are there those among you who welcome death?
Because only after death true life awaits us.
Believe that the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ has been spilled to atone for our sins.
We've strayed from the path to salvation because we lack the strength to choose the narrow road. We don't have enough strength to remain on the narrow road until death when true life awaits us beside Him who we love above everything.
That we die to be able to be reborn.
Raise your heart to the Lord.
-Katelijne. -Hello, sir.
-I can't win with this skirt.
-Sure you can.
Amen.
So what were the points, guys?
Well?
The three points of God's sacred law.
The law curse the sinner. The law damn the sinner.
And...
The law kill the sinner.
-The tractor's fuel is almost gone again.
-Yes, it's a guzzler.
-I'll top it up tomorrow.
-I'll do it.
-Let Rogier do it.
-Rogier?
Dad, he was riding around like a maniac yesterday.
So what did you see me do?
-Zigzagging like a drunk.
-Nonsense.
Hey, hey.
-You're lucky that barn's still there.
-Do you learn that arguing in church?
-Name one thing you saw me do.
-That's enough.
my help comes only from the Lord
Who heaven, sea and earth created and preserved ever since
When I have money, I'm going to Canada.
Apparently, farms are much bigger over there.
Canada!
Katelijne!
Katelijne.
Stubborn as a mule.
Did you use this one down there?
That's my washcloth.
Luckily, I'm clean both down and up.
Yuck.
Satan, the killer of humans from the beginning of time will do his utmost to pull you off the straight and narrow.
Keep in mind, children, at your new schools you'll be exposed to his temptations. Yes?
-Satan wants us to read different books.
-Yes.
-About us descending from apes.
-Right.
-And fairy tales.
-Exactly.
Fairy tales are expressions of pagan stories.
Satan always looks for something that's dear to your heart.
Don't be too quick to think that music has no hold on you.
There's something in music that tempts you.
And now...
Satanic texts.
They discovered in America that the subconscious can decipher Satanic texts.
I will rise
I'm your sire Satan
There are also a lot of songs about sex, but I don't have an example of that right now.
God's word stands firm throughout eternity it will not budge an inch
Satan...
Look, this is a cow.
When the cow eats a dandelion it will first go down into the rumen.
Then into the reticulum, followed by the omasum. And lastly into the abomasum. It's over here.
And over there.
When the cow poops, the dandelion is still yellow.
Go and have a look when dad turns on the mixers.
They float all the way to the top.
Kat...
Ro, I'm warning you. A child doesn't belong in a café.
Straight back home after shopping.
It's not for us. Come on.
I was wearing my coveralls and my cap when I tripped on a ham.
A ham this big.
I thought: I'll carry it inside.
Look at all that ice-cream. Eat it before it melts.
And the coffee.
-With everything. I'm not a cheap date.
I cut a piece off that ham, tasted it and I grimaced.
Sea salt.
Then I knew it had been a pig with erysipeloid.
They hope that by cooking it in seawater you wouldn't find out about it.
Later on I heard that the reverend had gotten a piece first.
I assume that if it hadn't ended well for him salvation would still await him.
-Grandpa?
-Yes?
Is that story about the ham true?
Grandma thought the Lord had sent it.
Who knows?
You're filthy.
It's over.
The fumes.
What mischief did you get up to?
He was looking for dandelions.
What were you thinking?
You know how dangerous that manure pit is.
What will become of our body?
It returns to dust and the worms will eat it.
Who shall be called rich?
Those who have stored up a treasure in heaven.
Who want to leave the world?
Those who are heirs to the Lord.
Who are the happiest people?
Those who desire no greater happiness than doing the will of God.
Who are the unhappiest?
Those who follow their own will.
What will be their end?
Eternal damnation.
What will be the end of the pious?
Eternal salvation and glory.
Amen.
It's the tough, narrow road which leads to the Lord.
The broad road is more pleasant and easier. Which is why many of us take that road.
Unfortunately, I add.
And from his throne, the Lord will address them.
And to them he says:
I never knew you.
"Away from me."
Mur thoughts are with the wife and family of Mr. Minderhoud.
That's what happens... when you find your business more important than your salvation.
No sign or anything that he ended up well?
No one has seen or noticed anything.
Small is the gate and narrow the road to life and only a few find it.
-Are you ever troubled by your sins?
-Mh, that child.
She doesn't want to hear it, but even green leaves fall sometimes and then it's too late.
-Tea, child?
-Yes, please.
Those who want to get wet should walk in the rain. Those who want to be saved...
Oh, child...
Suppose you were to experience that too? Attaining salvation?
Wouldn't that be a miracle?
I used to be just like you: living from one day to the next.
If your grandpa had just tried harder, he might have ended up well.
Shall we read?
Guys, enough dilly-dallying.
Get to work.
The cows won't wait.
She's from the farm where he was an intern.
She's from the seceders. They're more strict than us.
Jannemieke sleeps in your bed this weekend.
Otherwise she'll have to cross the water to Terneuzen tonight.
Jannemieke?
She can serve as an example to you.
-Jannemieke?
With her you can tell she's different.
We have to be strangers on earth.
People have to be able to tell by your actions your face, your words and by the way you dress.
I'll do it.
-Have you really never had a haircut?
-No, we're not allowed.
-Ouch. -Sorry.
Now you've got the sister you always wanted.
Sleep well.
Again?
Maybe you'll go to my school.
In the laundromat?
I attend school every Monday, you know.
Don't forget: Blessed are the ignorant.
You can read as much as you want, but if you don't learn the most important thing you are only a clanging cymbal.
Mom?
Do you think I really have to go to Jannemieke's school?
We'll see.
You can't count on the weather forecast for one bit.
Guys, just one more minute and we'll read the Bible.
Katelijne was looking.
I wouldn't let Rogier slobber all over me.
Come on, lazybones.
Don't make me come up again.
You?
Jeroen's.
Empty again?
I might come even more often next year.
-Having another one?
-Yes.
The doctor was against it, because she always needs a caesarean.
But, ah well...
I've been a naughty boy.
-The ninth is it?
-No, the tenth.
They might as well put in a zipper.
See you.
I'll give the place a good cleaning. It's usually just half done, I think.
Katelijne, can you go and see whether the sheep still have enough water?
Yes.
No!
-You have to help me.
-Rogier, Christiaan get down here!
Yeah a tidy counter and a clean toilet are the signs of a good housewife.
Yes... that's what I mean.
At least you understood.
The water was very black after scrubbing.
I refreshed the water three times and each time it was very black again.
She's quite capable.
Guys, just cut off the black part.
It gives you cancer.
-I heard that the teacher has a TV as well.
-Not true.
Hidden in a cupboard.
When the elders visit, he quickly locks the door.
Not.
-I can smell you were with the cows.
-Not.
A letter from the teacher.
It smells in here.
A sick cow needs a shot.
I can't leave now, but it's at the veterinarian's.
-Fine, I'll go.
-Can I come?
-To Canada?
-If you don't have anything else to do.
We can go for an ice-cream.
I don't want one.
But it's so hot.
It's a cut above, ladies and gentlemen.
It's Sensational Enterprise. Step right up.
-Minderhoud, going out with your girlfriend?
-It's my sister.
-What are you doing here?
-Driving shit.
Satisfied?
I can smell it. No time to wash?
Watch your mouth, OK?
-Feel like having a drink?
-No, we're going for ice-cream.
Here, have a sip.
Look, there's Levine Fagmachine.
Chasing small kids again. -Want a sip?
-Is there alcohol in it?
Only a tiny amount of beer was in it, but that's gone.
-You?
-Throw it in the bin.
Why the rush?
Let's just walk around for a bit.
This is really awesome.
You really have to experience it once.
You've been found out.
Kee Dominisse saw you getting out of one of those revolving things with flashing lights. She said you looked as sick as a dog.
-What else have you been up to?
-Nothing.
I raised you properly, so don't act as if you didn't learn anything.
I'll ask your father to give you a good spanking.
Maybe that will teach you.
Don't look so impudent.
Just my luck to have one like you.
Say: parallelepiped.
Palle...
Pallallepiped.
And: industrial wastewater treatment center.
You moved your head back.
-You're just pushing it in deeper.
-No, I'm not.
It's the only thing I can do.
Cindy has slender fingers.
Not sausages like yours.
Lady hands that are only fit to pick up cutlery.
I bet she's never earthed up a potato.
You can never have a normal conversation.
Come here with your face.
There's a huge blackhead on your nose.
Petra and Eline always lie on their back like this too, you know.
When their parents go to the city on Thursdays they lie naked on the yellow bedspread in their parents' bedroom to try to get a suntan, because they think they're too pale.
Didn't you ever notice they look a bit yellowish on Fridays?
Never paid attention to it.
-I'll take a look tomorrow.
-You should.
Once when they were home alone, a man drove up the driveway.
He got out.
He was a drug addict.
Honestly.
He looked in every window.
Petra and Eveline were in their parents' bedroom, of course.
-You smell weird, by the way.
-Then what happened?
Then...
Then they could only come up with one thing.
That guy took off like a bat out of hell.
When their parents came home, they were still barking.
I was thinking...
When you go to Canada, I'll come with you.
-Were they still naked?
-When?
When their parents returned.
I guess. I'm not exactly sure.
They must have been.
They must have thought he was still there and didn't dare move.
Were they on their backs or on their stomachs?
How should I know?
I wasn't there, was I?
I'm going to the village.
-Demolished it again, moron.
-You are the moron here.
That's the last time I lent you something.
-Ask if you can ride his Zündapp.
-No chance.
-What if I ask him?
-What business is it of yours?
Coming, guys? Christiaan's acting stupid.
Cindy?
Cindy, come on.
And then Gerrit came with his crippled leg and everyone stood up.
Ready? Are you?
-Make sure you behave.
-I will.
You look like your mom, you know.
She had the same radiant smile when she was young.
When your dad saw her for the first time we were sitting in the garden.
Your mom in her short blue dress.
She was radiant, the way you are now.
-My mom?
-Yes.
That's when she met your dad.
Really.
-Aunt?
-Yes?
They're not allowed to wear pants.
Oh?
Why not?
They're men's clothes.
A woman in men's clothes is an abomination to the Lord.
Pink pants are men's clothes?
A little bit.
Gloria, look, my cousin.
Are these fairy tales?
Yes, very famous ones.
Pagan stories.
The witch with the potato face said the girl had to remove all the lentils from the ashes or she couldn't go to the ball.
Fortunately, the pigeons helped her and she was done on time.
Actually, pigeons can't help. Don't believe that.
But you can for now.
A ball doesn't suit our lifestyle and neither does showing off.
Everyone to her own bed now.
Sleep well.
Look...
Well, well.
Very nice.
Did you find that book?
Oh, lamb.
Did you hurt yourself?
Wonderful.
You look like me when I was young.
Wait, I'll style your hair.
Open your eyes.
Darling, you're a beauty.
Take it from me.
Have a look.
No, I've never had a short blue dress.
She's mistaken.
Huh?
Who can that be?
They'll probably be here all night.
You go and play outside.
You can't be here.
That's dangerous, stupid asshole.
Guys?
Guys, Christiaan's getting married.
Come on. Everyone to bed.
Amen.
I'll start with the announcements.
First: Next week there will be a collection for the building fund.
Second: Christiaan Minderhoud and Pieternella Cornelia Davidse made a confession of guilt to the church council last week for breaking the Seventh Commandment.
We'll continue the service by singing Psalm 51 verse 1 and 4.
Behold my remorse.
Hear how a penitent pleads. And cleanse me from all my dirty sins.
have mercy on me, O God according to your unfailing love according to your great compassion
blot out my transgressions against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight
Hello.
Are you by yourself?
Yes. And you?
Are those your parents?
Yes. We live nearby.
Where do you live?
-The Hague.
Aren't you married?
Not anymore.
If no one's waiting for you anyway would you consider...
-What would I consider?
-Well me moving in with you.
Do you really want to?
-Really?
-Really.
And in bed?
How are you in bed?
What?
Can you spread your legs really wide?
Or are you too small for that?
Why were you talking to that man?
Do you know him?
Do you talk to strangers now?
Brazen hussy.
She's not one of ours.
Come on, let's go.
-Zip it up, we're leaving.
-Zip it up, we're leaving.
-Shut your ugly face.
I didn't get this voice for nothing.
The reverend says we have to use our talents.
See?
It worked.
Luckily, I'm more faithful to God than to people.
We'll have to come up with something else soon.
But Christaan's found a job with a harvest company, so we can afford it.
-Do you like living in the village now?
-Terribly.
Really?
-What do you want?
-Want some lemonade?
I should go, actually.
It prickles.
Her report card wasn't as good as last year's.
That could be right.
I have to admit that I was stingy in handing out A's. An A+ may make you think you're perfect.
Kids these days think they're quite something.
They compare grades and thumb their nose at each other.
As long as such a school doesn't alienate her from us.
Or from God.
Let's take it step by step.
This report card allows her to take advanced high school in Goes.
Hey, stop making a racket.
It should be possible here.
First remove that tractor.
-Was my teacher here last night?
-He just wouldn't leave.
He was still here at 1 1 :30.
-What did he want?
-Can't you see we're busy, Katelijne?
Yes!
-Did my teacher say anything yesterday?
-He just wouldn't leave.
But no wonder. There's no one waiting for him at home.
Was that necessary?
Your garden is beautiful.
It is.
I didn't think it would be, after the spring we had.
I wouldn't mind opening up my garden to other garden devotees.
That's a great idea, mom.
That garden is your idol. Why don't you grow cabbage or peas.
The Lord has to wax and I have to wane. That's the way it is.
All that reading.
It will make you as simple as a goat.
Clean some chairs for the party.
OK, go ahead.
I went with Petra again yesterday, so she could try on the dress.
But Petra says I'm not allowed to tell.
That material is so soft.
-Does it have hoops?
-I'm not allowed to tell.
-I'm just allowed to say it's stunning.
-Which color?
Man, my arm hurts.
What do you think?
It's a shame grandpa isn't here for this.
When I think about it, Katelijne, I think: I wonder how he's doing.
I wonder where he is.
I don't dare to think about him ending up so badly.
And you can't really say that he had a wicked character. Right?
He was always glad to help others.
But that's human reasoning. That's...
I think that grandpa is better off than you think.
Remember when I went to the city with grandpa?
Something strange happened on the way home.
You're familiar with the crossroads at the flower meadow.
There was an old woman there.
At that exact moment, grandpa heard singing.
I heard nothing.
Grandpa slowed down to be able to hear it better.
I still heard nothing.
If grandpa hadn't slowed down, we'd both be dead.
Ro never told me.
But then he never told me anything.
It reminded me right away of that psalm.
"The Lord will rescue his servants."
"The righteous person may have many troubles."
"But the Lord delivers him from them all."
Yes, that one.
Grandpa said that that was the psalm he'd heard at the crossroads.
I didn't really talk to grandpa after that.
And at the funeral, I heard that psalm again.
I didn't really dare to talk to anyone about it.
So here you are!
Have you lost your mind completely?
Do you know how much still has to be done.
Thank you for the cookie.
I thank you too, child.
Here!
In a marriage it's the husband's duty as head of the wife to teach her. And in addition he has to comfort and protect her.
Thou woman will obey your lawful husband in all things.
Because is it not true that Adam was created first?
And after that Eve as Adam's handmaiden.
Like Sarah who obeyed her husband Abraham. Naming him 'her Lord'.
as the hart panteth after the water brooks... my soul thirsteth for God living God, O when
shall I come and appear before God?
POLISH TELEVISION
What's going on?
Everything's alright!
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for our panel to make their final statements.
The final statement goes to the representative of the Warsaw Curia, Mr. Jan Bratek.
The floor is yours, sir.
Thank you. I would like to say this here and now. This will be my address to the young viewers.
Everything I was able to achieve over my sixty-some years...
Everything I was able to endure or to avoid... I owe to the Catholic faith.
The choices I made as a youth in 1968, for instance.
Later, the conspiracy and perplexities of my internment in 1981.
During hard times in my life, it was faith that gave me strength.
Strength and a certainty that I was doing the right thing.
I am proud to be a practicing Catholic.
Thank you very much.
Beautiful words.
And now it's time for some questions from the audience.
We have our first caller already.
Go ahead. This is Kasia from Puławy. Good evening.
Good evening.
I have one question for the Chairman.
Could you list the Six Truths of faith?
Could you repeat the question?
Do you know the six Truths of Faith?
I don't know if this is the place for...
It's only six sentences. But of such importance that I wouldn't want to depreciate them.
Excuse me, but I don't really see the...
The old man's going crazy. Get the camera off him.
But what?
The connection with...
FACE TO FACE WITH FAITH
That's it. I'm done. Finished.
Don't worry, Mr Chairman.
It's my fault. I had it upside down.
What are you talking about, Father?
I'm resigning.
If any girl can stump me, then I don't have the right to represent.
The other channels are showing variety shows. Not may people saw it.
It's going to be on those youtubes. This will kill mom.
THE CITIZEN THE CITIZEN This evening in October, 2014 is decisive to the campaign.
Written by This evening in October, 2014 is decisive to the campaign.
Written by This first debate is awaited with great interest.
I can see the presidential motorcade approaching.
Back to you in the studio.
Keep moving. The president will be here.
Go inside, please.
Jesus!
1989 THE FIRST FREE ELECTIONS It's the first free elections!
Mandate number 17 for Solidarity.
Thank you.
"My slogan..."
"When we win, one liter of petrol will cost as little as one liter of milk."
"The chairman of the Workers Committee was brutally beaten..."
"during the occupation of the City Hall."
Mom, no... Just not him. It's some misunderstanding.
But son, between us... You ran away and he got beaten up.
She was so well spoken!
You can tell she's an actress.
So modest.
On June 4th,1989, communism fell in Poland.
Just wonderful!
With her beautiful curly hair!
The Slavic beauty!
...this was my ex-husband's room.
You can put an armoir here.
What do you think?
We can move in next week.
- Good bye.
- Good bye.
Wait a minute!
You have no right to administer this apartment.
I was born here. And the fact that you became my wife in very tragic circumstances...
Jan, cut the crap.
I know how your parents got here.
So, tread lightly.
I'll make a mess you can't handle.
One word out of you and I'll spill it all in court.
Did you see the defendant having relations with with the famous songstress, Anna Jantar, at the resort?
I don't know... He was lying on her and they were singing.
So they were copulating?
Your honor, you cannot sing and copulate simultaneously.
Why not?
Well, I can't.
I warn the defendant.
I apologize.
The witness is dismissed.
I'm closing the case.
A verdict will be reached after deliberation.
Please vacate the courtroom.
I'll destroy you.
You already have.
I suggest you move out.
Or it'll be your necks.
That apartment will never be yours.
We'll see.
What a disgrace!
The verdict is slander towards Poland!
We'll put you in your place yet!
This cannot stand, sir.
We must appeal to the higher court.
Jasiek?
Jan Bratek!
I'd recognize you anywhere.
You know me? No.
Mieczysław Dubel. From primary school.
If you will... I'd like to introduce to you my schoolmate.
In the 50's, he stood up to the Jewry in Poland.
We need such Poles today.
Thank you all very much.
I don't want to bother you. You probably have your hands full.
Here are all my numbers.
I'll find you.
Bye.
The Bratek divorce verdict is ready. Please enter the courtroom.
You're finally free, son.
The nightmare's over.
Go right.
Please vacate the kitchen within the hour. We'll want to eat something soon.
You can see that I'm being nice.
What?
You should demolish this and make one big hallway.
What will happen to us?
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
This is my friend, Jan Bratek.
He'll be working with us.
Sit down right here, Janek.
Short and to the point.
You're the third party in this country.
Solidarity, which won.
The Communists, who lost.
And you.
The future of this parliament lies in your hands.
With your help, we'll find out who is who.
How many real Poles sit in that crowd.
I want to comb every parish, registry office, and family trees.
Excuse me, but I don't understand. Can't we just conduct a poll and ask everyone about their origins?
EXCUSE US, everyone. Our colleague is new.
Whom do they have to fear?
The problem, dear colleague... is that sometimes they themselves do not know. And then we'll be there to help.
This is Professor Ciecierka.
Please explain.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Jews are nation of the Semitic race. And we, Slavs, are of the Aryan race.
Semites exhibit different proportions in skull size. A notch runs from the forehead towards the back of the skull.
Our skulls are completely flat.
The position of the ear in relation to the nose as seen in profile, if one runs a straight line from the tip of the nose...
Jan!
What's the matter?
You don't feel well?
I'm not cut out for this job. I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you that I'm going abroad. Now that it's allowed.
You know... at this moment you're taking the same position as the secret police.
You're going crazy.
I'm sorry, son.
What's going on?
I sold everything.
I can't go on after what she said.
I sold the jewelery, silver, furniture.
Forgive me. But otherwise we will go crazy. We're moving.
We've been here our whole lives. A good life in spite of everything. Why?
I'm afraid.
That Dubel... He's paying you well?
That's finished. I'm looking for work.
The prosecutor has charged the "High Clean" company.
The employees of the cleaning firm were questioned under the suspicion of a possible assassination attempt on the president.
The man injured in the accident is in intensive care.
His condition is serious, but stable.
1994 THE TRAVEL AGENCY November 10th, 1994.
The sun rose at 6:45 am and will set at 3:56 pm. Mr. Bratek...
Yes, Mr. President?
Here's your passport and the group's itinerary.
Barcelona, Costa Brava, and Madrid on the way back.
Something simple to start you off.
You'll collect the vouchers.
How's your language?
I'm attending a course.
Excuse me. You emboldened me. Could we talk?
How to say that I'm shy?
So you do speak Polish?
A little.
Her name was Anna?
No... It was a different name.
Did you know her?
Yes.
It was my entire childhood, my youth... So many emotions, memories...
You look so much like her.
Could you give me her address?
I could write her.
Why? You can talk to her now.
My mother does not know you.
It's a misunderstanding.
Yes, I remember now. It was a completely different name.
Excuse me.
You bastard!
Because of you my children won't be able to get back from holiday!
What's going on?
We're bankrupt.
The boss ran off. There is no way of getting the group home.
You're the oldest one here. They will respect you.
Go out there and talk to them. They'll lynch us!
Their respect for me is obvious.
If I go out there, they might rape me.
I see your point.
I'll cover you.
Everyone!
Please, calm down!
I have an announcement.
Our travel agency is closed until further notice.
Please calm down.
The owner is currently abroad and does not take the financial responsibility for...
Because of this man, you won't be going on vacation.
We are not going anywhere!
Please understand, we're all probably out of a job. I was supposed to go abroad in a week. For the first time in my life.
- What's the patient's condition?
- Aśka! The old man's on TV!
The patient's condition is serious, but stable.
We'll get answers only when he'll be taken out of the induced coma.
Will the patient be able to testify after such trauma?
These cases often cause permanent damage.
He could have permanent amnesia.
2006
Good morning.
Supposedly, you were in a folk group once.
I was.
Do you play anything?
A harmonica, but only a little.
But you can read music?
Yes.
You know... It would be nice, if during our meeting with Frasyniuk, The boys played "The First Brigade".
That's how it goes.
That's shit, Professor!
We got something better.
Move that ass!
Move that ass!
And twist it! Move it for me, nice and dirty, and then let me lick it!
You know what that is?
That's crass.
What'd you say, punk?
It's crass.
What?
!
I don't feel like listening to you or looking at you!
What are you doing?
!
You little prick!
Insult me, will you? !
Someone should give you a good beating!
Serves you right, grandpa!
Grandpa... I recorded you. You got a problem.
Please wait in the hall.
Good bye. Mr. Bratek, we have a decision from the teacher's disciplinary committee.
Read this part, maybe.
"After a survey among the students, the committee asserts that you are guilty of offending your class at the Vocational High School in Warsaw and threatened one of them with bodily harm.
The commission motions for the teacher's immediate termination and revokes his teaching license permanently.
2008 Yeah, I'm coming.
I'll be in a cab in 5 minutes.
Boy, we got lucky.
The battle itself is worth 30 day wages. They want hussars here all the time. Mr. Bratek...
A year's worth of work. Make sure to be next to Gaps.
Get filmed next to King Sobieski, and they'll need you till the end.
I saw Gajos. I should have been a Turk. I wouldn't have to carry all this junk around.
Everyone, gather around!
Attention!
We're calling off primary photography.
Quiet!
The production of "Sobieski At Vienna"
is being stopped for organizational reasons.
Quiet!
We will let you know if the shooting is back on.
We apologize.
Scandal!
An international conspiracy!
They sold it to the Italians!
I overheard Gajos talking on the phone!
They sold us out!
We're starting a union!
Let me help you with those wings.
You won't be needing them.
And the helmet.
Thank you.
- Go to the other bus.
- I'm staying.
What will do here?
Hang myself.
I assure you we will finish this film about your great king.
Please help me.
I found myself in a very embarrassing situation.
My door...
I locked myself out.
Please help me.
I'm begging.
Please, come in.
Why me?
Why is it always me?
Why is it always...
Someone...
Something...
Somewhere...
Thanking the Lord for all the grace we experience, we ask for strength that will help us overcome our weaknesses.
And with this hope and prayer on this holiday of Corpus Cristi let us walk to the next altar.
We want the Lord, oh blessed virgin...
I will never forget what you did for me.
This will be a great victory.
A natural course of affairs.
There are many young people interested as our survey tells us.
Thank you very much.
It's my biggest achievement since working in the Curia. A good number of years.
Yes, thank you.
Tomorrow.
We start the pilgrimage tomorrow.
We're in Tel Aviv one night. Then it's off to Jerusalem.
Of course... I'll walk the entire way. To the grave.
No, without...
What do you mean I can rent one?
What?
An Arab rents them?
No...
Your Eminence walked?
Now that's doing penance.
How's your vacation?
It's warm there, even at night, yes...
God bless. Have a good holiday. I'll see you in Warsaw.
Good bye.
You can turn this off, Father Stanisław.
Here's your passport. And the tickets.
Mine, finally.
Valid until 2024.
I won't live that long. Father Stanisław, a few words about the TV program...
So that I know something.
It's called "Face To Face With Faith".
It's a show aimed at young people.
Mr. Bratek,
You have a visitor.
Son...
Do you recognize me?
I will read you what you wanted.
The Truths of Faith.
First, there is a God.
Second, God is just.
Third, there is one God in three persons.
The human soul is immortal.
1 981 Can you hear this song and guitars playing, Pamela?
It's boys from our pueblo singing.
We leave tomorrow at dawn.
The sky's skimping raindrops for the dry earth...
The sky's skimping luck for people poor like us.
Darling, this is our last night together.
Remember this, mom?
Where did you find it?
Somewhere behind the closet.
I'm not here!
Yes?
Good evening.
We're here to see your son.
Solidarity from the dairy.
My son's away. Mrs. Bratek, we need to see him.
It can get dangerous tonight.
He's not in Warsaw.
Thank you, gentlemen. Good bye.
Please warn him, Mrs. Bratek.
Scaring people again, making trouble. Did I tell them right?
Bothering me when the bigos is waiting.
Jesus!
I'm out of salt.
Son... Borrow some from the Lipskis.
Yes?
Come in.
I wanted to borrow some salt.
What's going on?
An anniversary of some sort?
They're combing the place.
Sir, I am a neighbor. I came here in my slippers.
Want a beating?
Keep your mouth shut.
Two bees to the hive.
Over. This is the hive. Over and out.
Stop. Everyone quiet.
Yes?
Come in.
I wanted to borrow some salt.
Jesus Christ!
By the power of Martial Law introduced this very moment
you are all to be interned.
You are all charged as members of the anti-government group, ŻUPA.
Your usage of the password and response determined today acts as proof on December 13th, 1981.
The password being, "Yes, Come in."
The response:
"I wanted to borrow some salt."
Cuff them!
On the way down. Over and out.
The one in slippers did not get the password from me.
The snitch is wearing slippers. Pass it on.
1982 THE INTERNMENT CAMP Before today's schedule an announcement:

Let's sign.
Not you, but thanks.
The flower of the nation is singing from behind steel bars that Poland is still standing.
It fights, it lives, until the Commies give in...
It fights the Premiere's goons.
We've got a war.
Those who snitch stay alive. They shut down Wałęsa, they bought Kułaj...
We've got a war.
Those who snitch stay alive.
Mr. Lipski, why can't we go to the psychologist?
You need it most here.
You're a bit paranoid suspecting everyone.
I'm going to go. I have the need.
Who's going to stop me?
Why'd I go to borrow salt from you?
And stayed...
Ask your conscience.
Tell 'em about throwing your party membership away!
Gentlemen, fourth verse...
Good morning. May I?
Please, come in...
Thank you for deciding to come.
I'm just here to chat, really.
I'm a bit bored.
You're my first patient. None of your friends visit.
Pity. They talk about one thing:
"Out with Commies!"
And Solidarity, naturally.
Please lie down.
Let's begin.
How old are you?
35.
How do you handle isolation?
That's why I'm here.
Very badly.
Mainly because my being here is a misunderstanding.
We have to be honest with each other.
I am. It was an accident.
You don't want to be honest. We'll have to work on that.
You react like my fellow inmates.
I'm even proud that they harass me.
I thought it would be worse. Like being tortured...
The worst torture comes from them. Accusing me of being an agent, a traitor... It's horrible.
What are you going to about it?
I don't know.
I'm not going back to Solidarity.
I understand.
A change of subject. Have you ever been in love?
I was.
It was a... youthful... A childhood love, really.
That's touching.
It never happened to me.
I said too much.
No!
Why?
It's very human.
It was love and I threw it away.
I don't know... I was a coward. I can't talk about it.
In my dreams.
I have enough material.
I have to analyze it with the Robson method.
This will conclude our session.
And you have to tell your fellow inmates openly.
In public. Even ostentatiously!
Write it down and learn it by heart.
You disparage human dignity by throwing suspicion on an innocent man.
What do you know about me, Mr. Lipski?
It's easy to throw slander around. But resigning from the Party is not. That required courage.
Must your desire for conspiracy destroy people's lives?
As a colleague and an innocent man... I will be left with that disgrace my entire life. Because Communism will never fall.
We've been seeing each other for two months now.
A pity that in such circumstances, but that will change soon.
I'm glad to be the first to tell you. You're walking out tomorrow.
How do you know, Renia?
Jesus, I will go crazy. They asked me for my opinion and I sniffed it out.
But one more thing... Our sessions are over.
Why?
But you helped me so much.
Every therapy forbids any relationship between the patient and the doctor. And unfortunately, I broke this rule.
What happened?
What do you think?
I fell for you, stupid.
Not a word more.
Bye.
Such a dreadful place. Yet so happy for me.
Please accept this engagement ring that I made from barbed wire.
How original.
Can I kiss you now?
Mom... Let me finally...
Introduce Renatka, my fiance.
She saved me through all this time.
I take you in as a daughter.
This home will be your home.
I never had a home.
Poor child. I will take care of you.
But, dear children, you will wait with getting married?
Jan doesn't have a job.
And he was in jail.
Who will employ him?
Renatka took care of it. We have a meeting today. If all goes well, I start on Monday.
She is amazing.
Just look, son.
With God's help you can leave hell with an angel... A guardian angel. For life.
We'll be so happy here.
Mr. Bratek, what would you like to do?
I've always wanted to travel and write about it. Like Budrewicz or Kapuściński. But I don't know how it would be.
There might be a problem with that. Because what we have to offer falls under state secret.
You won't get a passport.
This factory is a priority establishment and there can be no Solidarity here.
Mrs. Halinka!
Why don't you go and see your work place.
Renatka, a word.
I'm glad. I hope you have a good time working in Kusza.
I hereby declare that on May 25th 1982,
Miss Renata Zgółka and Mr. Jan Bratek became husband and wife. And as a gift, a ration card for 20 liters of octane fuel.
Please sign for it here.
You may congratulate the married couple.
Son, will I ever see you vowing in front of God?
We will convince her now for sure.
Hello?
A moment... It's from your work. Urgent.
Jadźka, have you gone mad?
Do you have any idea what you're interrupting?
How many hours?
Stop fucking around.
Six hours of questioning and you got nothing out of her?
That's a disgrace.
Say goodbye to your bonus.
Yeah?
What do you mean she can't contact the resident?
Sure...
She doesn't know Paris!
You let her feed you that?
Please...
What?
Tell her that tomorrow, I will or Jarek will go to the rector and her scholarship is fucked.
Tell her that.
Stop pissing me off.
She got a passport to work for us, not to fuck around with scientific nonsense.
What?
Yeah.
Of course!
And... If she still won't, her father's on the street within a week.
We've got ways.
Renatka, was that some kind of joke?
If it was, I don't... I don't understand.
What questioning?
What resident? I don't understand.
Honey...
I'm a captain in the security service. Didn't you realize?
Sweet Lord!
What happened?
Mommy!
I let the secret police into our house.
What did I do?
I wanna die!
Save me!
Mommy!
That night... I aged decades.
You prick.
Siccing Jews on me.
They're forcing me to move.
Prick!
Wheeze away...
Who sent this Silber guy on me?
Maybe it was his idea to come from America?
You knew when to move, you fuck.
Fucking me over like this.
I'll pull these tubes out of your guts.
Visiting hours are over!
Please leave.
You'll have visitors from America tomorrow, so get ready.
To rebuke any hostile claims by Western media towards Socialist Poland.
Start the demonstration.
Their claims addressed the products of this factory.
That we provide a different service altogether.
After me, please.
We are now in the finishing hall.
Thanks to modern technology and a highly qualified staff two sewing machines leave the assembly line every minute.
The final station is quality control where the final product is approved.
Please translate.
Wait.
Lift it, Rysiu.
Girls!
You were great. So brave!
There will be a reward!
Dear ladies,
The May holiday is upon us.
Times are changing. As is the way we will celebrate.
No more parades!
We're getting along weekend.
Perestroika.
The directors are inviting all of you to a May picnic in the holiday resort of our sister factory, Łucznik.
Agnieszka!
Stop shooting for a moment!
Married ladies are invited to bring their husbands.
And the single ladies will have the pleasure meeting the men from Łucznik.
Yes, Mrs. Wiaderna?
You were in Solidarity, Mr. Bratek. Have you gone crazy?
If anyone goes, she's a backstabber!
What?
You'd prefer sitting on styrofoam?
And plotting?
And here I worked my ass off to get this for us.
Yes, I was in the Solidarity. And let me tell you, none of us here can demolish the Berlin Wall.
Remember that!
To hell with all that!
For every lady attending the May picnic, the committee has prepared a surprise.
Extra ration cards for sweets and spirits.
And now, another song for our nice gentlemen.
"Oh, Izabella"!
Why'd they do this to me?
Those hussies!
You save their jobs and they turn their backs on you.
The Director's mad. At Bratek, of course.
It's always like this. Always.
When you try doing some good. For it to be nice.
Bloody women!
It's Solidarity that they want.
Let's hope they won't tell any papers about the cover up.
That would be a mess.
Fuck it. I'm having fun.
One second.
I must!
Rysiek!
Are you crazy?
I only want to sing with her!
Don't you understand that?
I have to sing with her!
Screw you.
Can you hear those guitars playing, Pamela?
It's the boys from our pueblo singing.
I apologize profusely. But today, my life's dream must come true. And it will, because I'll sing with you.
The sky's skimping raindrops for the dry earth.
The sky's skimping luck for people poor like us.
It's bed time, Director.
I beg you. Just sing.
Darling, this is our last night together.
Will you be quiet for fuck's sake?
The city glitters beyond those empty steppes.
Think this is a brothel?
I'm fucking calling the militia!
I'll send a letter and you'll come to see me.
"The True Face Of Their People."
"An orgy in the prestigious resort... with participation of ex-Solidarity management."
You're done, Bratek.
You compromised, embarrassed, and disappointed us.
Sir, please allow me to behave with dignity and offer my resignation. Hopefully, in an amicable manner.
Get out!
What's the matter, Mr. Bratek?
Don't cry.
You have a visitor.
Don't be long.
Can you hear me?
My name is Silber, Shlomo. I'm the son of Joszko from Poznańska street. Where your father was a caretaker.
I came from Haifa.
The tenement is mine again.
Can you tell me... Where are my parents' belongings? Furniture, tableware.
A nice lady at the apartment told me that you and your mother took it all somewhere.
There was a silver sugar bowl. An heirloom.
His blood pressure jumped!
Leave, sir. The visit is over.
I asked him an important question.
Can't you see the patient is in critical condition because of you?
Good bye.
He cannot be wrapped like this.
His face will be red for the rest of his life.
I'm a dermatologist.
I said get out.
Damn Yid.
It will start now. Mr. Bratek...
Don't wheeze.
1968
Step aside for the strike committee!
"Don't be surprised, that they curse us.
For a century, from Moscow to Poland they send crowds of scoundrels."
Adam Mickiewicz, "The Forefathers Eve".
"Moscow's sparrows are very dangerous, I see." Also "Forefather's Eve".
About us, without us!
Introductions:
The rector and the dean.
The Party Organization.
The delegate from Lublin.
The crowd is rowdy and time is scarce. I give the floor to the delegate.
I apologize for being so tired, but I've been traveling for two days.
I haven't eaten. I had to stay hidden.
Real quick:
My mission is important.
I was sent by people from my university who think exactly like you.
But who I can't officially represent now.
I'll be brief, because the crowd is pushing.
The Polish Workers' Party must be destroyed. And it can only be done from the inside.
20 universities are already in.
Strike committees have enrolled in the party.
Within a few months, they'll disable it from the inside.
People!
This is the real revolution. This is March on a European scale.
This country will soon be ours.
And the Russians?
Dear colleague, that is demagogy and provocation.
Don't scare us with the Russians.
That's not what I wanted to say.
Excuse me. Who is the First Secretary?
You, sir!
I ask the First Secretary for a guarantee that those people will be safe after they've joined the Party.
Any questions?
THE MANDATORY MILITARY TRAINING This is our chance.
THE MANDATORY MILITARY TRAINING We trust each other, it's all in our hands, we'll chase the Russians.
I don't know. I'm in.
If nothing changes, we're fucked for life.
You're fucked?
You're fucked for life, if I'm not behind you.
Party wiseguys-.
Want me to fuck you up?
Break's over.
Lieutenant... It's stuck.
Get down!
Hold the gun up! Hold it up!
Now it works!
The fucker wanted to kill me.
Fucking school boy...
Get down!
Crawl!
On all fours!
Stand guard by the bushes!
Go!
Fall in!
Polish philologist step forward!
Sir, the person you asked for.
Turn it off.
This is highly classified.
Here are the topics. Chose one.
You'll be writing in my office till 11:45.
I'll take the shooting range off your shoulders this semester.
What's this?
High school finals?
All right. I need to know for whom. And where?
For my girlfriend. In a cooking vocational school.
Night school. A nice doll.
THE JEWISH CULTURAL ASSOCIATION And now, listen to love.
I want poetry for you. And send it all around.
Invite to the wedding, all the strange things, the flowers, the bushes, the lightning, songs and humming!
And the Straw Man?
You believe now?
It has taken you.
The straw, the wilted rose, the night.
It's a supernatural force. There could be a wedding party.
Jude Raus!
Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we have to stop.
It's a pity that it needs to be under such circumstances.
Ania is with us for the last time.
- How long have you been here?
- 1956.
So she's been with us 12 years.
Let's give her a warm and affectionate farewell.
She's leaving the country soon.
Please go. You can see what's going on.
I'll call the militia.
They won't harm me. I'll secure the windows.
Leave through the back.
I want to do it now. For the first time. With you.
In Poland.
I bought them as you asked.
"Please accept me as a candidate for the Polish United Workers Party? !"
Son, I beg you, don't do this!
Your father did and he died!
A coincidence.
Now we have a chance to have the Party dad always wanted. Without Russians, without Gomulka, and the secret police.
We have a candidate for the First Secretary at the university.
Our friend, Adam Michnik.
Maybe, he'll go for it.
Oh, God.
Mom, it's a revolution!
Excuse me.
Hello?
Janek's not here.
Ania, I sympathize deeply, but please don't call here again.
It could harm us.
But you are leaving and we are staying here.
Janek has to finish university. I don't want any trouble.
Yes.
No. It will be for the best.
All right, I will tell him. But I can't hear you well.
Good bye.
Where are you going?
The station. To see Ania off.
I didn't tell you. She phoned. She left yesterday.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
So you don't do anything stupid. Agents are spying, taking photos.
I'm sorry.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
1971 1971 Congratulations.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Together, we will do good work.
Young comrades, I think that the best way to end today's ceremony will be the First Secretary's speech.
Let's sit.
Comrade Bratek, sit next to me.
I would like to use your zeal, honesty, and mettle.
Where would you feel best serving?
I don't know... Something to do with culture.
We've been having a lot of trouble with our university folk group, "Kujawiak".
You would become the new artistic director.
I've had some problems with their travels abroad.
Beautiful!
Bravo!
Sir, I've made up my mind. I would write about the first flower show in Brussels.
I will be there in a few days when they will be putting a flower carpet on the main square.
It should really be something.
I can write something about its wastefulness.
But who is being taken advantage of?
The people setting it up?
All right, I can try...
Would it be possible?
Sir, the rehearsal is almost over.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jan Bratek.
I am the new manager of the group.
Considering the group's unquestionable merits, lam extremely proud and intend to continue this tradition.
We face a serious task. A prestigious tour in the Benelux countries. We will be ambassadors of Polish culture.
The face of the new government.
We must do this with dignity.
I will stand guard over this.
I hereby introduce a ban on drinking alcohol on the bus, the transport of any powdered soups, jars of pickled meat, noodles, rice, and cereals.
Not to mention foreign currency or crystals.
That is why the ministry of culture gives us 5 dollars in per diems so we can live on their level.
Sir, have you ever been to the Western Europe?
No. This will be my first trip.
That's why I'm counting on your understanding and cooperation.
Please go back to your rehearsal. I will see you later.
What did we say?
! To storage.
Jarczak.
- Good.
- Koronkiewicz.
They don't have sausage?
Sir, can I take your suitcase to the bus?
Yes, please. Thank you.
Angowska.
You're kidding?
To storage.
After we cross the border return your passports to me.
So that they don't get lost.
Looks good.
You can all pack your things.
We just need to check that.
That's my harmonica. Some harmonica. Wait, maybe it's not...
It is my case. Someone must have put it there.
Everybody says that.
Check this for me.
Sir, I've never that money in my life.
Someone planted it.
Please come with me.
Sir, this is a misunderstanding.
One moment.
Counterfeit.
That complicates things. We will have to detain you and inform the militia and the prosecutor.
The rest of you can go.
Unfortunately, your friend won't be joining you.
Who framed me?
Whose money is it? !
This way.
Wait for me!
On April 18th, 1971 the Party Commission, analyzed the case of Comrade Jan Bratek motions to revoke his Party membership.
Please return your party identity card.
Comrade Chairman, comrades...
It's my personal tragedy that no one believed my version of events.
No one believed me or even assumed that I might be telling the truth.
If this is how you see your members, don't be surprised that the country is run by the secret police. Though you are convinced that you do.
What happened was a provocation.
And Comrade Chairman... I won't return my identity card.
I'm throwing it away.
First Secretary Ulbricht of the Unified Socialist German Party has resigned.
Erick Honecker was elected to replace him.
lam the new milkman.
If you'd like fresh rolls or the newspaper, please let me know.
Your name please?
It's good to know.
Bratek?
Yes. They talked about you on Radio Free Europe.
What?
No!
You managed some folk group.
Yes.
You threw down your Party membership card.
Nowak-Jeziorański did an editorial.
You're the first in the country.
You'll need help.
I'd like some rolls... and a newspaper...
Here you go. An advance.
It's too much.
You deserve it for your courage.
Let me embrace you.
The name's Lisieja.
I'm a high school teacher.
I hate Bolsheviks.
Who is it?
You did not put out your empty milk bottles.
One moment. I'm not dressed.
I'm sorry.
Good morning. I'm the new milkman.
So handsome and nice.
Careful.
She works at the Internal Affairs cafeteria.
Snitching again, Lisieja?
Can't keep your mouth shut for a single day?
Good morning. I'm the new milkman.
Lisieja called. We know all about you. We heard it, too.
Son... I cried when Jeziorański applauded you.
Please accept this. It was my husband's. An officer's eagle.
He got it from General Anders.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Good bye.
Good morning. I am the new milkman.
What do you want?
Oh, bottle is here. Excuse me.
Good bye. 1972-1976 This is Bohdan Tomaszewski in Sapporo.
19-year-old Wojtek Fortuna has won the gold medal in the ski jump in Japan!
A victory Poland was waiting for.
Today is a great day in the history of Polish sport.
Ryszard Szurkowski won his 4th bicycle Peace Race.
The Olympic silver medalists crowned his achievement with this amazing win.
It's over, ladies and gentlemen!
The Poles have won third place!
Grzegorz Lam's goal brought us this well-deserved success.
The jury of the 9th International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition awards the first prize to Krystian Zimmerman.
Excuse me. Mr. Bratek?
Yes, that's me.
We work with the Workers' Defense Committee. Our friends from Radio Free Europe highly recommend you. You could bring down Communism.
Nice words, but I have milk to deliver.
Excuse me.
Don't say no.
Add one pamphlet to each milk bottle. A note about what those fuckers are doing to the Constitution. They want to sell us to the Russians.
Paid traitors.
Let me see.
Give me that.
Jacek Kuroń invites you to come tonight.
We meet at 11 pm on Miodowa 6.
Gentlemen, I'll distribute those pamphlets as an act of personal revenge. But I just want to be let alone.
Please tell him that.
That's a shame.
At least, thank you for that.
Go to the kitchen. One moment!
Jan Bratek came in here a moment ago. We're searching the apartment.
What are you talking about?
Do you know where you are?
I work for Internal Affairs. Here's my card.
Get out before I call Kiszczak!
I'm charged with surveillance of this building.
I'll go secure the milk cart. Excuse me.
Right.
Sweet Christ. Those assholes were agents.
- How will I get out?
- You won't.
It's fate.
I'm Kama. Want something to eat?
Kama...
I know it's hard, but don't shout my name. They're downstairs.
Who'd have thought I could be so happy because of them.
Hard to believe.
Maybe you'd like some pierogi?
We made them today.
I was thinking. If I did stay...
But my mom will die of loneliness.
I'll go to her. In secret.
Marvelous!
Maybe I can finish my MA thesis. I'd finally have some time.
Would you bring me books?
Of course.
Kazia in the library...
Funny!
But you have to tell me how to borrow those books. I don't really know.
Someone even wrote my final exam for me at the night.
How-Z?
Just like that.
My fiance was a lieutenant. He taught some military course or something.
My exams came up. I gave him the topics. Some soldier wrote it and they got it back to me.
I copied it and that was it.
What grade did you get?
A "C".
Make me squeal again.
1978
I'm back!
I got your books from the library. They didn't have Janion.
I took your mom some ribs. We've got some, too.
Kiszczak said they're really good.
I will not eat the same food as him!
I've already gained 12 kilos!
And stop calling me that!
But Janek...
What's the matter?
Give me a moment.
I traded some vouchers for it.
Jesus.
It's not?
I'm sorry.
I am proud to be able to tell you this news. We have a new head of the Vatican.
The Cardinal from Poland, Metropolitan Bishop of Cracow,
Cardinal Karol Wojtyła.
John Paul ll.
I'm leaving Internal Affairs.
I'll pray for you.
How does it go?
"I don't recollect any more sins...
I regret them all, I will try to make amends.
I ask you, Father, for penance... and absolution." Thank you.
From Via Del Corso, I turned towards Piazza Colonna and I could see the Pantheon. It's gray, bulky shape.
This is shit, not a report.
"Grey Shape"?
I visited your mom. I brought her some ribs. A letter for you.
What's wrong?
What happened?
I went to the Norbertine nuns. I saw the Mother Superior. They refused to take me.
She said,
"The world ate the flower. Let it eat the stem."
People from the dairies want to meet with me. They're looking for me.
Somethings up.
Our kitchen got 100 extra kilos of meat. For the riot police.
Hi.
This seat is taken, Madam.
It's me, Jan.
Thursday meeting, right?
You got guts.
You made it.
You didn't give in to the secret police.
You're my idol.
We're putting together a plan.
Wałęsa's orders.
We need leaders. Only you can do it.
Everyone is rallying on the A4 highway.
I was away for almost 4 years. I've been completely alone.
Irrelevant. We need legends.
And you are one in the dairy community.
No...
Then who threw his red card down first?
Who distributed pamphlets first?
Who's evading the police?
Without you. We can't lead the people.
I'm not cut out for this. I don't even want to.
But you have to!
Everyone!
Look who I brought!
Jan Bratek is with us!
Everyone!
Before we welcome Jan, there is an important announcement from the regional authorities.
We occupy city hall in an hour.
If the authorities will not meet with us by morning, we will do a hunger strike!
All major factories in town will be represented. We need to be there, too. And I elect
Jan Bratek as our delegate!
I welcome him warmly!
Wait a moment!
We have to ask him because it can become a hunger strike.
Do you accept?
If need be... Will you refrain from eating?
With pleasure.
Solidarity!
Jan Bratek accepts!
Bravo!
Listen!
Listen!
Students from the Theater School are here to recite a poem by
Czesław Miłosz for us.
You, who wronged a simple man. Bursting into laughter at the crime, And kept a pack of fools around you.
To mix good and evil, blurring the line. Though everyone bowed down before you, Saying virtue and wisdom lit your way.
The poet remembers.
You can kill one, but another is born.
Written down will be your deeds and words.
For you a winter dawn will be warmer, a rope and a branch bent by your weight.
That's it?
Fucking beautiful.
Almost better than this:
It's the Commies, not the leaves, that will hang from the trees.
Sir, drink this. You're weak.
What is it?
Tomato juice.
But this is a hunger strike. Just water.
I'm sorry. I'll leave it. Just in case.
Announcement!
Zazula from Mosostal:
Your wife's in labor.
Siwczyk from MPRG:
Your father had an accident.
Bratek from the Dairies:
You mother's in a hospital. Heart attack.
Jesus Christ!
I have to go.
Wait. They're trying to provoke us.
Stop talking shit, you Commie bastard!
We want our demands met immediately!
Come on!
You'll be carrying out our corpses!
You red pig!
In 30 seconds, we will take actions in order to stop this illegal occupation of the city hall
We will use force.
They will attack in a minute.
We put up the cross and now we will tie ourselves to it.
We'll be hard to move.
Do you have a belt?
No, just suspenders.
Wait, I'll ask.
Nurses, vacate now.
This is your last warning!
Leave willingly.
No hitting. Pass it on.
No hitting.
Counting down!
10!
$2
Unfortunately, suspenders won't do.
I'm sorry.
Are you joining us?
No sense in prayer. We have to fight the Gestapo.
'V.!
No hitting. 2!
No hitting. 1!
Too late.
Only under the cross, only beneath it's sign Poland is Poland and Poles are Poles.
Hit me!
You puppet of Moscow!
God damn it!
This is how it'll be!
People!
Solidarity!
They're beating Poles!
So?
Victory?
I've been looking for you in all the hospitals!
Why?
I've been home.
You're back!
Mom...
I'm done fighting. For either side.
Let me finish!
Your party is responsible for the attempt on the president's life.
I will not listen to this on national TV.
Mr. Bratek, the TV claims you're dying.
But here you sit... Sit nicely...
Here's your tube. Eat.
Eat nicely.
Please, come in.
You have visitors.
The doctor forbade talking about tomorrow's events.
Son!
I'm here to see you.
Tomorrow's your big day!
The biggest day of your life, son.
I brought you new pajamas.
And look who came with me.
Come in!
Hello, do you recognize me?
I pray for you often.
The Carmelites accepted me. 20 years now.
Jan...
I heard you work with his Excellency.
Could you put in a good word for me?
I'd love to cook for him.
Oh, damn it. You ladies have to go.
Excuse me.
He starts acting out.
Bad boy.
1953
Daddy...
What's Silber?
Silver, son. Remember it.
Off to bed.
But I have to repeat the poem with mom.
Tomorrow.
- Will we sing?
- In bed.
Cuba is an island hot as a volcano. A man puts his fan up to the sun. And the sun smiles down upon it.
Go to sleep.
If he asks about Silber again, I'll go mad.
He'll ask about the furniture, The bed covers and everything else.
Let's sell it and move.
I'll go crazy.
Don't be hysterical.
If one of them Jews comes back, you'll see hysteria.
They won't be back.
And the survivors?
If they did, they set themselves up nicely in the West.
The sly fox... Why'd he care about bed covers and a sugar bowl?
It's their nature.
I take the series with Nicaragua. And give you Madagascar and two nibs.
Look, he's got Cuba.
Indonesia.
Can I have Cuba?
Sure.
But for 50 groszy.
I believe in one God
who created everything
and rules everything.-
You got ripped off.
Nicaragua's worth both Madagascar and Cuba.
We're not pay attention!
Remember this for the rest of your life.
There is one God incarnated in three persons.
I even gave him 50 groszy.
I'll shout.
Let Jan shout.
I won't shout.
Then I will.
You Jew!
Why'd You go to a Jew?
He had Cuba.
Daddy...
Can I get 50 groszy?
Give it to him.
Those who get duped by a Jew don't get an allowance.
Where did we finish the poem?
"And mom was yelling..." Right?
Mom was yelling,
"Bambo, you brat!"
But Bambo, just smiles at that.
His mother tells him, "Drink some milk."
But escapes up a tree. Naturally. Like a monkey.
His mother says,
"Go wash yourself. And be polite." But he's afraid that he'll turn white.
You can't see dirt on a black.
But mom still loves her little son, even if he's a little, black one.
It's a shame that Bambo, so black and so gay Can't go to school with us everyday.
That's what we need.
But Tuwim would probably like that.
This is how you should recite it.
Bratek, stop. Line up.
We'll be placing flowers here tomorrow.
Each of you will approach with a flower and bow with respect.
Tomorrow, we'll do the whole poem. But today, just the ending.
Złotowska.
But mom still loves her little son, even if he's a little, black one.
What's the meaning of this?
!
Who taught you that?
My dad told me to say it like that.
Hand!
Dubel, Bratek, Krawczyk and Wasilewski!
To the director's office.
Now! "On April 18th of this year, your students came to my store and yelled antisemitic slurs as instructed by their priest."
That's how it is.
The priest had already been arrested for questioning.
Jesus Christ, impossible!
Quite possible, Mrs. Bratek!
Where would they learn these slurs?
At home?
!
Citizen Kozłowski, point to one who yelled.
I can't be sure.
But the leader was my neighbor's son, young Bratek.
Oh, God!
So?
Relegation?
Director, maybe we could do this another way?
Comrade Secretary proposes another solution.
Resocialization at the TSKŻ.
Where?
!
The Jewish Cultural Association.
I know what it is.
But in Poland.
You understand. Today.
Citizen Kozłowski agrees?
No way.
They'll change my child there.
Maybe into matza.
Stop.
But sir, that's a foreign element. Not Catholic.
Why our you talking about Catholicism in a Socialist country?
Want to be blacklisted?
Want Bratek in a reform school?
Fear not. They will suffer the consequences.
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Bratek, excuse my tone in there, but he's a very sensitive man.
Concerning that association...
It's nothing, really. They'll go once or twice. Recite a poem.
It won't do any harm.
We're already getting organized, so we can keep an eye on everything.
Better keep an eye on them when they visit Angelika after school.
Daddy...
- I don't want to go to reform school.
- Quiet, you!
You've done enough!
You're coming home right after school.
You're getting a beating.
Who's this Angelika?
I will order the Straw Man, call him to the chambers For the wedding. Maybe you will trust him.
That Rachel tells the truth.
Your name is Rachel?
Does it change anything?
Stop!
Ania... Come here, child.
"Does it change things?" means you're scared of him.
You have to fear him. He's a Pole. A Goy.
Your name is Rachel?
Does it change anything?
Very good!
What does he say?
You are blushing.
Which means?
She's ashamed!
For she's a Jew.
Invite whomever you want.
You're name so lyrical.
True. And lovely.
Now you like him!
He's not antisemitic.
Jan, very good!
And now, listen to love. I want poetry for you.
For you, for them, for Poles. Because they can't see it. They don't have a nose for it.
Sit down and I'll read something to you.
On the hill overgrown with thistle, stood Doboszowa's inn.
She was Dobosz's widow.
He was an infamous robber.
The scare of Polish roads, robbing merchants traveling to Warsaw, Cracow, Gdańsk, and Leipzig.
When they finally hung him, Doboszowa married Lapitut.
He was half man, half devil.
My blood is bursting through my ears when I listen to that.
You have your Elijahs,
Davids, and prophets...
But if they're robbers, half devils and black magic, it's Doboszowa!
And you teach that to the kids.
- I'll burst in a minute!
- But sir...
This is Singer!
Singer Schminger. Make sewing machines and stop spoiling children's minds.
We're going home this instant!
I'm waiting downstairs. Now!
Rehearsal's over.
I had fun talking to you on stage.
Can I kiss you?
Last seconds of the game and Gerard Cieślik scores!
Will you carry my schoolbag home?
Sure.
Złotowska is in love!
Schoolmates!
Let's go to Angelika's!
Angelika!
Show yourself!
And?
A boy, I think.
Jesus, let it be so.
His name will be Jan.
- Shall I take it off?
- Yes.
Holy fuck.
It won't get any better.
Is something wrong?
Let's get up, Mr. Bratek.
It's a very special moment.
For the first time ever, our highest national distinction will be given to a man who saved the President from a terrorist attack. Mr. Bratek has paid dearly for his good deed.
The President decided to hold the ceremony with full honors.
Due to the size of the building, the army is represented by a symbolic few.
The guests are approaching.
Halt!
About face!
Present arms!
Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.
You shouldn't have brought them.
-But dad is out there.
Take cover. Port, get ready to fire.
-Get ready to fire. Hard to starboard.
Admiral Tromp is trapped.
Square away the yards.
Michiel, this is madness.
-Luff up to port.
Luff up to port.
We can't leave Tromp to die.
Chop it. Chuck that mast overboard.
Chop.
We'll push those idiot English back to their island.
Until death, admiral.
-Go straight.
Mainsail halyard.
To port.
-Get ready to tack.
Get ready to fire.
Michiel.
I can make this a lot easier for you. All you have to do, is tell the truth.
You were part of a conspiracy to assassinate the Prince of Orange.
There are witnesses.
I don't see how you want to deny...
-Yes, that's highly unfortunate.
I can't turn this into more than an exile.
I assume you don't want to end up here yourself.
The admiral...
He's calling all captains. Get a sloop ready.
You want to row there?
-You, you and you jump in, come on.
Michiel?
You're just in time.
You'll be all right.
-it's nothing.
We'll get you to port.
The wind is blowing the wrong way.
Like politicians, very unpredictable.
Don't talk.
My men need someone like you.
Someone who keeps his course.
You can do it.
Michiel.
Go and help people.
Are you all right?
-Yes. This morning you also...
-I'm fine.
The new prime minister of Holland and West Friesland.
The right honourable lord Johan de Witt.
Thank you.
As regent of the Prince of Orange... I think I speak on behalf of all members... when I say we're glad with our new chairman from mighty Holland.
Some would say relieved.
I, for one, will sleep better now we have a man at the helm... who'll serve the interests of all the provinces. And not just those of his republican friends.
I presume lord Kievit can rise above the parties.
I was thinking of the Prince of Orange.
How can the Prince rise above the parties... when he doesn't even reach my belt?
Order.
We will hear the honourable De Witt.
First, I'm very happy that lord Kievit is sleeping well.
To answer your question:
I understand your concerns.
I do. There is no one in this country who understands you more than I do.
My father was imprisoned for disagreeing with the Orangists.
I found out what it means to live in a country... where you cannot say what you are thinking.
Do you want to live in such a country?
I don't. I don't think you do, either.
Let me pose you a question.
We're a nation of merchants.
We sail the seas of the world with 20,000 ships. In trade, we all work together.
To get better prices and to help each other.
And what do you think?
Does this work or not?
It does. Some members became so successful they hardly fit in the benches.
When you do business in the East or the West... do you do so as Orangists or as republicans?
And why are the English trying to block our shipping routes?
To disrupt trade.
Is that because you're an Orangist or a republican?
No, the English want to wage war against us, because we're Dutch.
Free Dutchmen.
Large monarchies consider our small nation too rich. Too successful and too free.
On top of that, we're a republic. In which all men are free to live their own lives. We decide how we worship God.
No leader is more important than the country itself.
The English begrudge us our freedom. Our freedom frightens them. Because we're prepared to die for our freedom.
Because we paid for our freedom with our own blood.
And I'm asking you:
Haven't you all lost a relative to the Spanish or the English?
And was that republican blood or Orangist blood?
No. It was Dutch blood.
It's our blood.
This is our country. A country we conquered from the water. A country where we earn our own happiness.
Our freedom can only be protected if we are willing to fight for freedom for others.
That is why the Dutch lion holds these seven arrows in his claw.
That is what binds us.
Your freedom is my freedom.
I'll defend this freedom until my last breath.
Hear, hear.
Gentlemen.
Welcome home.
-Lord mayor.
Leave it, Neeltje. I can do it myself.
I said...
Sorry, I look awful.
Why aren't you in bed?
-I'm feeling better.
How long will you be staying?
-For as long as you like.
Honestly?
I've told them to find someone else.
What about the English?
They don't pay enough.
The English will be quiet for a while.
I want to get on with our lives.
We can finally extend the vegetable garden.
Great... As much as you like.
I'm glad I ordered an extra cask of beer.
All those lost years.
You were on your own because I was away.
Was it a boy or a girl? -A girl.
I'm staying with you now.
I won't abandon you anymore.
Good morning.
-Slow down.
Daddy. -Sleepyhead.
We're awake now.
-I couldn't stop them.
You stink.
-Yes, of seaweed.
Do I need a bath?
-There is a letter for you, daddy.
What kind of letter?
-Come with us.
Go ahead.
Hello, son.
There was a messenger.
He had a fat horse.
-He came from The Hague.
Open it.
-Michiel.
We're not aboard a ship.
Look, it has a little hole.
10 copies from this one.
Tromp?
Mr De Ruyter?
This way, please.
Mr De Ruyter, I've heard so many good things about you.
Really?
-You're the man to lead our fleet.
You mean with Cornelis Tromp?
-No, under me.
And not under Tromp?
-No. I want you, only you.
As admiral?
We need to rebuild and modernize our fleet.
I haven't served long enough.
You have more experience than any other.
-As a sailor. No one will listen to me.
-We'll make them listen.
I'm not of noble birth.
-Even better.
Sailors are conservative.
You can't just make anyone admiral of the fleet.
That's not how it works.
-Yes, it does. It's the 17th century, anything is possible.
-This is ridiculous.
You were raised as an Orangist.
Most men in Zeeland were.
-I'm not into politics.
But that is an advantage, sailors have to trust their admiral.
De Ruyter, this is in our nations interest.
I'm not setting sail again.
In the last 15 years, I've spent six months at home.
You have to find someone else.
Are you serious?
-Didn't I make myself clear?
I won't find a better man than you.
-Of course you will.
This is the 17th century, anything is possible.
Gentlemen.
What a strange fellow. What a strange fellow.
I guess we'll make Sir Obdam admiral.
Damn it, admiral, what must we do?
Retreat.
Keep that head in the wind.
We've lost 25 ships.
3000 dead and 2000 men taken prisoner by the English.
Good men, who fought for their country.
Honest men.
Who trusted the prime minister.
-Hear, hear.
Who trusted him with their lives.
Order.
-Do you think this will be the end of it?
Is that honestly what you think?
I'll tell you who is to blame.
That prime minister from Holland.
And his republican friends.
They should send him out to sea.
-This isn't your fault.
The Spanish want our trade routes, the Germans want to control our rivers. And the French can't wait to occupy the Southern Netherlands.
What are we going to do?
Just go.
I made you a promise.
There is no use staying home if there is no home left.
Engel, come on.
We need a strong leader who is respected by other kingdoms.
What do we do about it?
-The Prince of Orange... is nothing but a brat.
A brat. Are we sure that the Prince is a real man?
I've been told he prefers ballet over military strategy.
Order, order.
-Gentlemen.
Let's keep it somewhat civilised.
What do you propose, regent Kievit?
I propose we appoint the honourable lord Cornelis Tromp... son of our greatest naval hero ever, as our new admiral.
Mr de Witt?
-Mr Tromp. Do we have an appointment? -No, we don't.
I thought I'd speed things up.
Since your father's funeral I haven't had a chance...
You're looking for someone to replace my father.
I'm looking into it.
-You probably don't realize... but the fleet will only accept one man as their new admiral.
And who is that?
My blood is his blood. The blood of Bestevaer.
You might not understand.
I understand the admiral was a father figure to his men.
But Bestevaer is a title of respect.
You have to earn it, it's not hereditary.
I'm afraid it is, Mr de Witt.
Heroes father heroes, that's how sailors see it. And that, Mr de Witt, will never change.
You're still thinking about De Ruyter?
Why not invite him to dinner?
Johan, he's stubborn.
-invite his wife too, this time.
Mr. and Mrs. De Ruyter, welcome.
Come in.
Was it a long trip, De Ruyter?
From Vlissingen to The Hague.
Of course.
-Darling, don't just stand there. Won't you offer our guests a drink?
-Yes.
You didn't tell me they have a baby.
-My wife, Wendela.
What a cutie.
Excuse me. -What for?
She is a cutie.
I'll show you round the house.
Wine?
Or do sailors only drink beer?
Girls. Why don't you show us around?
We need larger ships with more cannons.
Larger ships, fine.
They must be agile and have a shallow draught.
Merchant ships are of no use to me.
I'll arrange it.
What else? -Better pay for the crew.
Higher wages?
If they die, they leave a family behind.
Consider it done.
Doesn't the parliament have to approve, first?
Leave that to me.
Each winter, the fleet lies at anchor.
It's a waste of time.
I agree.
If I were admiral, I'd train the crew in winter.
Exactly.
And that costs money, too.
Carry on. What else?
-The sea-battles?
In battle now, it's every ship for itself.
It's total chaos.
Organisation is key.
-You mentioned sign flags in the past.
The English have been using them for years. But their system is too limited.
The ladies are chatting. Mr prime minister? Allow me to introduce my brother, Cornelis.
Tell us about the system we developed.
-Our system? I happen to have it right here.
We disagreed about the colours.
Johan felt we were using too much orange.
-A bit too much.
So, what do you say, De Ruyter?
Are you going to do this job?
Or do you have more demands?
I, Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter...
The English have a limited flag system.
We're expanding our flag system with all these codes. ...swear allegiance to the Republic of the United Netherlands. And then change the signal.
Only these 6 bow cannons are a problem.
We tack as fast as we can and then...
We fire everything we have on the port side on these ships here.
Fire.
Cool and reload. Come on.
And?
-We're here.
Wait.
Do you really think I look all right?
-You're the Prince of Orange.
All of the Netherlands loves you.
Huzzah, huzzah, huzzah.
Your Highness.
-Prime minister.
May I introduce gentlemen De Witt, Tromp and our new admiral?
Admiral De Ruyter, our great sea hero.
You can't imagine how glad I am to meet you.
I want to hear all about your travels to Africa and your escape from France.
This is my wife, Anna.
-Your Highness.
Fascinating.
Fascinating.
I promise to do my utmost to truly follow... the instructions and orders... in regards to my position as admiral - the Supreme Commander of the Fleet.
You're very brave to be here Your Highness, surrounded by these republicans.
The English fleet has set sail.
-Four squadrons.
They're blocking our merchant ships.
We have to take action before our goods are lost.
One, two, all together... One, two, all together... One, two, all together...
Work those ropes.
Get that wind in the sails.
Render those ropes further.
Come on.
One, two, all together...
If the wind turns, the rear squadron sails around them.
So I have to keep an eye on your flags while I'm surrounded by flying canon balls?
Just give me an extra 150 men.
-No, it'll be chaos.
The English have more ships, bigger guns.
We stick to the plan. Or do we want another defeat like Lowestoft?
We must make sure we're well-organised.
Good, we'll do it your way. You stubborn Zeelander.
Are you prepared to die for the fatherland?
To the fatherland.
Wonderful.
God bless you.
-Half a turn to port. Half a turn to port.
What's going on?
-Gout.
Am I in the way?
-Not at all. A perfect target for the English.
The Royal Charles. Unsinkable, or so they say.
All ships are unsinkable, Jan.
Until they sink.
Signal: In line.
-You mean this one, sir?
Put it up.
It's impressive.
-You'll see, it'll be every ship for itself.
Captain.
-Yes, sir.
Vanguard closer to the wind.
-Vanguard, luff up.
Load starboard.
-Load starboard. Do you want me to call your mother?
Get to work.
Faster.
-Faster.
Mainsail halyard.
Come on, load. Faster.
Faster. -Keep it in the wind.
Brace yourselves.
Wait.
Everybody wait.
Jibs forward.
-Luff up.
Wait.
Attention.
Admiral?
Trim the lines.
Fire.
Let him be.
Get back.
Keep firing.
Pull up the mizzen sail. Luff up.
Come on, get going.
-Come on.
They need to reload faster.
Come on.
You're too slow.
-Why is it taking so long?
Faster, or you're going overboard.
Speed it up. Come on, boy.
I need to shit.
-No shitting.
Reload the cannon.
You can have that shit later.
Come on. Reload the cannons.
Reload like lightning.
Come on, reload.
Get back to work.
Get back to that cannon.
Are you sleeping or what?
Captain, how is the rear?
The English are on lee side.
-Middle squadron luff up.
Gijs, middle squadron luff up.
Hold the lines.
-Get that wind in the sails.
Port.
Reload the cannons, starboard, port.
Look, that Englishman is mine.
Two points port.
-We need to stay in line.
Two points port.
-But the signal from De Ruyter.
All right, come about.
Come about. Brace the sails.
Load port cannons.
Cover. Fire.
Keep that head in the wind.
De Ruyter's strategy is not going to work.
And we're the ones under fire.
Load port cannons.
What are you doing?
Get in position.
Load port cannons.
Grappling hooks.
A portion of rum for the man who puts the most English to the sword.
Come on.
I can make this a lot easier for you. All you have to do, is tell the truth.
You were part of a conspiracy to assassinate the Prince of Orange.
There are witnesses.
I don't see how you want to deny...
-Yes, that's highly unfortunate.
I can't turn this into more than an exile.
I assume you don't want to end up here yourself.
Do you want a hug from De Witt?
Victory is ours.
A cheer for Tromp.
A cheer for Piet's cannons.
A cheer for our captain.
And three cheers for our admiral.
Can His Highness receive me?
-Certainly.
Your Highness, lord Kievit.
Our fleet has given the English a beating.
So De Ruyter is as good as they say. Quite a victory for Johan de Witt.
-For the Netherlands.
Gentlemen?
-Of course.
While I stand by doing nothing.
All my relatives and friends are kings or important people.
Even those Habsburger simpletons, with their in-bred minds.
Why doesn't anyone take the Prince of Orange seriously?
You can play a decisive role. If I may be so bold.
You're the cousin of the English king.
So, 7200, 8400, 10,800 amounts to a total of 5.14 percent.
As I was saying, we can calculate average life expectancy. And adapt the price of annuities.
If my calculations are correct...
-They are.
Indeed they are.
The 7.14 percent the State is paying out now, is far too high.
So, we can save a lot of money. Money the State can use to build more ships.
But, must people die earlier or later to make this work?
Exactly, it's not clear. It's not clear.
I'll explain one more time what the percentages mean.
Why earlier?
-Gentlemen, please excuse us.
Didn't you say you could explain it to a child?
The English have sailed again, sir.
De Ruyter will have to get ready.
-Sounds like a good idea.
Thanks, guys.
That goes in the kitchen, and that one. And that one goes to the study.
Are you sure?
-Yes.
Need a hand?
-Michiel.
Aren't you sailing tomorrow?
-Yes, with the first tide.
I thought we'd have dinner together.
-Daddy.
I have my own room.
-You live here too?
We have our own box bed.
-Go ahead, I'll be right in.
The admiralty suggested a larger house, but this is near the harbour.
As long as you live here. Dad, are you coming?
Dad, this is our bed.
-Look at that.
No boots in bed.
You sound just like your mother.
What are you doing?
VOC?
Can I have a look?
-Go ahead.
Flooded cellar?
-I'll take the supplier off my list.
Don't bother.
-What?
You can't do this. I've supplied the fleet for years.
Why do we get the worst grain?
Or do you supply this muck to the VOC too?
Is there a problem?
You don't get better grain for your republican pals.
Who does he think he is?
We'll find someone else.
What? -That was the third one.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because you're busy saving the country.
Come and join me.
Are you all right?
Leave me, I want to be alone.
Faster, guys.
-Come about.
Keep it tight.
What are they doing?
-Gijs.
They try to cut us off.
Take the signals to the front now.
Tack over port.
-Ready to come about.
Full about now.
Get to work on the lower decks.
Keep it UP-
Follow those two ships there. -We'll break the line, Tromp.
Sod off with your line, those ships are mine.
Four points to starboard.
-Michiel ordered it.
Who is the highest ranking officer?
Come about.
Four points to starboard.
Come about.
Where is Tromp?
-He has broken line.
Cannons ready?
Fire.
Damn it.
Michiel, they're surrounding us.
-Where is Tromp?
I'm sorry, admiral.
-Lie still, don't move.
Admiral?
It doesn't hurt at all.
You're the rock on which I build, the future awaiting me, my highest good.
Seventeen killed on the gunners' deck.
All of them brought up.
You're the rock on which I build, the future awaiting me, my highest good.
Hang in there.
I've lost twenty ships.
Who was in command?
-I gave you an order.
So court-martial me.
-Get back into that longboat.
Don't set foot on my ship or on any other ship in this fleet, ever again.
You are relieved of your duties as of now, so piss off.
Leave it to the court-martial.
-You disgrace the name of Tromp.
Leave my father out of this.
He'd be ashamed of you.
Michiel, you can't do this.
You want to be dishonourably discharged as well?
Come on, back to work.
Get down there and pick up those cannons.
Master Buat is a loyal rittmeister. You're executing such a loyal servant?
Who is he serving?
He went to the king of England behind my back.
In the national interest.
-Your interest.
I've seen enough.
I shouldn't have lost my temper with Tromp.
He is the vice-admiral, after all.
-He deserved it.
Stay down or I'll put this you know where.
It's just a cold.
-Malaria.
Where is the patient?
-Upstairs.
De Ruyter?
-That's Johan.
Do what you have to do.
We haven't heard anything from the English.
-They've run out of money.
So why won't they negotiate peace?
They hope we're afraid of the French.
We can't afford two wars.
The French? Are they a real threat?
-No, but the Orangists are. They say I'm too weak to force a peace treaty.
You must force the English to their knees.
You have a plan.
It's not without risk.
You know the English fleet is in Chatham.
With the right wind it's only a two day sail inland.
You want to sail up the Medway?
Is it crazy?
Would nobody do it?
Sail through their chains?
You must be desperate.
-I know it's a lot to ask for.
Not now, get out of here.
-Sorry, dad.
What about those sea soldiers you're training?
What do you call them?
-Marines.
Is this a good time to test them?
It's a bad time.
Not even men like that can be asked to...
Forget about it, it's a silly plan.
Really silly.
Which one do you want?
That one?
Thank you.
-Bye.
Hi, darling.
-Dad's up.
What are you doing?
Try to understand. If I don't go...
-Where are you going?
Can't you tell me?
That's a first.
The Lord bless you and keep you.
The Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you.
The Lord turn his face toward you... and give you peace.
-Amen.
Thank you, my thoughts are with admiral De Ruyter.
Thank you.
For my husband.
I don't know...
-You know where they are.
For my husband.
-For my son.
Where is Michiel?
These women have no idea where their husbands are.
Johan must know.
Johan, I'm sorry to disturb you.
Anna is here.
Where is the fleet?
Where is Michiel?
I don't know. I can't reach them.
Tell her that yourself.
Come on in.
They're on the Medway.
-Heading for London?
It's time.
Gentlemen, the people are counting on you.
Over to you.
Men, into the longboats.
Down.
Up.
Forward.
Those brothers De Witt.
Watch out.
Keep that head in the wind.
It's a shame to burn that one.
Members of the State, I present to you... the stern carving of the Royal Charles.
You didn't expect that one, eh?
Charles ll has accepted our terms.
The peace treaty will be signed in Breda.
Van Ginneken, let me embrace you.
I can't do it.
Delicious. It looks fantastic.
Well.
To peace.
-We've already toasted to that.
To us.
-That's much better.
To us.
Can we go and play now?
-Yes, go and play. Quickly now.
Be careful.
Not too fast.
What? Should I have proposed a toast to the Prince?
This peace won't last.
-it's politics. One day at a time.
Michiel is worried about the French.
-You mean you are.
So, everything is fine?
The French are building up their troops.
Rumours.
-Persistent rumours.
So you want to expand the army? -We should have done that already.
The army is full of Orangists.
How many batallions will you give the Prince?
You're asking for a civil war.
-Cornelis means...
I think I know what he means.
Damn it.
Idiot.
Can't we just enjoy ourselves for once?
We're at peace with the English.
The republicans hold a stable majority.
In the meeting hall. -Useless when the French invade.
They never will.
-The people are scared.
That's silly of them.
-it's all my men talk about, too.
Diplomacy, Michiel, diplomacy is the future of warfare.
The people don't understand diplomacy.
I can't adapt my policy to people who understand less than we do.
Come on, gentlemen, we're having a party.
I'm going to dance with my fantastic wife.
You heard the man, we're having a party.
Mr Chairman... they say that Louis is gathering 100,000 troops.
They say, they say...
Who says so?
Who?
Mr Van Ginneken has it easy with his district behind the defence lines.
Order.
Mr Chairman... we've been paying huge taxes. And what are we getting in return?
Give up the south and perhaps Louis will levy less taxes.
Would you say that to my face?
-I certainly would.
I'll repeat it to your face:
Give up the south.
Order, order.
Gentlemen.
Louis can mass all the troops he wants, but he can't attack us.
He'll face the Swedes and the English.
We have it in black and white.
What if Charles breaks his word?
-We are on good terms with England.
Right honourable member Kievit...
I hope you're not suffering from sleepless nights?
I'd sleep better if the Prince were king.
Only then we know for sure that Charles won't betray us.
You're responsible for the civil war in this country. You, Mr De Witt.
Damn you.
The French are in Maastricht with 100,000 soldiers.
And Louis XIV is there himself.
-Not bad for us.
Not bad for us?
What do you mean?
Do you realise what is about to happen?
Your Highness can save the country. And become supreme commander.
-And king.
Charles has forged a deal with Louis.
-Charles has agreed not to interfere.
Don't you get it?
And you don't get it either?
You don't get it either.
Do you think Charles would give our country to Louis?
The English will invade Holland.
Go on, I'll finish this.
Have you heard the news?
And that's not all.
The bishops of Cologne and Münster are joining in.
They've divided our country, everyone gets a piece of the pie.
It's not just about destroying our fleet.
They want to land near The Hague with a huge number of troops.
You must stop them. Our land army won't survive it.
You're our only hope, Michiel.
Don't let them turn us into English and French provinces.
Has it got worse again?
-I could do with some fresh air.
It's better you stay with him.
Thank you.
I should never have weakened our army.
If only I had fixed this earlier.
This country has been blessed to have you.
No one could've predicted this.
To the admiralty.
Go on. -Long live the prime minister.
What was that?
You did not cheer for our Prince?
Are you on Charles II's pay roll?
Do you work for the English?
I suggest you leave this sailor alone. We'll be needing him.
Get lost.
Aren't you brave?
Losers.
You're going back to Vlissingen.
-No, I'm staying here.
You're so stubborn.
-Look who's talking.
Engel, get inside.
I can do this myself.
I'll take care of him, you take the girls to Vlissingen.
Who says it's safer there?
They think we're traitors who work for the republicans.
Eat your vegetables.
I could hardly get through.
-Eat up before it gets cold.
There are more and more of them.
Why are those people so angry?
-Because they're afraid.
First, they betrayed us... to the English and now to the French.
And De Ruyter is part of it, too.
If he wanted, he could have chased them off.
I've heard that he's keeping our ships in the harbour.
And that Louis will make the admiral the Duke of Brabant.
The prime minister has weakened the army... so De Ruyter has all the power.
Downstairs, now.
Hide.
Mummy, hurry up.
Come on.
Stay there.
Let's burn his house down.
Fire.
Go back. Go on. Just sit there.
Here's a blanket, madam.
Be careful.
Don't you have anything better to do?
Go back to your families.
-Your husband betrayed us.
Betrayed you?
Really?
So what did my husband do when the English attacked us at Plymouth?
And Ter Heijde, and Bergen and Chatham'?
Did he betray you then?
Or did my husband save you and your families?
I understand that you're afraid. I'm afraid, too.
So go home and let Michiel do what he always does.
Risking his life so that all of you can sleep safely.
He tried to murder the Prince, together with De Witt.
Don't leave, mommy.
It'll be all right.
-I'm afraid.
Long live France.
You don't have a plan, admit it. -Mr De Waerd.
Cut it out. Stop delaying things.
There is no time for political games.
-It isn't a political game.
Representative De Waerd has the floor.
The situation is untenable.
The only person who can save us, is the Prince.
The prime minister should hand in his resignation. Immediately.
They're waiting, Your Highness.
It took them such a long time. Let them wait.
I say we appoint Tromp as the new admiral.
-Someone we can trust.
Since when can't I trust De Ruyter?
But, Your Highness, he's friends with De Witt.
Please try to understand, Kievit, we have to work together.
I want to be the leader for all Dutchmen.
Your Highness, it's an honor and pleasure to ask you... on behalf of the Dutch Republic to accept the title of king... like your ancestor, William of Orange, once was.
There is one thing I'm really concerned about.
Yes, we have received some very worrying news. Concerning a secret plot to assassinate the Prince.
We also know who's behind it.
Come on.
I can make this a lot easier for you. All you have to do, is tell the truth.
You were part of a conspiracy to assassinate the Prince of Orange.
There are witnesses.
I don't see how you want to deny...
-Yes, that's highly unfortunate.
I can't turn this into more than an exile.
I assume you don't want to end up here yourself.
I think you should read this.
Cornelis is accused of high treason for plotting to kill the Prince.
Johan asks me to testify.
-Don't be stupid.
You heard me.
-The brothers De Witt are lost.
Stay out of it.
-What kind of country would that be?
I say whatever I want, as long as I live.
Back to shore, straight away.
Hoist the sails.
We have to get his brother here as well.
Say that this comes from Cornelis.
-I don't know if I...
We're going to be in power soon.
We need to know who is with us and who is not.
There must be some kind of procedure.
-That depends on... A message for you.
Excuse me.
-Something must be done.
Come on.
Stand aside.
Move. Open up.
It's okay. It's me.
You shouldn't have come.
It's a trap.
Admit it. You can't do without me.
We have to get out of here.
Can you walk? I've got you.
And you don't know where he went?
-No, sir, I don't.
Traitor.
Do it.
There is De Ruyter.
He's friends with the De Witts. Get him.
Get him.
The heart of the prime minister.
I thought you were at sea.
-Daddy.
Where have you been?
-The Hague.
Bring the children to bed.
-Come, children.
Daddy's tired. Go on.
Bye,daddy.
What happened?
-I was too late. I...
Johan".
Gentlemen, look. Cornelis De Witt's penis.
Five cents.
Piss off, man.
Barbaric.
It had to be done.
They would've tried to seize power again.
We have to know who we can trust.
We can't allow for Tromp to serve under De Ruyter.
I want to serve, but not under De Ruyter.
De Ruyter stays.
I've appointed him for life, and I'm a man of my word.
Make it up with him.
Old Tromp whispered something to me before he died. About the way the wind blows, and that an admiral has to keep his course.
I thought he was talking nonsense, but now I understand.
Politics.
Only one thing counts for an admiral.
I've heard enough.
You're going to do what they ask of you.
Go.
Try to understand.
-They almost killed us too.
I know.
Promise me one thing. When all of this is over, we go back to Vlissingen.
You, me, the children.
The army needs reinforcements here.
The cities along the Ijssel have surrendered to the French.
Let's turn the navy into land forces.
Where can we cut the dikes?
Your Highness, do you realize what the consequences will be?
Are you sure?
Thousands of people live there.
All civilians, Your Highness.
-I want the exact locations.
Leave us.
You stay here.
Admiral.
Your Highness.
I congratulate you on your appointment.
I know how you feel, De Ruyter.
The French are nearing Amsterdam.
The English will attack, with the help of the French fleet.
You have to make up with Tromp.
The country needs you. Both of you.
I will follow your orders.
I'm sure you will.
You have my word.
Well clone.
Gentlemen, excuse me, we're going to flood the country.
Huzzah for De Ruyter and Tromp.
Let's not overdo it.
Let's get to work.
Welcome, admiral.
The English receive help from the French fleet.
You've already started.
According to the latest updates they're here and here.
Not only do they want to destroy our ships, but go ashore as well.
The English want an invasion. That's to our advantage.
They want to reach the coast, so they'll try to go ashore here or here.
The wind comes from the south, and so we'll do what they expect us to do.
We're going to sail in line here... and then Tromp is going to leave a hole here. He's good at that.
You want them to sail through.
-The tide could be in our advantage.
It's our only chance.
Brilliant.
My head is like an old piss bucket.
Can someone tell me what the plan is?
Girls, you're going with Klaartje.
You can't go to the coast by yourself.
Not through the front door.
Through the back.
Hoist the sails. Pull the ropes.
Keep going.
They're taking the bait.
Come on.
We're going through that hole there.
It's our chance to reach the coast.
Man the guns.
Hurry up, prepare the cannons.
For once I do what you say...
-Admiral. The French fleet arrived.
Take the Vooruitgang.
You know the plan.
Aye aye, admiral.
Boatswains in front of the mast.
Prepare to come about.
Get ready.
De Ruyter is trying to defend the coast. Let's go.
Damn it.
Abandon ship.
Let us come about then.
Load starboard.
Prepare to come about.
Come about.
Prepare to come about.
Every ship should pull back.
Lift those cannons. Up.
Carpenters, to the front.
Fire.
Pull back.
Pull back.
To victory.
Huzzah for De Ruyter.
Bestevaer.
Bestevaer.
You know what you promised.
-Just one more talk and it's over.
People are being arrested everywhere.
Don't say anything foolish to the Prince.
There are some people here I want to introduce you to.
These gentleman represent about a quarter of our army.
You want me to join a rebellion?
You can be the symbol of our resistance.
The people look up to you.
And I have the fleet behind me.
You're crazy, man.
Plunge the country into a civil war?
Anything is better than a dictatorship.
A disgrace. This is a total disgrace.
Be careful, Michiel. Trust no one.
Look around you.
That just gives them a reason to arrest you.
We have to show that we can work together.
We must rebuild this country together.
The republicans are reorganizing.
-They want De Ruyter as their leader.
The people love him.
-That's the problem, Your Highness.
We have a plan to solve that problem.
The Prince of Orange.
Thank you.
I would like to thank one man... without whom this glorious victory would never have occurred.
The great hero from the Battle of Texel:
Cornelis Tromp.
They don't know what they're doing.
Bravo.
Do you have a moment?
I'll be right with you.
Retirement?
Back to Zeeland?
What will the Netherlands do without you?
This country has a great leader.
The country has a great leader.
How can I be a great leader for all the Dutch... if they don't all love me?
I'm not like him.
Your Highness is underestimating himself.
Are you serious?
The king can unite the country.
Rise above the parties. You want me to release the rebels.
-A nice gesture.
Have you heard what they say about me?
That's how they thank me, after everything I did for my people.
Surely you can admit that.
Should I just watch the republicans ruin our country?
I can't just stand idly by.
Like with Johan and Cornelis de Witt?
Was that massacre also for the good of the country?
I had nothing...
-Nothing to do with that?
We couldn't control the mob.
No one had any idea.
Your people incited the nation against the De Witts for months.
Pamphlets, agitators, filthy back room politics.
How dare you?
You'll have to live with your conscience.
How dare you?
Still De Witt's friend, eh?
I'm starting to doubt if you'll obey me when it's needed.
I have always served my country.
If only the country was as stable as you.
Your Highness can be assured of my dedication.
But am I?
Admiral.
I hoped this wouldn't be necessary, but my advisers were right. I'll accept your retirement on one condition.
Your Highness?
-You carry out one last mission.
You're going to the Mediterranean Sea. -A secret mission against the French.
Why should I?
It's not wise to refuse a direct order from your Prince.
It's hard to protect a traitor's family.
De Ruyter.
I might as well have condemned him to death. That would've been more honest.
Think of it as an act of a true statesman.
I've decided to form an alliance with the English throne.
I have to seize this opportunity. A marriage with Mary Stuart.
Think of it as an act of a true statesman.
I couldn't sleep either.
Why, Michiel?
Why did you accept that mission?
You have nothing to prove. They can't force us.
That's not it.
So you want a state funeral?
-I don't want to cause a civil war.
And you won't.
It's not your fault those men are in prison.
Someone has to obey the Prince.
The Prince?
He only wants to get rid of you.
They all want to get rid of you.
Your success is too great. Don't you see what they're doing?
They want you dead, just like with Johan.
Someone needs to lead by example.
-A good example.
Let someone else do it. They always reconcile.
Too much blood has been spilled.
The country is torn.
I don't care if the country is torn.
I just want us to enjoy our retirement in peace.
What do you mean?
What did the Prince say?
Did he threaten us?
So he did. -He wasn't even subtle about it.
And you want to risk your life again for a man like that?
A man who has never cared about other people... or what it's like for us and the children.
I do this for you and the children.
He guarantees your safety while I'm gone.
And if you survive and come back?
Will it be over then?
Will they leave us alone?
You're not coming back.
You're not leaving me alone, do you hear me?
You're not leaving me by myself.
Of course, darling. Of course I'm coming back.
No, no, no, no.
Be a good boy.
Raise up.
Smooth.
Daddy loves you very much.
Forgive me, my love.
Come on, let's go home.
I count no more than 12 ships.
Where is the Seven Provinces?
Is that all they have?
What's the honor in that?
Prepare for combat.
-Get ready.
Load the cannons.
Fire.
Reload the cannons.
Hurry up with those cannons.
God damn it.
Faster, faster.
Fire.
Stay with us.
Slightly more to port.
Anna.
Michiel de Ruyter is dead.
Load the cannons with blank shells. Let's honor our enemy.
Get ready to pay tribute.
Look at them.
Orangists and republicans, side by side for the first time.
I never could have done that.
I've seen enough.
The end of an era.
That is Anna De Ruyter, let her through.
Give him the most beautiful grave possible.
All right.
Heidi!
Come on!
Hello, Dete.
I'm hot.
Is it far?
- Heidi, it's right at the top.
Hello, Dete.
Hello.
Is that your late sister's daughter?
- Yes.
Come on, Heidi. We have to go.
- She's got so big.
Come on.
Where are you taking her?
To her grandfather.
- To the Alp-Uncle?
Good heavens!
Dete.
He's godless and hates every living soul.
They say he even forgot how to speak.
Am I meant to put her in a home?
Or give her to some farmer we don't know?
You know that nobody wants an extra mouth to feed.
She might have been better off with strangers.
He even fell out with his own son. May God rest his soul.
And I'm sure he won't want anything to do with the child.
Heidi!
Where are you?
Heidi, come here right now!
Coming!
Hello, Grandfather.
Hello, Alp-Uncle.
This is Heidi.
Your grandchild.
I've found a position in Frankfurt.
So now I'm bringing her to you.
She's your own flesh and blood affer all.
Go!
And take her with you.
I've looked affer her for five years.
But I can't do it anymore.
- Get out of here!
Heidi, listen to me.
There's nothing to be scared of. I'm sure Uncle won't hurt you.
Right, now go.
Go!
God forgive me.
The child!
Take the child with you!
Go on, go with her!
But she doesn't want me either.
Grandfather?
Good morning, Grandfather.
Drink.
Thank you.
- I'll take you to the parson.
He'll know what to do with you.
Open up.
The child is strong. And healthy.
She won't be much trouble.
She can't stay with me.
Okay, fine.
I'm going to Maienfeld in three days. Maybe a farmer has a use for her.
Otherwise, it's a home.
But she has to stay with you until then.
I'll bring her down then.
It's your Christian duty to look affer your grandchild.
Here, off you go.
Grandfather?
Should I sleep in the stable again tonight?
Sleep wherever you want.
You only have one chair.
And only one bed.
What's that up there?
I want to sleep up here in the hay. Am I allowed?
Grandfather?
I'd rather not go into a home.
Good morning, Grandfather.
- Drink your milk.
Stop there!
Good morning, goats.
Little Bear!
Little Swan!
Come on!
Come on!
Chop chop!
Good day, General Goatherd.
Take the girl with you out on the alp today.
She doesn't know how things work in the mountains.
Hello. My name is Heidi.
Right.
- Thank you.
Come on.
Did you hear him?
You have to do what I say.
Yeah, yeah.
What's your name?
- Peter.
Are you living with him now?
- Yes, he's my grandfather.
Your grandfather?
Why don't you live with your parents?
Because they're dead.
My father is dead too.
I was living with my Aunt Dete in Bad Ragaz until now.
I had to sit inside all day.
But here is much better. I can be outside!
Hey, stay with me!
- Yeah, yeah.
What's that little one called?
Snowhopper.
- Will you show me how to make a fire?
Sure.
Hey, Peter.
Did you eat some of my cheese and sausage?
What, me?
No, that wasn't me.
Who else could it have been?
I don't know. Maybe a goat?
A goat?
Hey!
Stay there.
Little Swan, Thistlefinch!
Stop it, stop!
Get away!
Stop that!
Just you wait!
- Leave him!
Do you never listen?
I said stay over there!
Stop hitting them!
They stopped fighting.
They need to be punished. They give less milk if they fight.
If you stop hitting them, I'll give you half my food.
Half of it?
Every day?
But you're not allowed to hit the goats anymore.
Do you promise?
Every day.
Half.
Do you see?
Look.
- I can see.
Look. Ouick, get down!
Now your turn.
Me?
- Yes.
Heidi?
- Yes?
Maybe don't mention the food.
- I won't say anything.
In the village they say he killed someone once.
Thank you.
I'd rather sleep in the stable affer all.
Did Peter tell you stories about me?
And you just believe him?
Is it true what he says?
People like saying nasty things.
You have to decide whether to trust your own eyes and ears or what other people say.
Goodnight, Grandfather.
Lovely.
I know my way around up here.
I'll show you tomorrow where the edelweiss grows.
Peter.
I'll be gone tomorrow. Grandfather is taking me to the parson.
What?
I'm on my own with these stupid goats again.
Shoo!
Move!
Come on.
Go!
Move it!
What on earth do you look like?
Grandfather?
Is the chair for me?
Who else?
But I'm leaving tomorrow.
You're going out on the alp tomorrow.
And the next day too?
Certainly.
Don't ask so many questions and go and wash your face.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Peter!
I'm allowed to stay!
Today is the last day I'll be here.
- Why?
I have to go to school.
When are you coming back?
In the spring, I think.
Not until the spring?
You can come down and visit.
Grandmother will be pleased to see you.
No more eating, you've had enough!
Come on!
May I go to school too?
Come on, eat.
Look who's there.
That's unbelievable.
He shouldn't be allowed to take care of a child.
Good day.
Hello.
What do you have planned for the girl?
That's nothing to do with you.
In a year she'll have to go to school.
She doesn't have to do anything.
Be sensible. Every child must learn to read.
She can't come down from the alp on her own in the winter.
Come on, child. You go outside.
Alone the whole winter, up on that alp. A child of that age needs friends.
- She has all she needs.
It's against the law.
I'm not interested in your laws.
Come on.
Such a pig-headed fellow.
Here, look.
It's finished.
Beautiful.
Thank you, Grandfather.
If only it were spring again.
Faster!
Thank you.
When it gets dark, I'll come and pick you up.
Hello, is Peter there?
He's at school. But come inside.
Mother, we have a visitor. It's Heidi.
Hello.
Child, she can't see.
Come a little closer, Heidi.
Can you see nothing, Grandmother?
With my eyes, nothing at all. But with my hands, it's different.
Heidi!
- Peter!
Thank you.
You're not missing anything. School is so boring.
You just say that because you still can't read.
You can't either.
What good does reading do up here?
Eat your food!
You can have mine, Grandmother.
Thank you, Heidi, but it's too hard.
I hardly have any teeth leff, you know.
Then I'll take it.
Grandmother can't see. Did you know?
And she can't eat any stale bread at all.
We're lucky, aren't we Grandfather?
Uncle? Hello.
I've got some good news.
I've found a place for Heidi, with friends of my employers, in Frankfurt.
It's a well-respected family, and Heidi could even go to school with their young daughter.
It's a wonderful chance for her.
Say something at least!
When you're finished, you can go.
But I want to take her with me.
Heidi is staying here.
In the village they say you don't let her go to school.
Because of your obstinacy, she won't learn to read or write!
You want her to turn wild up here?
Why do you care about her all of a sudden?
Uncle, last time I had no other choice.
There's nothing more to say.
If you don't let her go to school, they'll take her away from you and put her in a home.
I'm taking her today. With help from the villagers, if needs be.
Where is the child?
Heidi is mine.
Now get out of here.
Heidi! - Dete?
Aunt Dete!
- Heidi, my child.
Come here.
Have you missed me lots?
Boy, go back to your goats.
I have to talk to Heidi. Come on.
Sit down.
Listen to me. How would you like to live in a big, beautiful house?
The Sesemanns, very kind people from Frankfurt, are looking for a friend for their daughter.
But I like it here.
But the girl in Frankfurt is so looking forward to you coming.
I'd rather stay with Grandfather.
Heidi, Grandfather wants you to come with me.
Really?
Child, we both just want what is best for you.
Come along. The train is leaving soon.
But I have to say goodbye.
- We don't have any time.
Is it far away?
- No, no.
And what if I don't like it?
Then you can come back home. I promise.
Come on.
Come on, hurry!
Where is Heidi?
Go, hurry!
Hop on.
Off we go!
- All right.
They've gone!
You're late again, aren't you?
Keep looking.
It's a miracle the child is still alive.
Heidi, stay here.
Stay here!
Heidi, come with me. Come inside.
Are you free?
The Sesemann mansion, please.
Come on.
Heidi!
Get out.
Good day, ladies.
- Good day.
Welcome, ladies.
Miss Rottenmeier is waiting for us.
Please follow me.
Heidi, stop it!
I'm introducing you to Miss Rottenmeier now, okay?
That's the young lady's governess.
Governess?
She's a very distinguished woman who looks affer Miss Klara.
So behave yourself!
Miss Rottenmeier will see you now. - Right.
Come along.
Unfortunately, I had no time to change her clothes.
What is your name?
- Heidi.
Heidi?
That's not a Christian name.
Her name is Adelheid, like her mother.
God rest her soul.
The child seems very young to me.
Indeed, she is quite small for her age.
I'm eight.
- Eight.
No, that won't do at all. Come with me, Dete.
Adelheid is exactly what Mr Sesemann wanted. An unspoiled child from the Swiss countryside.
And now I want my side of the deal.
What should I call you?
- Heidi.
I'm Klara.
Were you excited about Frankfurt?
Grandfather and Aunt Dete wanted me to come, but if I don't like it, I'm allowed to go back home.
You're the most curious girl I've ever met.
Are those boys' clothes?
It's practical on the alp. Especially for climbing.
Oh, climbing...
Can't you walk?
No, sadly not.
So you always have to sit in this?
- Yes.
Feel free to push me.
How do you like our house?
It's big.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
I rode into the table. I wasn't paying attention. I'm sorry.
Right.
It's time for supper.
Let's sit.
You look a bit like Peter the goatherd.
Pardon?
- Adelheid.
Don't talk like that to the servants.
In this house we use cutlery.
She doesn't even know the very basics.
Sorry. I'll get a rag. A rag?
Sit down, Adelheid!
Tinette. Silence!
Can I have two?
Sebastian.
"Can he please pass me two rolls?"
Can he please... give me two rolls?
"Pass me two rolls."
Pass me two rolls.
Two rolls.
Two rolls, please.
In this house there are rules, Adelheid.
You are to refer to the servants as 'he' or 'she', and conversing with them is forbidden.
Breakfast is at 7:30.
Lessons will take place in the study and commence at 8:15.
At 12:30 we take our lunch.
Then two hours of rest.
At 7 it's bed time.
In this house there is no running, hopping or jumping.
We always walk.
We never raise our voices.
Miss Rottenmeier?
What are you doing?
You can't run around here like that.
Me?
- Yes!
Don't people wash up in the mountains?
Yes, we do.
I have heard that up there, there are mountain trolls and gnomes.
Have you ever seen one?
Stay still.
Now put those on, and when you're ready, come upstairs.
Heidi!
No, the butter knife.
Okay, Miss Adelheid.
Open the book at chapter one and read aloud.
I can't.
Pardon?
I can't read.
You must know the letters.
Which letter is this?
It's like a mountain.
Yes, it is.
Miss Klara, this is not funny.
Peter can't read either.
Peter?
- Peter?
He's my friend.
Peter said we don't need to up on the alp.
You don't need to?
Miss...
Every person can and must learn to read.
Please excuse me one moment.
She doesn't know the alphabet?
A completely wild, uneducated creature has been brought into our house.
Maybe it would be appropriate for her to have a separate teacher.
You'd like that.
It can't be asking too much to teach the Swiss child the alphabet alongside Klara's lesson.
Certainly not, I just thought...
As soon as Mr Sesemann returns, I'll ensure Adelheid leaves this house.
Doesn't this window open?
Why?
I want to find out if you can see the mountains.
Miss Adelheid, would you be so kind as to retake your seat so that we can continue with the much-needed lesson?
Miss Klara.
Miss Adelheid, the mountain is called 'A'.
'A' for Adelheid.
' A'.
- Exactly.
Take me over there, Heidi.
Not so wide!
We don't want to be seen.
I wanted to show you this.
Is that you?
- And my mother.
But you're standing up.
Yes.
I only became ill affer...
Affer she died.
Father misses her too.
He's always travelling for his work.
And I'm always stuck in this house.
You!
Goodness me!
Young ladies don't creep up like that.
Sorry.
It's nap time, Miss Adelheid.
But I can't sleep.
You shouldn't sleep, just rest.
How can I be of service to the young lady?
Do you...
Does he know how to open the window?
Which one?
Here, mademoiselle.
Good gracious, not so far!
There are no mountains at all.
Well, you can't see any from up here, but look, you can see much further from the tower.
But now I have to close the window again and the young lady goes to her room. Otherwise there'll be trouble.
Thank you and adieu.
Adieu.
We have to be back before the affernoon rest is over.
Sure.
Right.
No, leff!
That's right. Along there.
Apples, fresh apples!
Fresh apples!
The tower.
Where is it now?
Heidi, I don't know right now.
Maybe he knows.
Heidi, you can't talk to a beggar!
Heidi!
This way.
There it is.
Bread!
Fresh bread!
Fresh bread!
There. That's where you go in.
What about you?
Don't worry about me. Go on, hurry!
Go!
I hope miss is well rested.
Miss?
I'm sure the young lady will like this.
How cute.
If you have a few pennies...
Don't just stand there. Search!
Miss?
Adelheid!
Klara!
I can't find them.
The front door was open.
And?
- Maybe they went out.
Oh, right. Why out?
Where?
I think we should look for them outside.
Good God!
Find the children, Sebastian.
Find them!
Where are the mountains?
Grandfather.
Heidi, how was it?
Look. They're so sweet.
We have to go.
Come on!
Miss!
What do you think you're doing?
Back to the house, quick as you can.
Where on earth were they?
Not far. They just wanted to...
Get some fresh air.
- Exactly.
You took Klara out of this house.
Are you aware of how dangerous that is?
What...
What would you have told her father if something had happened to her?
And your sash is all...
Oh, goodness!
Those creatures must go.
No...
- Sebastian!
Can't we keep them?
- Absolutely not!
I...
I can't breathe. The fur!
Oh God!
Get them away!
Those creatures must go!
Hurry up. Ouickly, Sebastian!
I'll look affer these little mites.
- I can't breathe.
Oh my god, take that one there!
Hurry up!
Sebastian!
Oh God.
Sebastian!
The cat!
It's attacking me!
No.
Adelheid will have no supper this evening.
But...
- Miss Sesemann. It is for adults to decide how children are brought up.
Stand over there.
With your face to the wall.
Get a move on!
With your face to the wall.
With your face to the wall, I said!
Next time I'll lock you in the cellar with the rats.
I have to go home.
Pardon me?
What?
Heidi!
I just have to.
But...
Adelheid.
- But why?
Heidi!
Stop right there.
Heidi, wait!
I said stop!
- Heidi!
Don't go!
How dare you!
Dete said I can leave when I want.
Did she really?
Then she lied. There's no way you're leaving.
Don't you know how lucky you are?
I wish I had grown up in such a house.
What did you want to do with those rolls?
They're for Grandmother.
You stupid child.
Leave them there.
Heidi, what are you doing?
Look what you're doing to the young lady.
Now go to your room.
Right this second.
Tinette.
Grandfather.
Where is Klara?
She's ill.
Sick!
Because of you.
So, here's our little Swiss girl.
Don't be scared. I'm just the doctor.
Hiya.
- Hiya?
Hiya.
Is Klara sick?
The young lady is much better.
I think she'll be pleased to see you.
Goodbye.
Adieu.
Am I so awful I make you want to leave?
No, that's not it.
I only have you, Heidi.
We could have such a nice time together.
'N'.
You should be a little faster by now. - 'O'.
It looks like a bread roll.
Exactly.
It's not a 'T' for tread, or a 'K' for kread, but a 'B'... A 'B' for bread.
And that starts with a...
'B'!
What's wrong with you?
How have you forgotten?
You've really dolled yourself up.
I haven't dolled myself up at all. How dare you!
Welcome home, sir.
- Sebastian.
My dear!
- Nice to have you here, Mrs Sesemann.
Father!
- Klara, my child.
My darling child!
- How wonderful, father.
Ah, so this is our Adelheid?
Good day.
I have a surprise for you.
Grandmama!
- Klara.
My sweet, sweet girl.
I'm only passing through, but I had to see you.
Let me look at you.
You look very well!
And...
Good day, medeme.
Madame.
Poppycock!
Just call me Grandmama.
We were right to find a friend for Klara.
She's much better, so cheerful.
I'm afraid my news will dampen your spirits somewhat.
In my opinion, Adelheid shows signs of... There's no other way for me to put it not being in her right mind.
Not in her right mind?
What do you mean?
- Adelheid still can't read.
She can't even recognise the letters, even though Mr Kandidat is doing the very best he can.
This is seriously disrupting Miss Klara's lessons.
And her behaviour is impossible, downright wild.
Well, well. I'm going to make up my own mind. And then we'll take it from there.
"When the young shepherd counted his sheep in the evening, he realised that the smallest one was missing."
"Where could it be?"
"Outside it began to snow and an icy wind blew."
That happened to me and Peter once.
We lost a goat.
Did you find it again? - Yes.
Thankfully.
There, where you come from... I'm sure it's very different to here. Am I right?
How does the story continue?
Please.
"It got darker and darker and the snowflakes whirled through the air."
"But all of a sudden he heard the very quiet bleating of a little sheep."
Right, that's where I'm stopping.
But the little sheep. Does he find it?
You can read that for yourself.
But I can't.
Why ever not?
Peter said we don't have to read.
Peter did, did he?
You don't always have to believe what other people say.
If you could read you would know how the story continues.
And you like stories, don't you?
Yes.
Well, then.
I'll leave the book there for you.
Heidi is a sweet and incredibly sensitive child.
I'm sure she can learn to read if given the right attention.
Thank goodness for that.
But I get the impression that she's not very happy.
She has all she could want.
It's something deep inside.
Living in this house goes against everything she is.
Klara has never been so happy.
I see.
And it stops you feeling guilty about leaving Klara alone.
Poppycock.
Hello?
Tinette.
What are you doing?
What's in your hand?
A ghost!
Don't you hear it?
There's no such thing as ghosts.
- There is!
Listen.
Sebastian?
Help!
A ghost!
Nothing was stolen?
I checked the silver myself three times over.
And I locked the door.
I promise.
It was a ghost, definitely.
Poppycock, Tinette. What rot!
Sebastian, you're a sensible man. You must have an explanation.
Well, I have to admit that if Sir is asking me, then it certainly has to be said that things are happening, that, well... that are somewhat, how shall I put it, that appear somewhat supernatural.
Supernatural?
- Yes.
Right, then.
Well...
I'm going to put a stop to all these carryings-on. Please make sure that the children hear nothing about this.
Goodnight.
To bed.
- Goodnight.
In... the... vall... ey...
"In the valley."
"In the valley, there flowed a small stream and in the clear water you could see the trout swimming."
Yes!
Heidi, I knew you could do it.
I knew it.
- Superb.
Who would have thought it?
"The fish glittered silver, and frolicked around playfully."
"Here at this lov... lovely place, the shepherd wanted to rest and eat his midday meal."
Yes, she can do it!
I'm so pleased, Grandmama.
- Bravo, bravo, Heidi!
Every child can learn to read with a good teacher and some patience.
Heidi, I'm delighted.
Our little Swiss girl seems to be doing well here.
And that's why... she should stay with us.
Forever?
- Yes.
Yes, my child, forever.
Goodbye, Mother.
- Goodbye.
How long can you stay, friend?
I'll leave as soon as this business is cleared up.
I hope to see the ghost for myself tonight.
It would be my first.
Child!
What on earth are you doing here?
Don't touch her!
You shouldn't wake sleepwalkers.
She's freezing cold.
Could you bring another blanket?
What on earth...
Here. Please leave us two alone.
Don't be scared, Heidi.
It's me, the doctor.
Were you dreaming?
About Grandfather.
Are you in any pain?
No, only here.
This hurts.
My dear child, why did you save all those bread rolls?
They're for Grandmother. She can't eat hard bread anymore.
You miss your home, little Heidi.
Come on.
There, there.
Everything will be okay.
Homesick, you say?
The Swiss illness.
Her nerves are in quite a state.
She must be sent home immediately.
She can't.
- She must!
I can't do that to Klara. Please.
Do all you can, okay?
I've given you my advice.
So?
Did you see the ghost?
I didn't say anything.
Tell me everything, Father. Please!
Klara.
The ghost... was our little Heidi.
Heidi?
- Heidi?
She sleepwalks because she's suffering.
What does she need?
- Her home.
So, my dear child, Heidi cannot stay here.
But she has to.
You can't do that!
Please don't!
What will I do without Heidi?
Heidi's illness will only be cured...
- I want her to stay here!
Klara.
- I'm sick and all alone too!
You're forgetting yourself.
Calm down this instant!
Just go!
Go to your grandfather and Peter. Everyone, just leave!
Tinette, take me to my room right away.
Adelheid.
Sebastian will take you home today.
You'll take the train at midday. Tinette will help you pack.
Home to Grandfather?
And Klara?
Klara?
Klara. Please open the door.
Thank you.
Can you give this to Klara?
She has to come and visit me. Please.
We'll see.
Peace again at last.
Tinette!
Tinette!
I'll call you Heidi.
My little Heidi.
Goodbye.
People live up there... Those mountains! It's so oppressive.
Come here.
It has been a great pleasure, miss.
Look affer the child well.
- I will.
Adieu!
Hey, look!
- What is it?
That's Heidi.
Hello, Heidi.
Come!
Nice!
I want that!
Look at these shoes.
Heidi!
- Peter!
Heidi, I heard you lived in a palace.
- It wasn't a palace.
What is in there?
- Wait and see.
These are for you, Grandmother. Lots of soff rolls.
It's lovely you're back, Heidi.
A big sausage for you, Peter.
Thank you.
Grandfather!
Heidi!
Morning, Little Swan and Little Bear.
Peter, I'm coming!
No!
So, here's your half.
- Thank you.
Dear Klara, the village is now under thick snow.
Everything is white and sparkling.
We have moved into the village so that I can go to school.
At school, boys sit on one side and girls on the other.
Our pastor is much stricter than Mr Kandidat.
Sometimes there are even canings. And poor Peter is always punished because he's always late.
Now tell me what you want to be when you grow up. A goatherd.
A farmer.
- Farmer. A blacksmith. Like my father.
Blacksmith.
I want to write stories.
Ouiet!
I see.
What letter is this?
' A'?
- A letter 'D'!
Almost every day after school, I try to teach poor Peter to read.
Oh Peter, you did this yesterday.
But it's not really working.
Oh Klara, I miss you so much.
I think about you every day. Please write to me.
"There's nothing I wish for more than for you to come and visit me."
"Yours, Heidi."
I didn't even say goodbye.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
It's Klara!
Peter, Peter, Peter!
Peter, look!
It's Klara. My dearest friend!
Klara!
Klara!
- Heidi!
Heidi, I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.
Grandmama!
- Heidi!
My dear child.
You see, Klara was in such an awful way, I resolved to bring her here.
Do you think she could stay here for a few days?
For a fee, of course.
Klara is our guest.
Okay.
- Sure?
Heidi!
Heidi, you have to help me get dressed.
You don't need this.
- Heidi!
Or any of this either.
Look. I don't need them either.
Heidi, not so fast.
Little Bear, Little Swan.
They're just like I imagined.
Peter, come!
Peter, look. It's Klara.
Klara, this is Peter.
Hello. I've heard so much about you.
Are you coming?
No.
- Why?
Let's go with him.
How will that work?
You can't walk.
Peter!
- Come on, let's go.
I'm not leaving Klara on her own.
Move, go!
- Peter!
He'll get over it.
We're going!
Move!
Heidi, I'd love to go up there with you two.
Come on!
Move!
Move!
Go home on your own.
You stupid bunch of goats.
Come on, get a move on!
Go!
Did you see that?
- Yes, a shooting star.
Now we can wish for something.
I wish that...
- No!
You're not allowed to say.
Damn!
Come on, goats!
Where is the wheelchair?
Heidi, where is it?
It's not here.
It's not here either.
It can't just disappear.
Grandfather, it's not here.
- What?
It's gone?
Impossible. Did you look everywhere?
Now I have to sit here all day and can't do anything.
Grandfather will think of something.
He'll be getting a piece of my mind.
Little Bear?
Thank you.
There you go.
I know what you did, General Goatherd.
Your bad conscience is probably punishment enough.
Now look affer the girls until I come back in the evening.
Do you understand me?
I'll go and get Peter.
- Yes, do.
Come out.
I don't want to.
Then don't.
He'll come for sure. As soon as there's food.
They're beautiful. It's just like you said. - See?
And now you're here.
I'll fetch some blueberries.
Klara!
Holy Mother of God.
Come over here!
Come on.
You can do it.
Try it.
I know you can do it!
Good day.
I'm here to collect my daughter.
Hello Alp-Uncle.
- Hello.
Mother, how could you bring Klara to a place like this?
Just look at it!
This is no place for a sick girl.
This hut, these rocks everywhere.
You must excuse my son.
I want to see my daughter right away. Where is she?
Father, here I am.
Klara.
Father.
My child.
You're walking.
Please forgive me.
Father.
You're walking.
- Klara.
This is a present for you, my dear child.
Thank you, Grandmama.
There's nothing in it.
Because you'll fill it up yourself.
What's wrong, child?
Everyone laughed at me.
- Why is that?
Because I want to write stories.
Is that right?
They just don't know any better, Heidi, because they only know this village.
But you've seen more of the world, haven't you?
If something in life brings you joy, then you simply have to do it, regardless of what people say.
It was so lovely to see you.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you too.
Goodbye.
Heidi, goodbye.
Adieu!

 State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki: Joint Sitting of Parliament
 8 February 2008
 Madam Speaker of the National Assembly;
 Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP);
 Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP;
 Deputy President of the Republic;
 Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament;
 Ministers and Deputy Ministers;
 Mr Jacob Zuma, Former Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Congress;
 Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary;
 Heads of our Security Services;
 Governor of the Reserve Bank;
 Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces;
 Chairperson of SALGA, mayors and leaders in our system of local government;
 Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders;
 Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy;
 Directors-General and other leaders of the public service;
 Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners;
 Distinguished guests, friends and comrades;
 People of South Africa:
 Allow me on this occasion of the penultimate Joint Sitting of the third Parliament for the annual debate on the state of our nation, to wish all the Honourable Members of Parliament a happy and productive New Year.
 I am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy, as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all. I say this because, in our own estimation, it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream. And such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today.
 I speak here today in the presence of my mother, Epainette Mbeki, MaMofokeng, who came to communicate an unequivocal message from the rural masses of the Transkei, among whom she has lived for many decades. She says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders, that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country, whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today. In eight days' time, on February 16, she will be 92 years old. What she expects as her birthday present is the truth. I thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today, and trust that we will not disappoint her.
 I would also like to take this opportunity to salute President Nelson Mandela, one of the pre-eminent founding fathers of our democracy, who will mark his 90th birthday on 18 July this year.
 We welcome to this occasion Mr Arthur Margeman, representing the veterans of the Alexandra bus boycott of fifty years ago, who include Nelson Mandela. We are also privileged to have among us Ms Jann Turner, the daughter of Rick Turner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago.
 We are also pleased that we have among us Mr Dinilesizwe Sobukwe, son of the outstanding patriot and leader, Robert Sobukwe, who also passed away 30 years back after enduring many years of imprisonment, banishment and other forms of repression. We acknowledge, both among the Honourable Members and our guests, the many founders of the United Democratic Front, 25 years ago.
 All these honoured guests, representing both memory and hope, remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all South Africans. Indeed, they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people, and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people.
 We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections. The Government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004.
 I am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004. However, and not unexpectedly, it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard.
 Given that we are approaching the end of our mandate term, the Government decided that it should identify a suite of Apex Priorities on which it must focus in a special way, using these as catalysts further to accelerate progress towards the achievement of the objectives the people mandated us to pursue.
 Happily, this State of the Nation Address has given me the possibility to report to Parliament and the Nation on our 24 Apex Priorities which, the Hon Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week.
 The identification of the Apex Priorities means that all three spheres of government, the national, provincial and local, at both executive and administrative levels, are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energise our advance towards the realisation of the all-important goal of a better life for all our people.
 The entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us, it will do its best to live up to the imperative – Business Unusual! We speak of Business Unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy, efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes, so that the lives of our people should change for the better, sooner rather than later.
 To make certain that this happens, we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Annual Budget the Minister of Finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the Apex Priorities. The main categories of these priorities are:
 * the further acceleration of our economic growth and development
 * speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals
 * improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy, and poverty eradication
 * enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training
 * accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all
 * revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime
 * further strengthening the machinery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to our development imperatives and,
 * enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations, with particular focus on some African issues and South-South relations.
 More than at any other time, the situation that confronts our nation and country, and the tasks we have set ourselves, demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one, to do all the things that have to be done, understanding that in a very real sense, all of us, together, hold our own future in our hands!
 As we act together everywhere in our country, this we must also understand that what we have to be about is – Business Unusual!
 As I was preparing this Address, one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow.
 He suggested that this morning, to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us, I should recall the well-known words with which Charles Dickens opened his novel, A Tale of Two Cities. And so I quote these words:
 "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only."
 You will ask whether I agree with this assessment, whether I too believe that we have entered an era of confusion, in which all of us cannot but lose our way, unsure of our steps, unsteady on our feet, fearful of the future!
 My answer to this question is a definite No! Like the rest of our Government I am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our country's forward march in the last 14 years remain in place. They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people. Thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation.
 However, like all the Honourable Members, I am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow.
 They are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity.
 They are concerned about some developments in our economy, especially the steady increase in interest rates, food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor. Some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the United States.
 They are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices. This is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the National Commissioner of Police, the suspension of the National Director of Public Prosecutions, fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes.
 They are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in Tshwane last month.
 While they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs, they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic, non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous South Africa.
 Most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom. The real challenge is to respond to them in a manner that conveys the definite message to everybody in our country and the millions in Africa and elsewhere in the world who watch our country with keen interest, that we remain firm in our resolve to continue building the kind of South Africa that has given hope not only to our people, but also to many others outside our borders.
 Let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the South Africa visualised in our Constitution.
 The national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course. This must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges, but surmountable challenges. And precisely because it is a period of challenges, it is also an era of opportunity!
 In this regard, I would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the Chief Executive of Anglo American, Cynthia Carroll, when she addressed the Mining Indaba here in Cape Town earlier this week, on Tuesday, February 5.
 As the Honourable Members know, she said: "I don't regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster. And South Africa is not alone: there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil.
 "Sure, the problems here are serious; overcoming them will require ingenuity, especially in energy efficiency and energy saving, as well as the development of alternative power supplies. But if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation, we will all come through – I hope relatively unscathed…This is not a time for finger pointing, but for working together in finding solutions."
 This having been said, it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the Government and Eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding. I would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties.
 In the past two weeks, the Ministers of Minerals and Energy and Public Enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation. Last week the Honourable Members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters.
 In essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream. The resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy. In this situation, we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin.
 As government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge. Among other things, we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient.
 There are concrete actions each individual, household and business can take. These are being disseminated by the Department of Minerals and Energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you, our compatriots, may give to us and share with one another.
 Government will start implementing a campaign to ensure efficient lighting, solar water heating and geyser load management in households, including housing standards for all new houses and developments. We urge households that can afford to act immediately to consider implementing these energy-saving measures.
 An instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not.
 The details of other voluntary and mandatory actions in the Power Conservation Programme have been set out by the Ministers and these will be refined through consultation with the various stakeholders and then published.
 On the supply side Eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of co-generation projects as a matter of urgency. We are taking steps to enhance Eskom's maintenance capacity. We have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects. All these actions, taken together with the electricity saving measures, will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin.
 The massive Eskom build programme in new generation, transmission and distribution capacity will continue; and where possible, some projects will be accelerated. In this regard, I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can. In a meeting with the Chairman of General Electric (GE) during the course of last week, GE offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf. In South Africa our own large companies such as Sasol, Anglo and BHP Billiton are all in concrete discussions with the Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint. The approach is one of common action rather than recrimination.
 I particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24th of January. We will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry.
 Collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency. Task teams are currently working in many areas. Next week the Provincial Premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country. They will be supported by technical teams from EDI Holdings, Eskom and the National Energy Efficiency Agency. The Department of Provincial and Local Government will co-ordinate this activity supported by the line Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises.
 I will convene a meeting of the Joint Presidential Working Groups to co-ordinate our overall actions. I will also shortly announce a team of 'Energy Champions' consisting of prominent and knowledgeable South Africans who will assist government with the energy efficiency campaign and inform investors and communities on the actual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges.
 The Minister of Finance will provide more information in the Budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to Eskom in its build programme.
 We face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period. This situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end. However, given our large base of installed generation capacity, for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity.
 We are a minerals resource economy. We must therefore continue to support the mining industry. It is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country, we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry. However it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient. Indeed, energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity.
 Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid. Let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us, inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for Business Unusual!
 This is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2009 and the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup which will kick off in our country 854 days from today. I mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully.
 Of course, I have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to FIFA and the world community of soccer players and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA Soccer World Cup tournament.
 The sense that we get, across all sectors of South African society and further afield, represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our all-round preparations, is one of - Business Unusual: all hands on deck for 2010! We must ensure that we sustain this approach.
 We are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud. I am certain that the South African Football Association, our coaches led by Carlos Alberto Parreira, and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and Africa should be proud.
 Once more we thank the Springboks for showing the way when they won the Rugby World Cup last year. This must inspire Bafana Bafana, as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the Beijing Olympic Games later this year.
 Let me now turn to the Apex Priorities I mentioned.
 Further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the Industrial Policy Action Plan. Government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employment-creation. In this regard, R2,3 billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further R5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy.
 Working together with business and labour, we shall also develop as urgently as possible, key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist, such as mining and minerals beneficiation, consumer durables, retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises, construction, the creative industries, agriculture and agro-processing.
 Once more I would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Motor Industry Development Programme is maintained.
 At the macro-economic level, we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability.
 To speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan, with specific emphasis on energy efficiency. This entails co-ordinating the programmes of the State-owned Enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans, including freight and other logistics, energy pipelines, information and communications technology, road infrastructure, water and electricity, both in terms of their timing and geographic location.
 Cutting across these plans, and therefore a critical priority, is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right. Accordingly, we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of Infraco. Already, money has been allocated for Sentech to become a wireless internet wholesaler as well as finance its digitisation. Working with other governments on the continent and the private sector, we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables.
 At the same time, we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50% of the population by the end of the year. Attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in South Africa of Set Top Boxes, which should be finalised by the middle of the year.
 Having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition, infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions, we have decided, in the spirit of Business Unusual, work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes.
 An element of government's Apex of Priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development. Work to review the National Human Resource Development Strategy will be completed this year, and the projects that the joint team of government, labour, business and academic institutions organised under the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition (JIPSA) will be intensified.
 Indeed, we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the CEOs of 70 of the JSE-listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills.
 In addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training (FET) colleges, the sector education and training authorities (SETAs), resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles, freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees, and speeding up on-the-job training for professional graduates.
 Further, after correcting weaknesses in our Adult Basic Education programme, which we identified last year, we shall this month launch the Kha Ri Gude (let us learn) mass literacy campaign. This will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008.
 Madame Speaker and Chairperson
 At the centre of our economic programmes is, and should always be, the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans, acting as an important weapon in our War on Poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all.
 In the programme to provide sustainable human settlements, we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum, and an agreement has been reached with the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme.
 Along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction, we continue to address a number many weaknesses, including the processing of the Land Use Management Bill, the finalisation of the land restitution cases, the support programme for those who acquire land, and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme.
 These are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year, and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves.
 Yet another critical Apex Priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive anti-poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge. These include children, women, the youth, people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements, people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly.
 Among the key proposed interventions are: expanding the public works programme, employment subsidies for direct job-creation for targeted groups, enhancing employment search capability, improving education and training, improving services and assets among poor communities, specific interventions in poor households, and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors. Among others, we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment.
 Parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14.
 But we will all agree that our society, and the poor specifically, cannot wait for strategies and dialogues and workshops – important as these may be. In any case, most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated. As such, in the spirit of Business Unusual, government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help, in the intervening period, to alleviate their plight in those individual households.
 For this, we will require a National War Room for a War Against Poverty bringing together departments such as Social Development, Provincial and Local Government, Trade and Industry, Agriculture and Land Affairs, Public Works and Health as well as provincial and local administrations, which will work with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency.
 We shall this year attend to other specific priorities which are critical to the country's war against poverty, in pursuit of socio-economic inclusion. These are:
 * speeding up land and agrarian reform with detailed plans for land acquisition, better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support, and improving the capital base and reach of the Micro-Agricultural Finance Institutions of South Africa (MAFISA) to provide micro-credit in this sector: focus will be placed on areas of large concentrations of farm dwellers and those with high eviction rates, and we aim to increase black entrepreneurship in agricultural production by 5% per year, and the audit on land ownership will be speeded up;
 * the Budget will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equalising the age of eligibility at 60, thus benefiting about half a million men;
 * intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to co-operatives and small enterprises especially those involving women, with emphasis on providing training and markets, including linking them up with established outlets;
 * scaling up the National Youth Service programme including a graduated increase of the intake in the Military Skills Development programme of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) from the current 4 000 to 10 000. R700 million has already been given to the SANDF to start scaling up this programme;
 * intensifying the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) which, by surpassing the set targets, has shown potential to absorb more entrants: this will include increased intake of young people in the programme to maintain public infrastructure, doubling the number of children enrolled in Early Childhood Development to over 600 000 through 1 000 new sites with more than 3 500 practitioners trained and employed, and increasing the number of care-givers. About R1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the EPWP; and, lastly,
 * introducing the system of products for preferential procurement by government from small, medium and micro-enterprises; and through the Small Enterprises Development Agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed.
 We will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements, with intensified efforts, as a matter of urgent priority, to accelerate universal access to water, sanitation and electricity, so that by 2014, we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services.
 Accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS. We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis (TB) defaulter rates from 10% to 7%, train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant TB patients receive treatment.
 We aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system, benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners.
 As we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for Business Unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation.
 Two such issues deserve brief mention.
 The first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies, as well as a Youth Pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all South Africans. The Minister of Education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters.
 The second issue is about geographic and place names, which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose. We will launch this synchronised process soon, guided by the South African Geographical Names Council and its provincial committees.
 Madame Speaker and Chairperson,
 When we reflected on the issue of crime at last year's Joint Sitting of Parliament, we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime, but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder – bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy.
 Accordingly, last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population, to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality.
 In this regard, in the spirit of Business Unusual, Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new, modernised, efficient and transformed criminal justice system. Among other things, this will entail setting up a new co-ordinating and management structure for the system at every level, from national to local, bringing together the judiciary and magistracy, the police, prosecutors, correctional services and the Legal Aid Board, as well as other interventions, including the empowerment of the Community Police Forums.
 As the Honourable Members are aware, some of these initiatives are already under way; but we are certain that, if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner, the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime. The Ministers of the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week.
 We shall also, during the course of this year, process the Bills on the transformation of the judiciary in consultation with judges and magistrates, complete the strategy aimed at strengthening border control and security, further give life to the Victims' Charter, pay particular attention to the issue of repeat offenders, and continue the implementation of additional measures deriving from recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
 Informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime, as well as the recommendations of the Khampepe Judicial Commission on the functioning and location of the Directorate of Special Operations and continuing reflections on this matter, including the reform of the Criminal Justice System, we shall by the end of March this year, interact with Parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime.
 What will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management, efficiency and co-ordination of our law-enforcement agencies.
 Of great importance, our success in the fight against crime depends on co-operation among all of us as law-abiding citizens, inspired by the principles of rule of law, respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights, which our Constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements.
 Honourable Members
 We will continue this year with efforts to improve the machinery of government so that it meets its obligations to citizens. If anything, the spirit of Business Unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants.
 There are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to, as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state.
 Firstly, it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging. The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision.
 Secondly, by May of every year (and within two months of the beginning of the financial year at local government level) all senior managers should have filed their Key Performance Agreements with relevant authorities. The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard.
 Thirdly, recognising that the Department of Home Affairs touches the core of every citizen's life, we will this year intensify the implementation of the turn-around strategy approved by Cabinet. This includes improving the information technology (IT) systems, training of staff on the new systems, rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new ID card.
 Improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management. Further, it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties – a task that belongs to the leadership, the public servants themselves and the trade union movement.
 In this regard, this year, in consultation with public sector unions, we will convene a Public Sector Summit to thrash out these issues so that the spirit of Batho Pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided.
 Working with other social partners, we shall ensure that, by the end of this year, the second National Anti-corruption Programme is adopted, and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented. At local government level, we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anti-corruption strategies.
 We shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-year Local Government Strategic Agenda. To ensure systematic monitoring in this regard, SALGA has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done.
 In order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans, women and youth, we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements, including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment.
 Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning. Thus, as part of our Apex Priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance government's capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans, covering all spheres of government.
 Honourable Members
 The programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the African Peer Review Mechanism.
 Our focus, in promoting the African Agenda this year, will be on the strengthening of the African institutions, including the African Union and its development programme, Nepad.
 This we shall do, inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels. A critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration.
 We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and hope to use our Chairpersonship of SADC in 2008/2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard.
 It is in this context, as well, that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the European Union, within the context of the process led by the African Union (AU), to ensure that the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement are completed as soon as possible, premised on accelerating the development of our region.
 Over the past year, we carried out the mandate of SADC to assist the political leadership of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face. We had an opportunity, on the fringes of the AU Summit in Addis Ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of SADC on this matter.
 In short, the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address. These include issues relating to the Constitution, security, media and electoral laws, and other matters that have been in contention for many years. The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament, including the necessary constitutional amendments. What is outstanding, however, is a procedural matter relating to the timing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed Draft Constitution.
 Accordingly, we join the SADC Heads of State and Government in congratulating the parties to the Zimbabwe Dialogue for their truly commendable achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter. As requested by the SADC Heads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negotiations. At the same time, we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29th of March.
 Our multifaceted relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue, as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace, and implement their reconstruction and development programme.
 Our government will remain seized of the processes under way in Kenya, Chad, Burundi, Darfur in the Sudan, Western Sahara, Côte d'Ivoire, Somalia, the Comoros and the Central African Republic to find lasting peace and stability.
 We are particularly concerned by the senseless violence and killings in both Kenya and Chad, developments that clearly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the regeneration of the African continent. We call on all African compatriots to do whatever we can, together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments.
 We will, of course, continue to carry out our tasks in the United Nations Security Council. Critical in this regard, is the strengthening of co-operation between the UN Security Council and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union.
 Impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples, particularly in the developing countries, we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the India-Brazil-South Africa forums, the New Africa-Asia Strategic Partnership, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and negotiations to complete the SACU-Mercusor trade agreement.
 In the same measure, we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and ongoing improvements in this regard, and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the WTO Doha Development Round.
 This year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Africa and the People's Republic of China. The mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the China-South Africa Partnership for Growth and Development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit, which can only grow from strength to strength.
 Next year, South Africa will play host to the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the World Conference Against Racism which was held in our country in 2001. We are confident that, informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity, the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Review Conference achieves its objectives.
 These global responsibilities, including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity. But we should not take this for granted.
 I am confident that, under the leadership of the International Marketing Council, Trade and Investment South Africa (TISA), Tourism South Africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of Business Unusual, and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate Africa's humanity in 2010.
 Madame Speaker, Chairperson and Honourable Members;
 Having said all that I have said, I come back to the question: what is the state of our nation as we enter 2008!
 What I do know and hereby make bold to say is: whatever the challenges of the moment, we are still on course!
 I say this with unshakeable conviction because I am certain that South Africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history – to strain every sinew of our being – to respond to the national challenges of the day, including those relating to our economy, the political and economic situation in Africa and elsewhere in the world, and seize the opportunities that our country's progress over the last fourteen years has provided.
 With all hands on deck, and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion, we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels.
 Thank you.

 Directors-General and other leaders of the public service;
 Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners;
 Distinguished guests, friends and comrades;
 People of South Africa:
 When she died, we knew that Mama Adelaide Tambo had been recently discharged from hospital. But because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living, we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion. But that was not to be.
 Tomorrow we will pay her our last respects as we inter her remains. Thus she will only be with us in spirit when in October this year, we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of her husband, the father of her children, her companion, her comrade, and an eminent son of our people, Oliver Reginald Tambo. Once more, we convey our condolences to the Tambo family.
 However, I am indeed very pleased to acknowledge in our midst this morning the Hon Albertina Luthuli, daughter of our first Nobel Peace Laureate, Inkosi Albert Luthuli, whose tragic death 40 years ago we commemorate this year, remembering the tragic day when it was reported that he had been crushed by a speeding train in the cane-fields of KwaDukuza. His death was as shocking and mysterious as his life was a lodestar pointing us to the freedom we enjoy today.
 I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of O.R. Tambo. I also know of the great pride felt by those who have been admitted into the ranks of the eminent National Orders.
 I am also pleased to welcome to the House the activists of the 1956 Women’s March and the 1976 Soweto Uprising who are sitting in the President’s box, as well as the eminent patriots from all our provinces, proposed by our Provincial Speakers to join the group of important guests who have joined us today.
 The government of the people of South Africa on whose behalf I speak here today, as I have been privileged to do in previous years, was formed in 2004, after the General Elections of that year.
 At its annual January Lekgotla or Bosberaad last month, the National Cabinet that stands at the pinnacle of the system of governance over which we are privileged to preside, reflected on the fact that its meeting marked the mid-term of the life of the government born of our last, 2004, elections.
 Having understood this, it was natural that we should put the question to ourselves – what progress have we made in the quest to achieve the objectives to which we honestly told the nation we were committed, as a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from 2004 until the next elections in 2009!
 With your indulgence, I would like to step further back, and recall what we said, in 2004, as representatives of our people, in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world, convened at our seat of government the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Freedom Day, the 10th anniversary of our liberation, and participated in the Inauguration of the President of the Republic, whom our Parliament had chosen, respecting the will of the people democratically demonstrated during the 2004 elections.
 On that occasion we said in part:
 “For too long our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society…
 “It was a place in which to be born black was to inherit a lifelong curse. It was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden rage…
 “It was a place in which squalor, the stench of poverty, the open sewers, the decaying rot, the milling crowds of wretchedness, the unending images of a landscape strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse, assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets, and wooded lanes, and flowers’ blossoms offsetting the green and singing grass, and birds and houses fit for kings and queens, and lyrical music, and love.
 “It was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to prey on you or to condemn oneself to prey on others, guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug stupors that would dull the pain of living, who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst, and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause.
 “It was a place in which to live in other neighbourhoods was to enjoy safety and security because to be safe was to be protected by high walls, electrified fences, guard dogs, police patrols and military regiments ready to defend those who were our masters, with guns and tanks and aircraft that would rain death on those who would disturb the peace of the masters…
 “We have gathered here today, on Freedom Day, because in time, our people, together with the billions of human beings across the globe, who are our comrades-in-arms and whom our distinguished guests represent, decided to say – an end to all that! …
 “We are greatly encouraged that our General Elections of a fortnight ago confirmed the determination of all our people, regardless of race, colour and ethnicity, to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream…
 “None of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty. This relates to everything, from the improvement of the health of our people, to reducing the levels of crime, raising the levels of literacy and numeracy, and opening the doors of learning and culture to all…
 “We pledge to all the heroes and heroines who sacrificed for our freedom, as well as to you, our friends from the rest of the world, that we will never betray the trust you bestowed on us when you helped to give us the possibility to transform South Africa into a democratic, peaceful, non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous country, committed to the noble vision of human solidarity.
 “The work to create that South Africa has begun. That work will continue during our Second Decade of Freedom.”
 Fifty years before, as they prepared to convene the Congress of the People, which adopted the Freedom Charter, the patriots of the day had said, “Let us speak together, all of us together – African and European, Indian and Coloured … all the people of South Africa …Let us speak together of freedom. And of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free”.
 We must today renew our pledge, to speak together of freedom, to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty, to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream, to say, together, in action – enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society!
 We must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office, fully conscious that “none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty”, and therefore that “the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new South Africa”.
 Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream, our government committed itself, working with all South Africans, to implement detailed programmes intended:
 * to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy;
 * to reduce the cost of doing business in our country;
 * to promote the growth of the small and medium business sector;
 * to speed up the process of skills development;
 * to improve our export performance, focussing on services and manufactured goods;
 * to increase spending on scientific research and development;
 * to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy;
 * to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment;
 * to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alleviation;
 * to expand access to such services as water, electricity and sanitation;
 * to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole;
 * to intensify the housing programme;
 * to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture;
 * to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities;
 * to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth, reconstruction and development of our country;
 * to accelerate the process of renewal of the African continent; and
 * increasingly to contribute to the resolution of major questions facing peoples of the world.
 Madame Speaker and Chairperson;
 I am happy to report that with regard to each of these commitments, government remains hard at work to ensure that the nation’s objectives are met.
 At an average of over 4,5%, the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its highest since we attained our democracy in 1994. Investment in the economy, by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11%, with overall public sector infrastructure spending increasing by an annual average of 15,8%. Today, fixed investment as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product – at about 18,4% – is at its highest since 1991.
 The number of employed people has been increasing at about half-a-million a year in the past three years.
 We have seen steady progress in the advancement of Black people in the economy. From owning just over 3% of the market capitalisation of the JSE in 2004, this has increased to close on to 5%; and the proportion of Blacks in top management has grown from 24% of the total to 27%. Yet we must remain concerned that these figures are still woefully low.
 The advances in the economy have thrown up major challenges for all of us. The massive and sustained increase in consumer demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population; and the major infrastructure projects that we are embarking on demand massive input of supplies and machinery.
 But our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs. While household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income, the fact that South Africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations. The continuing occasional volatility of our currency has also not boded well for our export industries.
 Over the past three years, the economy has created some one-and-half million jobs. It is encouraging that in the year March 2005 to March 2006 alone, 300 000 of the jobs created were in the formal sector outside of agriculture, representing a growth rate of about 4%.
 A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme. But there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly. There is also no question that we can do much better to create self-employment through small and micro-enterprises. And given that a large majority of the unemployed are youth, we can do much better in terms of such interventions as the National Youth Service and the development of young entrepreneurs.
 It is a matter of pride that, in line with our commitment to build a caring society, we have since 2004 improved service provision and other aspects of the social wage. While beneficiaries of social grants numbered about 8 million in 2004, today 11 million poor South Africans have access to these grants. It is encouraging that the rates of increase in uptake have, in the recent period, been within manageable ranges, as the programmes reach maturity. This will ensure sustainability, and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more jobs and business opportunities.
 The housing programme has seen close to 300 000 new subsidies allocated in the past two years. However, as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way, the pace of roll-out has been much slower than we expected. We must act to change this situation.
 As Honourable members are aware, we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport. These include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the Moloto Rail Corridor in Mpumalanga around which feasibility work has started, the Klipfontein Corridor in Cape Town and the Gautrain project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system.
 These and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy, combining both road and rail. We will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people.
 Access to electricity, water and sanitation has improved. By 2005, South Africa had already achieved the Millennium Development Goal in respect of basic water supply, with improvement of access from 59% in 1994 to 83% in 2006. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), South Africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation. In the words of the UNDP Human Development Report of 2006:
 “… South Africa has demonstrated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy… Rights-based water reform has enabled it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherited from apartheid, partly through rights-based entitlements”. (pp62/63)
 We should indeed celebrate this great achievement. But it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water. Many more are without electricity and sanitation.
 We are proud that within one year, we have been able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in established settlements by almost half. We are on course to put an end to this dehumanising system in these areas by the end of this year.
 We will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty.
 An examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by 2004, though at a slow pace. This applies to literacy levels, gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates. The fluctuating Matric pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement. At the same time, the number of Matric students who pass Mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in 1995. We also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the Adult Basic Education programme.
 While the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period, we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases, many of which are much more complex. On the other hand, very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution. We will undertake a careful review of the inhibiting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up.
 All these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to afflict many of our people. The work done during the course of last year, by women through the South African Women in Dialogue working with various government departments, including a visit to countries such as Tunisia and Chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty, does point to some defects in our systems in this regard. From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things:
 * Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country;
 * Develop a proper database of households living in poverty;
 * Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households;
 * Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty;
 * In this context, address all indigence, especially the high numbers of women so affected;
 * Co-ordinate and align all anti-poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication; and,
 * Accelerate the training of Family Social Workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored.
 This will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities, continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market. In the meantime, we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage.
 A critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensification of joint efforts among all South Africans to improve social cohesion.
 In this year of the 60th anniversary of the Doctors Pact of leaders of African and Indian communities (AB Xuma, GM Naicker and Yusuf Dadoo), the 30th anniversary of the murder of Steve Biko and the 20th anniversary of the visit to Dakar by Afrikaner intellectuals to meet the ANC, the issue of our variety of identities and the overarching sense of belonging to South Africa needs to be better canvassed across society, in a manner that strengthens our unity as a nation. Further, on this the 30th anniversary of the banning of The World and The Weekend World newspapers, we are duty-bound to ask the question - have we all fully internalised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging, reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together!
 In other words, measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone. We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay, and work to attain the happiness that comes with it.
 Madame Speaker and Chairperson;
 I am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime. In the 1994 RDP White Paper we said:
 “Promoting peace and security will involve all people. It will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities…with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected…
 “Peace and political stability are also central to the government’s efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investment…Decisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness, drug trafficking, gun running, crime and especially the abuse of women and children.”
 Certainly, we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear, closeted behind walls and barbed wire, ever anxious in their houses, on the streets and on our roads, unable freely to enjoy our public spaces. Obviously, we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime.
 While we have already surpassed that targeted figure of 152 000 police officers employed in the South African Police Service, and while we have improved the training programme, we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security. While we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes, the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery, assault and murder is still below the 7-10% that we had targeted. And the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level.
 The increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers’ strike should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private affair of the private sector. Quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate. This applies to such issues as wage levels, personnel vetting systems, enforcement of guidelines on cash-delivery vehicles, and so on.
 This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year, so that, in addition to improving the work of the police, we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public, in which huge resources are expended, are actually met.
 We will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts, to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs. And we will ensure that decisions to expand the Correctional Services infrastructure, improve the management of Border Control as well as the immigration and documentation services, among others, are implemented.
 Many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation. As such, in the period leading up to 2009, the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda.
 What has emerged, among others, as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development Institute (SAMDI) which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants.
 Compliance levels within departments, in relation to public service and finance management legislation, have been somewhat mixed. Obviously this cannot be allowed to continue, even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent. In this regard, the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial.
 Programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace. Immediately after the March 2006 local government elections, induction programmes were conducted, taking into account that 62% of the mayors are new.
 What is of concern, though, is that in many of these municipalities, many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions. For instance, in September last year, 27% of municipalities did not have municipal managers; in the Northwest Province, the vacancy rate at senior management level was over 50%; and in Mpumalanga only 1% of senior managers had concluded Key Performance Agreements.
 We continue to respond to these challenges and will undertake all necessary tasks, informed by our Five Year Local Government Strategic Agenda, which includes hands-on assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures, the deployment of skilled personnel including professional volunteers from the public, and strengthening the Ward Committees – 80% of which have been established across the country.
 The programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government (that is, the National Spatial Development Perspective, Provincial Growth and Development Strategies and Integrated Development Plans) is continuing, with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metros. These pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year.
 It is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their Growth and Development Summits, and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of February. This will lay the basis for co-operation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development.
 Honourable Members;
 I would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative (AsgiSA), working with the Ministers and Premiers who constitute the Task Team, concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-absorption, as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system. We highly appreciate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service managers, across the three spheres of government, in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole. This is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty.
 In this regard, in order further to speed up the implementation of AsgiSA, over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past, government will this year:
 * complete the process of reviewing the country’s experience in the articulation among such macro-economic indicators as the Exchange Rate, inflation and interest rates, so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets, and have the potential to absorb large pools of semi-skilled workers;
 * in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed, we will:
 - intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in Business Process Outsourcing, tourism, bio-fuels and chemicals, and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper, clothing and textiles, metals and engineering;
 - develop an overarching strategy to prioritise key interventions in mining and mineral beneficiation, agriculture and agro-processing, the white goods sector, creative industries, community and social services and pharmaceuticals. This must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods. With regard to mineral beneficiation for instance, we will set up a State Diamond Trader that will purchase 10% of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cutters and producers. We are happy that DeBeers has agreed to assist free of charge with management, technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years;
 - develop programmes to facilitate investments in sectors along the supply chain for our infrastructure programmes, including capital goods in ICT, transport and energy: with regard to energy, we will also expedite our work to ensure greater reliance on nuclear power generation, natural gas and the various forms of renewable sources of energy. With regard to communications, I am pleased to announce that the Department of Communications together with the mobile telephone companies and Telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers. In addition, Telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to 10 development call centres each employing 1000 persons, as part of the effort to expand the BPO sector. These centres will be established in areas identified by government. The special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries.
 * We will also take a variety of steps to improve competition in the economy, among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment, including practical introduction of the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) system, developing high-speed national and international broadband capacity, finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators, and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities.
 The progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of Further Education and Training (FET) Colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans. Starting this year, resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need, who enter these institutions. At the same time, we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the FET system. We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people, that artisan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification.
 After intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities, agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided.
 In this regard, we wish to commend the role played by the Joint Initiative on Skills Acquisition (JIPSA), which brings together government, business, labour, training institutes and others.
 As the Honourable Members know, we have also significantly increased the number of non-fee paying schools.
 In carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the best ever. We wish in this regard to congratulate our Local Organising Committee (LOC) and other partners for the sterling work they are doing.
 Quite clearly, in order to ensure that all South Africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy, these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the Second Economy. Because of this, during the course of this year, we will among other things:
 * take further practical action to improve access to micro-finance including the reach of the Apex Fund (SAMAF) and the agricultural micro-credit fund (MAFISA);
 * ensure the proper functioning of the Small Enterprises Development Agency, SEDA;
 * process the Companies Bill, adopted for public comment by Cabinet last Wednesday, as part of the battery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small, medium and micro-enterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees;
 * having surpassed the 10 000 target we set ourselves, we will increase the number of young people engaged in the National Youth Service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard, enrol 30 000 young volunteers in community development initiatives, and employ 5 000 young people as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme in the maintenance of government buildings;
 * intensify efforts to integrate youth development into the mainstream of government work, including a youth co-operatives programme, and the ongoing efforts to link unemployed graduates with employment opportunities – and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies, public and private, big and small, which have responded in a splendid and practical manner to this initiative; and,
 * start implementing the Communal Land Rights Act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land, while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation, seeds and implements to small and co-operative farmers.
 Honourable Members;
 The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of South Africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society. For us it is not a mere cliché to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society.
 In order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years, we aim this year to complete the work already started to reform our system of social security so that phased implementation can start as early as possible. A critical part of this reform will be the task of repairing a defect identified in the 2002 Report of the Committee of Inquiry into a Comprehensive System of Social Security in South Africa. This is that the contributory earnings-related pillar of our social security system is missing or unreliable for large numbers of working people. The principle guiding this approach is that, over and above social assistance provided through the government budget, we need to explore the introduction of an earnings-related contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity.
 This will mean that all South Africans will enjoy membership of a common, administratively efficient social insurance system, while those earning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes. In the discussions thus far conducted within government, consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include:
 * continuation of the minimum benefits contained in our social grants system with the benefits paid through a modern administrative system;
 * a wage subsidy for low-wage employees, possibly directed at first entrants into the job market, especially young people; and
 * a social security tax to finance basic retirement savings, death, disability and unemployment benefits.
 The Minister of Finance will further elaborate on these issues in the Budget Speech. What we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation, government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through NEDLAC.
 In addition, we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of 14 years.
 Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include:
 * speeding up of the construction of low-cost housing which will require the urgent establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle to handle finances, piloting of the Land Use Management Bill and ensuring that the remaining elements of the much-delayed agreement with the private sector on low-cost housing are finalised;
 * speeding up the implementation of the taxi recapitalisation project, implementing detailed plans for passenger rail and road transport including the Bus Rapid Transit System in the Metros and recapitalisation of Metrorail: and in this regard, let me take this opportunity to emphasise that government and our partners in SANTACO will not be bullied into abandoning the taxi recapitalisation project, and any attempts to undermine public order in pursuit of selfish interests will be dealt with accordingly;
 * expanding access to Early Childhood Development both as part of the programme to improve the general education system and as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme;
 * expanding training and employment of nurses and social workers as well as auxiliaries, increasing the number of training institutions, improving the quality of training, and instituting a bursary system;
 * continuing with the implementation of the remuneration dispensation for medical professionals, and providing additional resources further to improve the remuneration levels of teachers;
 * ensuring the implementation, without further delay, of measures to reduce the cost of medicines; and
 * continuing work to address especially the various non-natural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases, malaria, the various strains of TB, road accidents and violent crime.
 In this regard, government commits itself to intensify the campaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention, home-based care and treatment. We shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened, and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against AIDS and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible.
 This year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in 2008, sanitation in 2010 and electricity in 2012. We shall also finalise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social cohesion, including the comprehensive and integrated anti-poverty strategy we have mentioned, as well as address issues pertaining to national unity, value systems and identity.
 All these efforts, Madame Speaker and Chairperson, must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security. In this regard, government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented. The challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies.
 Rather, what is required is effective organisation, mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement, intelligence and corrections officers, and functionaries of the justice system. The overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families, in defence of our freedom and our security.
 In addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing, government will this year:
 * continue to improve the remuneration and working conditions of the police, and start the process of further expanding the personnel of the South African Police Service to bring their total number to over 180 000 within three years, and ensure optimal utilisation of the electronic monitoring and evaluation system that has just been introduced;
 * bring to full capacity the forensic laboratories which have been equipped with the latest technology, and ensure the optimum utilisation of the finger-print database – indeed, many of the recent successes in solving serious crime incidents have been facilitated by these systems;
 * bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity, by filling vacant posts, improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the Task Team that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this vital institution;
 * implement the recommendations of the Khampepe Commission on the mandate and operations of the Directorate of Special Operations (Scorpions);
 * start the process of further modernising the systems of the South African Revenue Services, especially in respect of border control, and improve the work of the inter-departmental co-ordinating structures in this regard;
 * intensify intelligence work with regard to organised crime, building on the successes that have been achieved in the last few months in dealing with cash-in-transit heists, drug trafficking and poaching of game and abalone;
 * utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service, in order massively to reduce case backlogs;
 * finalise remaining elements of measures to transform the judiciary and improve its functioning, in consultation with this eminent institution of our democracy;
 * implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the White Paper on Corrections;
 * continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies, and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws; and
 * improve our analysis of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime combating. In this regard, we must respond to the cold reality that, as in other countries, the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention.
 As we have already said, these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police, to make life more and more difficult for the criminals.
 In this regard, we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground, and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime. Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work, and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens.
 I should mention in this regard that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important Community Police Forums.
 Madame Speaker and Chairperson;
 Further to improve its service to the people, government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency. To achieve these objectives, we will during the course of this year:
 * strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres, including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system;
 * complete, within the next 18 months, legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards, remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions;
 * intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development, while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres;
 * conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government, as well as the Offices of the Premiers, while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments;
 * while intensifying the public sector and national anti-corruption campaign, complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effectiveness of our anti-corruption strategies for all spheres of government;
 * roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level, intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more Multi-Purpose Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational; and,
 * further capacitate and provide more support to the institution of traditional leadership.
 Improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation. In this regard, two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007. As of two days ago 6 000 field workers from Statistics South Africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 280 000 households chosen to participate in a Community Survey, which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country.
 In October another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in South Africa's first national panel study, the National Income Dynamics Study. These 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time, to further our understanding of such issues such as migration, labour market transitions, inter-generational mobility and household formation and dissolution. I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings.
 Madame Speaker and Chairperson:
 Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region. We are proud, as South Africans, of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about – from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of Patrice Lumumba.
 We will continue to work with the sister people of the DRC, as well as Burundi, the Comoros and Sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development.
 However, while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that Africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development, we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict, particularly the general peace process in Sudan, including the situation in Darfur, Côte d’Ivoire and Somalia.
 Our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits, to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Somalia. Critical in this regard, are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within Somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable, based on the need to achieve national reconciliation.
 This year the African Peer Review Forum will complete its review of our country. I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators, government Ministers and departments, our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy. We will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process.
 Similarly, we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the NEPAD programmes.
 Just over a month ago, South Africa started its tour of duty as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. We hereby wish to pledge, on behalf of the people of South Africa, that we will, in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies, do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security.
 In this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of Palestine, Israel, Iraq, Iran and other countries in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.
 We shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent, our partners in India, Brazil and the People’s Republic of China, other countries of the South, as well as Japan, Europe and North America.
 One of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations. We are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found, and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition.
 Madame Speaker, Chairperson and Honourable Members;
 Since the popular mandate of 2004, we have made welcome progress in further changing South Africa for the better. We should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront.
 But the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that, working together, we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - to build a better life for all, in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society.
 We should today, even more confidently, speak together of freedom. We should dare to act in concert to pursue the “happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free”.
 We are not there yet. But no one, except ourselves, shall ensure that this dream is realised. And so, let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work, fully understanding that the task to build the South Africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share.
 Thank you.

 State of the Nation Address By His Excellency JG Zuma, President of the Republic of South Africa, at the Joint Sitting of Parliament, Cape Town
 11 February 2010
 Honourable Speaker;
 Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
 Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP;
 Deputy President of the Republic, Honourable Kgalema Motlanthe;
 Honourable Chief Justice of the Republic of South Africa and all esteemed members of the Judiciary;
 Isithwalandwe President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela;
 Former President FW de Klerk;
 Our father, Former President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia;
 Former deputy presidents;
 Distinguished premiers and speakers of our provinces;
 Chairperson of SALGA and all local government leadership;
 Chairperson of the National House of Traditional Leaders;
 Heads of Chapter 9 Institutions;
 The Governor of the Reserve Bank;
 Special international guests, especially the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Mr Jean Ping;
 Former political prisoners and veterans;
 Members of the diplomatic corps;
 South African and foreign media;
 Fellow South Africans,
 Dumelang, molweni, goeie naand, good evening, sanibonani nonke emakhaya!
 Siyavuya ukuba nani ngobubusuku bubaluleke kangaka.
 Honorouble Speaker;
 I stand before you this evening, 20 years since President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela walked out of prison.
 We have chosen this as the day to call this Joint Sitting of Parliament to deliver the State of the Nation Address, to celebrate a watershed moment that changed our country.
 The release of Madiba was brought about by the resolute struggles of the South African people. Former political prisoners and veterans who are with us here witnessed that because they were part of that process.
 You will off course recall that the masses of this country, in their different formations, responded with determination to the call to make the country ungovernable and apartheid unworkable.
 We are celebrating this day with former political prisoners who we have specially invited to join us.
 We welcome in particular those who have travelled from abroad to be here, Helene Pastoors, Michael Dingake from Botswana, Mr Andimba Toivo ya Toivo of Swapo in Namibia.
 We are pleased to be joined by members of the legal team in the Rivonia Treason trial – Lord Joel Joffe, who is now based in London and Judge Arthur Chaskalson.
 We also remember and pay tribute to Mr Harry Schwarz, who sadly passed away last week.
 He was, among other things, a member of the Rivonia defence team.
 We extend our gratitude to our friends and comrades in the international community, for fighting side by side with us to achieve freedom.
 We extend a special welcome to the Mandela family.
 They became a symbol of the sacrifices of many who bore the brunt of apartheid.
 We greet the leadership of the ruling party and Alliance partners, for whom this is an extra special occasion.
 Compatriots and friends,
 On this special day, we must also acknowledge the contribution of those within the leadership of the National Party, who eventually realised that apartheid had no future.
 Allow me to mention the role played by former President PW Botha.
 It was he who initiated the discussion about the possibility of the release of political prisoners.
 President Botha worked with the former Minister of Justice, Mr Kobie Coetzee, who was in turn assisted by Dr Neil Barnard and Mr Mike Louw.
 They played a significant role in the process leading to the release of Madiba.
 Honourable compatriots,
 South Africa is yet to acknowledge in full, the critical role played by the former President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Tambo, who laid the foundation for this country to become a shining example of freedom and democracy.
 It was his outstanding leadership, foresight and clarity of vision that led the ANC to intensify the pursuit of a negotiated settlement.
 His wisdom was also displayed in the Harare Declaration, which he wrote and championed.
 It was this that laid the groundwork for the historic announcements by President FW de Klerk, 20 years ago.
 In this, President de Klerk demonstrated great courage and decisive leadership.
 On this great day, let me also acknowledge the role played by the late Ms Helen Suzman.
 She was for a long time, a lone voice in Parliament, calling for change.
 We also recognise the role of the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who also called for Madiba’s release, as well as that of other political prisoners and the return of exiles.
 We reiterate our heartfelt gratitude to the international community for its unwavering support to our struggle.
 These moments in our history demonstrate our ability to come together, even under the most difficult of circumstances, and to put the country’s interests first above all other interests.
 Deur saam te werk, kan ons meer bereik.
 Honourable members,
 During the course of this year, we will mark the centenary of the establishment of the Union of South Africa, which was established in 1910.
 This created a unitary state.
 Significantly, the exclusion of black people from this Union was one of the chief reasons for the formation of the African National Congress in 1912.
 As we mark this centenary later in the year, we should reflect on how far we have travelled as a country.
 Honourable members,
 We recall the words of Madiba on his release, when he said and I quote:
 "I stand before you, not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the people.
 Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today.
 I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands."
 These words inspire us not to rest until we achieve the ideals of a society free of poverty and deprivation.
 In the two decades since the release of Madiba, our country has changed fundamentally.
 President Mandela united this country behind the goal of a non-sexist, non-racial, democratic and prosperous South Africa.
 As we celebrate Madiba’s release today, let us recommit ourselves to building a better future for all South Africans, black and white.
 Let us pursue the ideal for which Madiba has fought his entire life – the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.
 Honourable members,
 We called a joint sitting in the evening so that the majority in our country, workers and schoolchildren, can be part of the occasion.
 We are impressed by the enthusiasm of the youth about the occasion.
 Two hundred and sixty six children from all provinces participated in the pre-State of the Nation debate on the role of the youth in the fight against poverty.
 We congratulate the overall winner, Charlotte Le Fleur of Worcester Secondary School, and all the participants for the hard work.
 Compatriots and friends,
 We are meeting against the backdrop of a global economic crisis.
 Last year, we experienced our first recession in 17 years.
 The crisis cost our economy about 900 000 jobs.
 Many of those who lost their jobs were the breadwinners in poor families.
 In February last year, government, business, labour and community representatives agreed on a package of measures to reduce the scale and impact of the crisis. We have put many of these measures in place.
 We have implemented decisive anti-recession spending by government, especially on infrastructure.
 To ensure a safety cushion for the poor, we brought social grant increases forward, and extended the Child-Support Grant to children over 14 years of age. In the next three years, an additional two million children from poor families and households, aged 15 to 18 years, will benefit from the Child-Support Grant.
 The Industrial Development Corporation has put aside R6 billion to help companies in distress.
 Government introduced a “training lay-off scheme” to allow workers the option of a period of training instead of retrenchment.
 These efforts were enhanced by our Public Works Programme.
 The nation will recall that during the 2009 State of the Nation Address, I announced that the Expanded Public Works Programme would create 500 000 work opportunities by December 2009.
 These are job opportunities created to provide unemployed people with an income, work experience and training opportunities.
 Honourable members, Fellow South Africans,
 We are pleased to announce that by the end of December, we had created more than 480 000 public works job opportunities, which is 97% of the target we had set.
 The jobs are in areas like construction, home and community-based care, and environmental projects.
 We have identified some areas of improvement, which we will effect going forward, including ensuring more labour-intensive projects.
 We know that these and other measures cannot fully mitigate the effects of the recession.
 We are grateful for the spirit of family, community and voluntary work that inspires many people to help those most affected by the crisis, through these difficult times.
 Honourable members,
 Economic indicators suggest that we are now turning the corner.
 Economic activity is rising in South Africa, and we expect growth going forward.
 The labour statistics released on Tuesday, show that the economy is now creating jobs rather than shedding them.
 It is too soon, though, to be certain of the pace of recovery.
 Government will therefore not withdraw its support measures.
 Now is the time to lay the groundwork for stronger growth going forward, and for growth that gives rise to more jobs.
 Our long-term infrastructure programme will help us grow faster.
 Our education and skills programmes will increase our productivity and competitiveness.
 Our Industrial Policy Action Plan and our new focus on green jobs, will build stronger and more labour-absorbing industries.
 Our rural development programme will improve rural productivity, and the lives of people living in rural areas.
 Underpinning our strategy for economic recovery and growth, is our capital investment programme.
 Over the next three years, government will spend R846 billion on public infrastructure.
 On transport, we will maintain and expand our road network.
 We will ensure that our rail network is reliable, competitive and better integrated with our sea ports.
 To ensure reliable power supply, we have established an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Energy, to develop a 20-year integrated resource plan.
 Among other things, this will look at the participation of independent power producers, and protecting the poor from rising electricity prices.
 We will establish an independent system operator, separate from Eskom Holdings.
 Eskom will continue to build additional generation capacity and improve the maintenance of its power stations.
 To ensure the promotion of an inclusive economy, to aid growth and development, we have established the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council, chaired by the President.
 The most urgent focus of policy change must be interventions to create jobs for young people.
 Unemployment rates for young people are substantially higher than the average.
 Proposals will be tabled to subsidise the cost of hiring younger workers, to encourage firms to take on inexperienced staff.
 A further expansion of public employment programmes is also underway.
 This includes local infrastructure and tertiary projects and literacy projects, home-based care, school maintenance and early childhood development initiatives.
 Last year we launched the National Youth Development Agency.
 We have directed the agency to work faster to establish its structures, throughout the country, so that it can assist us to mainstream youth development programmes within government.
 Honourable members,
 When this administration came into office last year, we undertook to work harder to build a strong developmental state.
 We said it would be a state that responds to the needs and aspirations of the people, and which performs better and faster.
 This year, 2010, shall be a year of action.
 The defining feature of this administration will be that it knows where people live, understands their needs and responds faster.
 Government must work faster, harder and smarter.
 We will expect the Executive and the Public Service to comply with this vision.
 We are building a performance-oriented state, by improving planning as well as performance monitoring and evaluation.
 We also need to integrate gender equity measures into the Government’s Programme of Action.
 This action will ensure that women, children and persons with disabilities can access developmental opportunities.
 We are pleased to announce a new way of doing things in government.
 The work of departments will be measured by outcomes, developed through our performance monitoring and evaluation system.
 The ministers who are responsible for a particular outcome, will sign a detailed delivery agreement with the President.
 It will outline what is to be done, how, by whom, within what time period and using what measurements and resources.
 As you are aware, we are committed to five priorities:
 education, health, rural development and land reform, creating decent work, and fighting crime.
 In addition, we will work to improve the effectiveness of local government, infrastructure development and human settlements.
 We will undertake a number of key activities towards the achievement of these outcomes.
 We have placed education and skills development at the centre of this government’s policies.
 In our 2010 programme, we want to improve the ability of our children to read, write and count in the foundation years.
 Unless we do this, we will not improve the quality of education.
 Our education targets are simple but critical.
 We want learners and teachers to be in school, in class, on time, learning and teaching for seven hours a day.
 We will assist teachers by providing detailed daily lesson plans.
 To students, we will provide easy-to-use workbooks in all 11 languages.
 From this year onwards, all grade 3, 6 and 9 students will write literacy and numeracy tests that are independently moderated.
 We aim to increase the pass rate for these tests from the current average of between 35 and 40% to at least 60% by 2014.
 Results will be sent to parents to track progress.
 In addition, each of our 27 000 schools will be assessed by officials from the Department of Basic Education.
 This will be recorded in an auditable written report.
 We aim to increase the number of matric students who are eligible for university admission to 175 000 a year by 2014.
 We urge parents to cooperate with us in making this a success.
 We welcome last month’s statement by the three teacher unions, NAPTOSA, SADTU and SAOU, reaffirming their commitment to the Quality Learning and Teaching Campaign from the beginning of 2010.
 Honourable members,
 We need to invest in our youth to ensure a skilled and capable workforce to support growth and job creation.
 We therefore plan to increase the training of 16-25 year olds in further education and training facilities.
 This will enable us to provide a second chance at education, for those who do not qualify for university.
 We are working with higher education institutions to ensure that eligible students obtain financial assistance, through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme.
 We have also set ambitious targets for skills development, to produce additional engineers and technicians, and to increase the number of qualified Mathematics and Science teachers.
 We must also increase the number of youth who enter learnerships in the private and public sectors.
 Another key outcome is to ensure a long and healthy life for all South Africans.
 We will continue to improve our healthcare system.
 This includes building and upgrading hospitals and clinics, and further improving the working conditions of healthcare workers.
 We have partnered with the Development Bank of Southern Africa to improve the functionality of public hospitals and their district offices.
 We are also collaborating with the DBSA and the Industrial Development Corporation, in a public-private partnership programme to improve hospitals and provide finance for projects.
 Honourable members,
 We must confront the fact that life expectancy at birth, has dropped from 60 years in 1994 to just below 50 years today.
 We are therefore making interventions to lower maternal mortality rates, to reduce new HIV infections and to effectively treat HIV and tuberculosis.
 We will also reduce infant mortality through the massive immunisation programme.
 We will reinstate health programmes in schools.
 We will implement all the undertakings made on World AIDS Day relating to new HIV prevention and treatment measures.
 Intensive work is underway to ensure that this work is on schedule.
 We will also continue preparations for the establishment of a national health insurance system.
 Fellow South Africans,
 We are working hard to ensure that everyone in South Africa feels safe and is safe.
 We will take further our work to reduce serious and violent crimes, and ensure that the justice system works efficiently.
 We are implementing plans to increase the number of policemen and women by 10% over the next three years.
 We have identified the fight against hijacking, business and house robberies, as well as contact crimes such as murder, rape and assault, as top priorities.
 We all have a role to play.
 Let us participate in community safety forums.
 Let us stop buying stolen goods.
 Let us always be ready to provide the police with information about criminal activity.
 Tshebedisano mmoho etla lwantsha botloko-tsebe.
 Compatriots and esteemed guests,
 Local government must work.
 Municipalities must improve the provision of housing, water, sanitation, electricity, waste management and roads.
 We held a meeting with mayors and municipal managers last year.
 This provided valuable insight into the challenges in local government.
 We also visited various communities and municipalities, including Balfour in Mpumalanga and Thembisa in Gauteng.
 After the Balfour visit, we sent a nine-member ministerial team to visit the area to address the issues that had been raised by the community.
 A number of issues have already received attention.
 I have directed the ministers to attend to the outstanding matters.
 We reiterate that there are no grievances that can justify violence and the destruction of property.
 We have directed law-enforcement agencies to take a tougher stance on lawlessness in Balfour and other areas.
 In December 2009, Cabinet approved a turnaround strategy for local government.
 This will ensure that local government has the correct management, administrative and technical skills.
 During this year of action, let us work together to make local government everybody’s business.
 We are working to upgrade well-located informal settlements and provide proper service and land tenure to at least 500 000 households by 2014.
 We plan to set aside over 6 000 hectares of well-located public land for low-income and affordable housing.
 A key new initiative will be to accommodate people whose salaries are too high to get government subsidies, but who earn too little to qualify for a normal bank mortgage.
 We will set up a guarantee fund of R1 billion to incentivise the private banking and housing sector, to develop new products to meet this housing demand.
 Bakwethu,
 Ngonyaka odlule sathi, abantu basemakhaya nabo banelungelo lokuba nogesi, amanzi, izindlu zangasese ezigijima amanzi nemigwaqo.
 Sathi kufanele babe nezindawo zezemidlalo kanye nezindawo zokuthenga ezinkulukazi eziphucuzekile njengasemadolobheni.
 In this regard, we launched the first pilot site of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme in Giyani, Limpopo, in August last year.
 Since then, 231 houses have been built.
 Progress has also been made in providing infrastructure to support agricultural development, and training for community members.
 Access to health and education facilities has improved.
 We are implementing similar programmes in seven sites across the country, benefiting 21 wards.
 By 2014, we aim to have sites in 160 wards.
 We want 60% of households in these sites to meet their food requirements from own production by 2014.
 Kancane kancane kuze kulunge, phela bakwethu, kuthiwa nempandla iqala ngenhlonhlo.
 We also need to better integrate land reform and agricultural support programmes.
 Our success in this area will be measured by the increase in the number of small-scale farmers that become economically viable.
 Honourable Speaker and Chairperson of the NCOP,
 We are not a water-rich country.
 Yet, we still lose a lot of water through leaking pipes and inadequate infrastructure.
 We will be putting in place measures to reduce our water loss by half by 2014.
 Honourable members,
 As part of our efforts to encourage greater economic growth, we are working to reduce the cost to communicate.
 The South African public can look forward to an even further reduction of broadband, cellphone, landline and public phone rates.
 We will work to increase broadband speed and ensure a high standard of Internet service, in line with international norms.
 Fellow South Africans,
 This government will ensure that our environmental assets and natural resources are well protected, and are continually enhanced.
 Together with Brazil, India and China, and joined by the United States, which represented the developed world, we made a significant contribution to the accord adopted at the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit in December last year.
 Although it does not go as far as required, it is an important step forward as it commits all countries to respond to climate change.
 We will work harder with our international counterparts towards a legally binding treaty.
 As South Africa, we have voluntarily committed ourselves to specific emission-reduction targets, and will continue working on our long-term climate change mitigation strategy.
 Honourable members,
 We will intensify efforts to promote the interests of South Africa globally.
 We will support efforts to speed up the political and economic integration of the SADC region, and promote intra-regional trade and investment.
 South Africa continues to play a leading role in continental efforts to strengthen the African Union and its organs, and to work for unity.
 We will focus energy on revitalising the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, as a strategy for economic development on the continent.
 Fellow South Africans,
 The Public Service has to respond to the call to make this term one of faster action and improved state performance.
 We require excellence and hard work.
 We need public servants who are dedicated, capable and who care for the needs of citizens.
 Government is already working on the development and implementation of a public service development programme, which will set the norms and standards for public servants in all spheres.
 Honourable Members,
 We continue our efforts to eradicate corruption and fraud in procurement and tender processes, and in applications for drivers’ licences, social grants and identity documents, among others.
 We are pleased with the progress government is making in some areas.
 This week, we terminated 32 687 fraudulent social grants payments, valued at R180 million.
 Our Inter-Ministerial Committee on Corruption is looking at ways to decisively defeat corruption.
 Nga u shumisana rothe ringa bveledza zwinzhi.
 Compatriots,
 As you are aware, we introduced the Presidential Hotline to make government and The Presidency more accessible to the public, and to help unblock service-delivery blockages.
 The hotline represents our determination to do things differently in government.
 It has made a difference in the lives of many South Africans.
 We can mention Mrs Buziwe Ngaleka of Mount Frere, whose call about her late husband’s pension was the first we took on the first day of the service.
 She is with us here tonight.
 We also have among us Mr Nkululeko Cele, who was helped to obtain identity documents, which allowed him to enrol at Tshwane University of Technology.
 These are just two among many success stories.
 From these and other examples, we identify weaknesses that should be rectified by various spheres of government.
 Through the Speaker, we have invited a multiparty delegation from Parliament to visit the call centre, so that MPs can get a first-hand account of the work done.
 Compatriots and friends,
 I have outlined the main elements of our plans for 2010, our collective commitment as government to the people of South Africa. The State of the Nation Address provides a broad overview of our action plan. Ministers will provide the detail in their respective Budget Vote speeches.
 Honourable members, fellow South Africans,
 In November this year, we will mark the 150th anniversary of the arrival of Indians in South Africa. It provides an opportunity to recognise the important contribution of the Indian community in the fields of labour, business, science, sport, religion, arts, culture and the achievement and consolidation of our democracy.
 Compatriots and friends,
 Let me take this opportunity to once again extend our heartfelt condolences to the Government and people of Haiti on the monumental tragedy that has befallen them.
 We are pleased that our rescue teams were able to go and assist.
 I would like to especially recognise one South African who never fails to assist in times of disasters, and helps us to promote the vision of a caring society. We welcome Dr Imtiaz Sooliman of the Gift of the Givers in this house today.
 Fellow South Africans,
 The hosting of the FIFA World Cup makes 2010 truly a year of action.
 We have spent many years planning for this World Cup. We only have three months to go. And we are determined to make a success of it. The infrastructure, security and logistics arrangements are in place to ensure a successful tournament.
 As a nation, we owe a debt of gratitude to the 2010 Local Organising Committee for their sterling effort. We wish the LOC Chairperson, Irvin Khoza, CEO Danny Jordaan and Bafana Bafana coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, all the best for the months ahead.
 President Mandela was central in assisting the country to win the rights to host this great event. We therefore have to make the World Cup a huge success in his honour.
 Compatriots, let us also stand behind the national team Bafana Bafana.
 I’m one of those who believe Bafana Bafana is going to produce surprises.
 Let us all buy tickets timeously to be able to attend the games.
 Fellow South Africans,
 As we celebrate Madiba’s release today, we recommit ourselves to reconciliation, national unity, non-racialism and building a better future together as South Africans, black and white.
 We are guided by what Madiba said in the dock, that and I quote:
 "During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people.
 I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.
 I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony, and with equal opportunities.
 It is an ideal which I hope to live for, and to achieve.
 But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."
 Inspired by our icon Madiba, it is my honour to dedicate this 2010 State of the Nation Address to all our heroes and heroines, sung and unsung, known and unknown.
 Let us work together to make this year of action a successful one for our country.
 I thank you.

 (6) (a) The Court shall decide whether or not to grant the appellant leave to appeal.
 Applications for leave to appeal may be dealt with summarily, without receiving oral or written argument other than that contained in the application itself.
 The Court may order that the application for leave to appeal be set down for argument and direct that the written argument of the parties deal not only with the question whether the application for leave to appeal should be granted, but also with the merits of the dispute. The provisions of rule 20 shall, with necessary modifications, apply to the procedure to be followed in such procedures.
 Procedure on appeal
 If leave to appeal is given in terms of rule 19, the appellant shall note and prosecute the appeal as follows:

 The judge or judges concerned shall give directions in regard to the compilation of the record, the time within which the record is to be lodged with the Registrar and any other matters which may be deemed by him or her or them to be necessary for the purpose of enabling the Court to deal with the appeal, which directions may include that the matter be referred back to the court a quo for the hearing of additional evidence specified in the directions, or that additional evidence be put before the Court by way of affidavit or otherwise for the purpose of the appeal.
 (a) One of the copies of the record lodged with the Registrar shall be certified as correct by the Registrar of the court appealed from.
 Copies of the record shall be clearly typed on stout A4-size paper, double-spaced in black record ink, on one side of the paper only.
 Legible documents that were typed or printed in their original form such as cheques and the like shall not be retyped and clear photocopies on A4-size paper shall be provided instead.
 The pages shall be numbered clearly and consecutively and every tenth line on each page shall be numbered and the pagination used in the court a quo shall be retained where possible.
 Bulky records shall be divided into separate conveniently-sized volumes of approximately 100 pages each. The record shall be securely bound in book format to withstand constant use and shall be so bound that upon being used will lie open without manual or other restraint.
 All records shall be securely bound in suitable covers disclosing the case number, names of the parties, the volume number and the numbers of the pages contained in that volume, the total number of volumes, the court a quo and the names of the attorneys of the parties.
 The binding required by this rule shall be sufficiently secure to ensure the stability of the papers contained within the volume; and where the record consists of more than one volume, the number of each volume and the number of the pages contained in a volume shall appear on the upper third of the spine of the volume.
 Where documents are lodged with the Registrar, and such documents are recorded on a computer disk, the party lodging the document shall where possible also make available to the Registrar a disk containing the file in which the document is contained, or transmit an electronic copy of the document concerned by e-mail in a format determined by the Registrar which is compatible with software that is used by the Court at the time of lodgement, to the Registrar at: registrar@concourt.org.za: Provided that the transmission of such copy shall not relieve the party concerned from the obligation under rule 1 (3) to lodge the prescribed number of hard copies of the documents so lodged.
 If a disk is made available to the Registrar the file will be copied and the disk will be returned to the party concerned. Where a disk or an electronic copy of a document other than a record is provided, the party need lodge only 13 copies of the document concerned with the Registrar.
 If a record has been lodged in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of subrule (1), the Registrar shall cause a notice to be given to the parties to the appeal requiring-
 the appellant to lodge with the Registrar written argument in support of the appeal within a period determined by the Chief Justice and specified in such notice;
 and the respondent to lodge with the Registrar written argument in reply to the appellant's argument by a specified date determined by the Chief Justice, which shall be subsequent to the date on which the appellant's argument was served on the respondent.
 The appellant may lodge with the Registrar written argument in answer to the respondent's argument within 10 days from the date on which the respondent's argument was served on the appellant.
 The Chief Justice may decide whether the appeal shall be dealt with on the basis of written arguments only.
 Subject to the provisions of subrule (5), the Chief Justice shall determine the date on which oral argument will be heard, and the Registrar shall within five days of such determination notify all parties to the appeal of the date of the hearing by registered post or facsimile.
 21 Additional information to be furnished to the Registrar
 When an application for confirmation of an order of constitutional invalidity or a notice of appeal against such order is lodged with the Registrar in terms of rule 16, or an application for leave to appeal is lodged in terms of rule 19, the applicant or appellant shall at the same time provide the Registrar with a note-
 (a) setting out the length of the record, or if the record consists of evidence that has not been transcribed, an estimate of the length of the record and the time required for transcription;
 (b) whether there are any special circumstances that may require a hearing of more than one day or which might otherwise be relevant to the directions to be given by the Chief Justice.

 27 Withdrawal of cases
 Whenever all parties, at any stage of the proceedings, lodge with the Registrar an agreement in writing that a case be withdrawn, specifying the terms relating to the payment of costs and payment to the Registrar of any fees that may be due, the Registrar shall, if the Chief Justice so directs, enter such withdrawal, whereupon the Court shall no longer be seized of the matter.

 Audio CD
 Ogg Vorbis is a fully free and unencumbered compressed audio format that is perfect for storing your compressed music on your computer . The sound quality is slightly better than Mp3 at the same bitrate . Note that not all mobile players support the Ogg Vorbis format .
 Flac is a lossless compressed audio format free of any patents or license fees . It maintains perfect CD audio quality while reducing file size by about 50 % . Because the filesize is much larger than Ogg Vorbis or Mp3 it is not recommended if you want to transfer your music to a mobile player .
 Wav is a basic , uncompressed audio file format . It takes up a lot of space but maintains perfect quality . It is generally not recommended unless you know what you are doing . If you want perfect quality , use Flac instead .
 Mp3 is the de facto standard in compressed audio compatible with almost all mobile players . It is however non free and generally not recommended .

 Mount root filesystem read-only
 Mount the root filesystem for this kernel read-only . Since the init scripts normally take care of remounting the root filesystem in read-write mode after running some checks , this should always be turned on . Do not turn this off unless you know what you are doing .
 Do not check partition table
 Record boot command lines for defaults
 Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the default for the following bootups . This way , lilo " locks " on a choice until it is manually overridden . This sets the lock option in lilo . conf
 Restrict parameters
 If this box is checked , a password ( entered below ) is required only if any parameters are changed ( i. e. the user can boot linux , but not linux single or linux init=/ bin/ sh ) . This sets the restricted option in lilo . conf .
 Require password :
 LILO Configuration
 ( c ) 2000 , Bernhard Rosenkraenzer
 Bernhard " Bero " Rosenkraenzer
 Select ...
 You can edit the lilo . conf file directly here . All changes you make here are automatically transferred to the graphical interface .
 Install boot record to drive/ partition :
 Select the drive or partition you want to install the LILO boot loader to here . Unless you intend to use other boot managers in addition to LILO , this should be the MBR ( master boot record ) of your boot drive . In this case , you should probably select / dev/ hda if your boot drive is an IDE drive or / dev/ sda if your boot drive is SCSI .
 Boot the default kernel/ OS after :
 / 10 seconds
 LILO will wait the amount of time specified here before booting the kernel ( or OS ) marked as default in the Images tab .
 Use linear mode
 Use compact mode
 Check this box if you want to use the compact mode . The compact mode tries to merge read requests for adjacent sectors into a single read request . This reduces load time and keeps the boot map smaller , but will not work on all systems .
 Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the defaults for the following boots . This way , lilo " locks " on a choice until it is manually overridden . This sets the lock option in lilo . conf .
 Default graphics mode on text console :
 You can select the default graphics mode here . If you intend to use a VGA graphics mode , you must compile the kernel with support for framebuffer devices . The ask setting brings up a prompt at boot time . This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot . If you need a per-kernel setting , go to the Operating systems tab and select Details .
 Enter LILO prompt automatically
 If this box is checked , LILO goes to the LILO prompt whether or not a key is pressed . If it is turned off , LILO boots the default operating system unless shift is pressed ( in that case , it goes to the LILO prompt ) . This sets the prompt option in lilo . conf .
 This is the list of kernels and operating systems you can currently boot . Select which one you want to edit here .
 Kernel :
 Enter the filename of the kernel you want to boot here .
 Label :
 Enter the label ( name ) of the kernel you want to boot here .
 Root filesystem :
 Enter the root filesystem ( i. e. the partition that will be mounted as / at boot time ) for the kernel you want to boot here .
 Initial ramdisk :
 If you want to use an initial ramdisk ( initrd ) for this kernel , enter its filename here . Leave this field blank if you do not intend to use an initial ramdisk for this kernel .
 Extra parameters :
 Enter any extra parameters you wish to pass to the kernel here . Usually , this can be left blank . This sets the append option in lilo . conf .
 Set Default
 Details
 This button brings up a dialog box with further , less commonly used , options .

 What do you know about the crash ?
 In this page you need to describe how much do you know about the desktop and the application state before it crashed .
 If you can , describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances , and what you were doing when the application crashed ( this information is going to be requested later . ) You can mention :
 actions you were taking inside or outside the application
 documents or images that you were using and their type/ format ( later if you go to look at the report in the bug tracking system , you can attach a file to the report )
 widgets that you were running
 the URL of a web site you were browsing
 configuration details of the application
 or other strange things you notice before or after the crash .
 Crash Information ( backtrace )
 This page will generate a " backtrace " of the crash . This is information that tells the developers where the application crashed .
 You can find more information about backtraces , what they mean , and how they are useful at %1

 Here you can change the component program . Components are programs that handle basic tasks , like the terminal emulator , the text editor and the email client . Different KDE applications sometimes need to invoke a console emulator , send a mail or display some text . To do so consistently , these applications always call the same components . You can choose here which programs these components are .
 Default Component
 Kmail is the standard Mail program for the KDE desktop .
 Use KMail as preferred email client
 Select this option if you want to use any other mail program .

 Total Memory
 This graph gives you an overview of the total sum of physical and virtual memory in your system .
 Physical Memory
 This graph gives you an overview of the usage of physical memory in your system . Most operating systems ( including Linux ) will use as much of the available physical memory as possible as disk cache , to speed up the system performance . This means that if you have a small amount of Free Physical Memory and a large amount of Disk Cache Memory , your system is well configured .
 Swap Space
 The swap space is the virtual memory available to the system . It will be used on demand and is provided through one or more swap partitions and/ or swap files .
 Memory Information This display shows you the current memory usage of your system . The values are updated on a regular basis and give you an overview of the physical and virtual used memory .

 Mouse This module allows you to choose various options for the way in which your pointing device works . Your pointing device may be a mouse , trackball , or some other hardware that performs a similar function .
 General
 If you are left-handed , you may prefer to swap the functions of the left and right buttons on your pointing device by choosing the 'left-handed ' option . If your pointing device has more than two buttons , only those that function as the left and right buttons are affected . For example , if you have a three-button mouse , the middle button is unaffected .
 The default behavior in KDE is to select and activate icons with a single click of the left button on your pointing device . This behavior is consistent with what you would expect when you click links in most web browsers . If you would prefer to select with a single click , and activate with a double click , check this option .
 Activates and opens a file or folder with a single click .
 If you check this option , pausing the mouse pointer over an icon on the screen will automatically select that icon . This may be useful when single clicks activate icons , and you want only to select the icon without activating it .
 If you have checked the option to automatically select icons , this slider allows you to select how long the mouse pointer must be paused over the icon before it is selected .

 Pointer acceleration :
 Pointer threshold :
 msec
 Double click interval :
 The double click interval is the maximal time ( in milliseconds ) between two mouse clicks which turns them into a double click . If the second click happens later than this time interval after the first click , they are recognized as two separate clicks .
 Drag start time :
 If you click with the mouse ( e. g. in a multi-line editor ) and begin to move the mouse within the drag start time , a drag operation will be initiated .
 Drag start distance :
 If you click with the mouse and begin to move the mouse at least the drag start distance , a drag operation will be initiated .
 Mouse wheel scrolls by :
 If you use the wheel of a mouse , this value determines the number of lines to scroll for each wheel movement . Note that if this number exceeds the number of visible lines , it will be ignored and the wheel movement will be handled as a page up/ down movement .

 Extra role :
 Machine :
 For selecting all windows belonging to a specific application , selecting only window class should usually work .
 Use window class ( whole application )
 For selecting a specific window in an application , both window class and window role should be selected . Window class will determine the application , and window role the specific window in the application ; many applications do not provide useful window roles though .
 Use window class and window role ( specific window )
 With some ( non-KDE ) applications whole window class can be sufficient for selecting a specific window in an application , as they set whole window class to contain both application and window role .
 Use whole window class ( specific window )

 System Notifications KDE allows for a great deal of control over how you will be notified when certain events occur . There are several choices as to how you are notified : As the application was originally designed . With a beep or other noise . Via a popup dialog box with additional information . By recording the event in a logfile without any additional visual or audible alert .

 System
 Konqueror Performance You can configure several settings that improve Konqueror performance here . These include options for reusing already running instances and for keeping instances preloaded .
 Disables the minimization of memory usage and allows you to make each browsing activity independent from the others
 With this option activated , only one instance of Konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many file browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . Be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
 With this option activated , only one instance of Konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . Be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously .
 If non-zero , this option allows keeping Konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed , up to the number specified in this option . When a new Konqueror instance is needed , one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead , improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances .
 If enabled , an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary KDE startup sequence . This will make the first Konqueror window open faster , but at the expense of longer KDE startup times ( but you will be able to work while it is loading , so you may not even notice that it is taking longer ) .
 If enabled , KDE will always try to have one preloaded Konqueror instance ready ; preloading a new instance in the background whenever there is not one available , so that windows will always open quickly . Warning : In some cases , it is actually possible that this will reduce perceived performance .
 Minimize Memory Usage
 Never
 For file browsing only ( recommended )
 Always ( use with care )
 Preloading
 Maximum number of instances kept preloaded :
 Preload an instance after KDE startup
 Always try to have at least one preloaded instance
 System Configuration
 Disable system configuration startup check
 This option may in rare cases lead to various problems . Consult the What 's This ( Shift+F1 ) help for details .

 Unable to contact the KDE smartcard service .
 Possible Reasons
 1 ) The KDE daemon , 'kded ' is not running . You can restart it by running the command 'kdeinit ' and then try reloading the KDE System Settings to see if this message goes away . 2 ) You do not appear to have smartcard support in the KDE libraries . You will need to recompile the kdelibs package with libpcsclite installed .
 Smartcard Support
 Enable smartcard support
 Enable polling to autodetect card events
 In most cases you should have this enabled . It allows KDE to automatically detect card insertion and reader hotplug events .
 Automatically launch card manager if inserted card is unclaimed
 When you insert a smartcard , KDE can automatically launch a management tool if no other application attempts to use the card .

 Menu drop-shadows are not available .
 If you check this box , you can select several effects for different widgets like combo boxes , menus or tooltips .
 Disable : do not use any combo box effects . Animate : Do some animation .

 Disable : do not use any menu effects . Animate : Do some animation . Fade : Fade in menus using alpha-blending . Make Translucent : Alpha-blend menus for a see-through effect . ( KDE styles only )
 When enabled , all popup menus will have a drop-shadow , otherwise drop-shadows will not be displayed . At present , only KDE styles can have this effect enabled .
 Software Tint : Alpha-blend using a flat color . Software Blend : Alpha-blend using an image . XRender Blend : Use the XFree RENDER extension for image blending ( if available ) . This method may be slower than the Software routines on non-accelerated displays , but may however improve performance on remote displays .
 By adjusting this slider you can control the menu effect opacity .
 Note : that all widgets in this combobox do not apply to Qt-only applications .
 If you check this box , the toolbars will be transparent when moving them around .
 If you enable this option some pop-up menus will show so called tear-off handles . If you click them , you get the menu inside a widget . This can be very helpful when performing the same action multiple times .

 kdialog : could not open file %1
 Enable background
 If this is checked , KDM will use the settings below for the background . If it is disabled , you have to look after the background yourself . This is done by running some program ( possibly xsetroot ) in the script specified in the Setup= option in kdmrc ( usually Xsetup ) .
 Attention Read help
 Enable Auto-Login
 Turn on the auto-login feature . This applies only to KDM 's graphical login . Think twice before enabling this !
 User :
 Select the user to be logged in automatically .
 Lock session
 Preselect User
 None
 Previous
 Preselect the user that logged in previously . Use this if this computer is usually used several consecutive times by one user .
 Specified :
 Preselect the user specified in the combo box to the right . Use this if this computer is predominantly used by a certain user .
 Select the user to be preselected for login . This box is editable , so you can specify an arbitrary non-existent user to mislead possible attackers .
 Focus password
 When this option is on , KDM will place the cursor in the password field instead of the user field after preselecting a user . Use this to save one key press per login , if the preselection usually does not need to be changed .
 Enable Password-Less Logins
 When this option is checked , the checked users from the list below will be allowed to log in without entering their password . This applies only to KDM 's graphical login . Think twice before enabling this !
 No password required for :
 Check all users you want to allow a password-less login for . Entries denoted with '@ ' are user groups . Checking a group is like checking all users in that group .
 Automatically log in again after X server crash
 When this option is on , a user will be logged in again automatically when their session is interrupted by an X server crash ; note that this can open a security hole : if you use a screen locker than KDE 's integrated one , this will make circumventing a password-secured screen lock possible .

 This option specifies how the users for " Show list " and " Autocompletion " are selected in the " Select users and groups " list : If not checked , select only the checked users . If checked , select all non-system users , except the checked ones .
 Sort users
 If this is checked , KDM will alphabetically sort the user list . Otherwise users are listed in the order they appear in the password file .
 Select users and groups :
 Selected Users
 KDM will show all checked users . Entries denoted with '@ ' are user groups . Checking a group is like checking all users in that group .
 Excluded Users
 KDM will show all non-checked non-system users . Entries denoted with '@ ' are user groups . Checking a group is like checking all users in that group .

 # This way you could for example mount a device # by passing 'Mount default ' as binding to # 'cdrom . desktop '
 kfmclient move 'src ' 'dest ' # Moves the URL 'src ' to 'dest ' . # 'src ' may be a list of URLs .
 kfmclient download [ 'src ' ] # Copies the URL 'src ' to a user specified location ' . # 'src ' may be a list of URLs , if not present then # a URL will be requested .
 kfmclient copy 'src ' 'dest ' # Copies the URL 'src ' to 'dest ' . # 'src ' may be a list of URLs .
 kfmclient sortDesktop # Rearranges all icons on the desktop .
 kfmclient configure # Re-read Konqueror 's configuration .
 kfmclient configureDesktop # Re-read kdesktop 's configuration .
 *** Examples : kfmclient exec file : / root/ Desktop/ cdrom . desktop " Mount default " / / Mounts the CD-ROM
 kfmclient exec file : / home/ weis/ data/ test . html / / Opens the file with default binding
 kfmclient exec file : / home/ weis/ data/ test . html Netscape / / Opens the file with netscape
 kfmclient exec ftp : / /localhost/ / / Opens new window with URL
 kfmclient exec file : / root/ Desktop/ emacs . desktop / / Starts emacs
 kfmclient exec file : / root/ Desktop/ cdrom . desktop / / Opens the CD-ROM 's mount directory
 kfmclient exec . / / Opens the current directory . Very convenient .

 Clipboard/ Selection Behavior
 Separate clipboard and selection
 This option prevents the selection being recorded in the clipboard history . Only explicit clipboard changes are recorded .
 There are two different clipboard buffers available : Clipboard is filled by selecting something and pressing Ctrl+C , or by clicking " Copy " in a toolbar or menubar . Selection is available immediately after selecting some text . The only way to access the selection is to press the middle mouse button . You can configure the relationship between Clipboard and Selection .
 Klipper - clipboard tool
 Action list ( right click to add/ remove commands ) :
 Double-click here to set the command to be executed
 Double-click here to set the regular expression
 Selecting this option synchronizes these two buffers .
 Using this option will only set the selection when highlighting something and the clipboard when choosing e. g. " Copy " in a menubar .
 Use graphical editor for editing regular expressions
 Click on a highlighted item 's column to change it . " %s " in a command will be replaced with the clipboard contents .

 Konqueror makes working with and managing your files easy . You can browse both local and networked folders while enjoying advanced features such as the powerful sidebar and file previews .

 Next : Tips Tricks
 Konqueror is designed to embrace and support Internet standards . The aim is to fully implement the officially sanctioned standards from organizations such as the W3 and OASIS , while also adding extra support for other common usability features that arise as de facto standards across the Internet . Along with this support , for such functions as favicons , Web Shortcuts , and XBEL bookmarks , Konqueror also implements :

 Tips Tricks
 Use the magnifier button in the toolbar to increase the font size on your web page .
 When you want to paste a new address into the Location toolbar you might want to clear the current entry by pressing the black arrow with the white cross in the toolbar .
 To create a link on your desktop pointing to the current page , simply drag the " Location " label that is to the left of the Location toolbar , drop it on to the desktop , and choose " Link " .
 You can also find " Full-Screen Mode " in the Settings menu . This feature is very useful for " Talk " sessions .
 Divide et impera ( lat . " Divide and conquer " ) - by splitting a window into two parts ( e. g. Window - &gt; Split View Left/ Right ) you can make Konqueror appear the way you like . You can even load some example view-profiles ( e. g. Midnight Commander ) , or create your own ones .
 Use the user-agent feature if the website you are visiting asks you to use a different browser ( and do not forget to send a complaint to the webmaster ! )
 The History in your SideBar ensures that you can keep track of the pages you have visited recently .
 Use a caching proxy to speed up your Internet connection .
 Advanced users will appreciate the Konsole which you can embed into Konqueror ( Settings - &gt; Show Terminal Emulator ) .

 Open folders in separate windows
 If this option is checked , Konqueror will open a new window when you open a folder , rather than showing that folder 's contents in the current window .
 Show file tips
 Here you can control if , when moving the mouse over a file , you want to see a small popup window with additional information about that file
 Show previews in file tips
 Here you can control if you want the popup window to contain a larger preview for the file , when moving the mouse over it
 Show 'Delete ' menu entries which bypass the trashcan
 Uncheck this if you do not want 'Delete ' menu commands to be displayed on the desktop and in the file manager 's menus and context menus . You can still delete files when hidden by holding the Shift key while calling 'Move to Trash ' .
 Standard font
 This is the font used to display text in Konqueror windows .

 Keyboard Layout Here you can choose your keyboard layout and model . The 'model ' refers to the type of keyboard that is connected to your computer , while the keyboard layout defines " which key does what " and may be different for different countries .
 Keyboard model :
 Here you can choose a keyboard model . This setting is independent of your keyboard layout and refers to the " hardware " model , i. e. the way your keyboard is manufactured . Modern keyboards that come with your computer usually have two extra keys and are referred to as " 104-key " models , which is probably what you want if you do not know what kind of keyboard you have .
 Available layouts :
 Active layouts :
 Command :
 Layout variant :
 Here you can choose a variant of selected keyboard layout . Layout variants usually represent different key maps for the same language . For example , Ukrainian layout might have four variants : basic , winkeys ( as in Windows ) , typewriter ( as in typewriters ) and phonetic ( each Ukrainian letter is placed on a transliterated latin one ) .
 Switching Options
 If you select " Application " or " Window " switching policy , changing the keyboard layout will only affect the current application or window .

 Here you can set xkb extension options instead of , or in addition to , specifying them in the X11 configuration file .
 Xkb Options
 Add &gt; &gt;
 &lt; &lt; Remove
 This is the command which is executed when switching to the selected layout . It may help you if you want to debug layout switching , or if you want to switch layouts without the help of KDE .
 Sticky Switching
 If you have more than two layouts and turn this option on , switching with the keyboard shortcut or clicking on the kxkb indicator will only cycle through the last few layouts . You can specify the number of layouts to rotate below . You can still access all layouts by right-clicking on the kxkb indicator .

 Options
 If more than one layout is present in this list , the KDE panel will offer a docked flag . By clicking on this flag you can easily switch between layouts . The first layout will be default one .
 Keymap
 This is the list of available keyboard layouts in your system . You can add a layout to the active list by selecting it and pressing " Add " button .
 If you check this option , pressing and holding down a key emits the same character over and over again . For example , pressing and holding down the Tab key will have the same effect as that of pressing that key several times in succession : Tab characters continue to be emitted until you release the key .
 Enable keyboard repeat
 Delay :
 If supported , this option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes . The 'Repeat rate ' option controls the frequency of these keycodes .
 Rate :
 If supported , this option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed .
 If supported , this option allows you to setup the state of NumLock after KDE startup . You can configure NumLock to be turned on or off , or configure KDE not to set NumLock state .

 The goal of the game is to put 5 balls of the same color in line .
 You can make horizontal , vertical and diagonal lines .
 Each turn , three new balls are placed on the board .
 Every turn , you can move one ball .
 To move a ball , click on it with the mouse , then click where you want the ball to go .
 You just moved the blue ball !
 Balls can be moved to every position on the board , as long as there are no other balls in their way .
 Now we only need one more blue ball .
 It seems to be our lucky day !
 Now you try ! Click on the green ball and move it to the others !
 Almost , try again !
 Very good !
 Whenever you complete a line you get an extra turn .
 This is the end of this tutorial . Feel free to finish the game !

 Cannot Initiate the %1 Protocol
 Unable to Launch Process
 The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol could not be started . This is usually due to technical reasons .
 The program which provides compatibility with this protocol may not have been updated with your last update of KDE . This can cause the program to be incompatible with the current version and thus not start .
 Internal Error
 The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an internal error .
 Improperly Formatted URL
 The U niform R esource L ocator ( URL ) that you entered was not properly formatted . The format of a URL is generally as follows : protocol : / /user : password@www . example . org : port/ folder/ filename . extension ? query=value
 Unsupported Protocol %1
 The protocol %1 is not supported by the KDE programs currently installed on this computer .
 The requested protocol may not be supported .
 The versions of the %1 protocol supported by this computer and the server may be incompatible .
 You may perform a search on the Internet for a KDE program ( called a kioslave or ioslave ) which supports this protocol . Places to search include http : / /kde-apps . org/ and http : / /freshmeat . net/ .
 URL Does Not Refer to a Resource .
 Protocol is a Filter Protocol
 The U niform R esource L ocator ( URL ) that you entered did not refer to a specific resource .

 Folder Listing Unavailable
 Protocol %1 is not a Filesystem
 This means that a request was made which requires determining the contents of the folder , and the KDE program supporting this protocol is unable to do so .
 Cyclic Link Detected
 UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location . KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was ( perhaps in a roundabout way ) linked to itself .
 Delete one part of the loop in order that it does not cause an infinite loop , and try again .
 Request Aborted By User
 The request was not completed because it was aborted .
 Retry the request .
 Cyclic Link Detected During Copy

 Although a connection was established to %1 , the connection was closed at an unexpected point in the communication .
 A protocol error may have occurred , causing the server to close the connection as a response to the error .
 URL Resource Invalid
 Protocol %1 is not a Filter Protocol
 The U niform R esource L ocator ( URL ) that you entered did not refer to a valid mechanism of accessing the specific resource , %1%2 .

 Specifies the phone numbers to dial . You can supply multiple numbers here , simply click on " Add " . You can arrange the order the numbers are tried by using the arrow buttons . When a number is busy or fails , kppp will try the next number and so on
 Authentication :
 Script-based
 PAP
 Terminal-based
 CHAP
 PAP/ CHAP
 Specifies the method used to identify yourself to the PPP server . Most universities still use Terminal- or Script-based authentication , while most ISP use PAP and/ or CHAP . If unsure , contact your ISP . If you can choose between PAP and CHAP , choose CHAP , because it is much safer . If you do not know whether PAP or CHAP is right , choose PAP/ CHAP .
 Store password
 When this is turned on , your ISP password will be saved in kppp 's config file , so you do not need to type it in every time . Warning : your password will be stored as plain text in the config file , which is readable only to you . Make sure nobody gains access to this file !

 Before connect :
 Allows you to run a program before a connection is established . It is called immediately before dialing has begun . This might be useful , e. g. to stop HylaFAX blocking the modem .
 Upon connect :
 Allows you to run a program after a connection is established . When your program is called , all preparations for an Internet connection are finished . Very useful for fetching mail and news
 Before disconnect :
 Allows you to run a program before a connection is closed . The connection will stay open until the program exits .
 Upon disconnect :
 Allows you to run a program after a connection has been closed .
 Configuration
 Dynamic IP address
 Select this option when your computer gets an internet address ( IP ) every time a connection is made . Almost every Internet Service Provider uses this method , so this should be turned on .
 Static IP address
 Select this option when your computer has a fixed internet address ( IP ) . Most computers do not have one , so you should probably select dynamic IP addressing unless you know what you are doing .
 IP address :
 If your computer has a permanent internet address , you must supply your IP address here .
 Subnet mask :
 If your computer has a static Internet address , you must supply a network mask here . In almost all cases this netmask will be 255.255.255.0 , but your mileage may vary . If unsure , contact your Internet Service Provider
 Auto-configure hostname from this IP
 Whenever you connect , this reconfigures your hostname to match the IP address you got from the PPP server . This may be useful if you need to use a protocol which depends on this information , but it can also cause several problems . Do not enable this unless you really need it .
 Selecting this option might cause some weird problems with the X-server and applications while kppp is connected . Do not use it unless you know what you are doing . For more information take a look at the handbook ( or help ) in the " Frequently asked questions " section .
 Domain name :
 If you enter a domain name here , this domain name is used for your computer while you are connected . When the connection is closed , the original domain name of your computer is restored . If you leave this field blank , no changes are made to the domain name .
 Configuration :
 Automatic
 Manual
 DNS IP address :
 Allows you to specify a new DNS server to be used while you are connected . When the connection is closed , this DNS entry will be removed again . To add a DNS server , type in the IP address of the DNS server here and click on Add
 Add
 Click this button to add the DNS server specified in the field above . The entry will then be added to the list below
 Click this button to remove the selected DNS server entry from the list below
 DNS address list :
 This shows all defined DNS servers to use while you are connected . Use the Add and Remove buttons to modify the list
 Disable existing DNS servers during connection
 When this option is selected , all DNS servers specified in / etc/ resolv . conf are temporary disabled while the dialup connection is established . After the connection is closed , the servers will be re-enabled Typically , there is no reason to use this option , but it may become useful under some circumstances .
 Default gateway
 This makes the PPP peer computer ( the computer you are connected to with your modem ) to act as a gateway . Your computer will send all packets not going to a computer inside your local net to this computer , which will route these packets . This is the default for most ISPs , so you should probably leave this option on .
 Static gateway
 Allows you to specify which computer you want to use as gateway ( see Default Gateway above )
 Gateway IP address :
 Assign the default route to this gateway
 If this option is enabled , all packets not going to the local net are routed through the PPP connection . Normally , you should turn this on
 Insert
 Add Phone Number
 Enter a phone number :
 pppd version :
 pppd timeout :
 sec
 kppp will wait this number of seconds to see if a PPP connection is established . If no connection is made in this time frame , kppp will give up and kill pppd .
 Dock into panel on connect
 After a connection is established , the window is minimized and a small icon in the KDE panel represents this window . Clicking on this icon will restore the window to its original location and size .
 Automatic redial on disconnect
 When a connection is established and it somehow gets disconnected , kppp will try to reconnect to the same account . See here for more on this topic .
 Automatic redial on NO CARRIER
 Show clock on caption
 When this option is checked , the window title shows the time since a connection was established . Very useful , so you should turn this on
 Disconnect on X server shutdown
 Checking this option will close any open connection when the X-server is shut down . You should enable this option unless you know what you are doing . See here for more on this .
 Quit on disconnect
 When this option is turned on , kppp will be closed when you disconnect
 Minimize window on connect
 Iconifies kppp 's window when a connection is established
 Modem name :
 Type in a unique name for this modem
 Modem device :
 This specifies the serial port your modem is attached to . On Linux/ x86 , typically this is either / dev/ ttyS0 ( COM1 under DOS ) or / dev/ ttyS1 ( COM2 under DOS ) . If you have an internal ISDN card with AT command emulation ( most cards under Linux support this ) , you should select one of the / dev/ ttyIx devices .
 Flow control :
 Specifies how the serial port and modem communicate . You should not change this unless you know what you are doing . Default : CRTSCTS
 Line termination :
 Specifies how AT commands are sent to your modem . Most modems will work fine with the default CR/ LF . If your modem does not react to the init string , you should try different settings here Default : CR/ LF
 Connection speed :
 Specifies the speed your modem and the serial port talk to each other . You should begin with at least 115200 bits/ sec ( or more if you know that your serial port supports higher speeds ) . If you have connection problems , try to reduce this value .
 Use lock file
 To prevent other programs from accessing the modem while a connection is established , a file can be created to indicate that the modem is in use . On Linux an example file would be / var/ lock/ LCK. . ttyS1 Here you can select whether this locking will be done . Default : On
 Modem timeout :
 This specifies how long kppp waits for a CONNECT response from your modem . The recommended value is 30 seconds .
 Wait for dial tone before dialing
 Normally the modem waits for a dial tone from your phone line , indicating that it can start to dial a number . If your modem does not recognize this sound , or your local phone system does not emit such a tone , uncheck this option Default : : On
 Busy wait :
 Specifies the number of seconds to wait before redial if all dialed numbers are busy . This is necessary because some modems get stuck if the same number is busy too often . The default is 0 seconds , you should not change this unless you need to .
 Modem volume :
 Most modems have a speaker which makes a lot of noise when dialing . Here you can either turn this completely off or select a lower volume . If this does not work for your modem , you must modify the modem volume command .
 Modem asserts CD line
 This controls how kppp detects that the modem is not responding . Unless you are having problems with this , do not modify this setting . Default : Off
 Modem Commands ...
 Allows you to change the AT command for your modem .
 Query Modem ...
 Most modems support the ATI command set to find out vendor and revision of your modem . Press this button to query your modem for this information . It can be useful to help you set up the modem
 Terminal ...
 Opens the built-in terminal program . You can use this if you want to play around with your modem 's AT command set

 Notice that the remote system has sent the following message : " %1 " This may give you a hint why the connection has failed .
 Unable to provide help .
 KPPP could not prepare a PPP log . It is very likely that pppd was started without the " debug " option . Without this option it is difficult to find out PPP problems , so in general the debug option should be used . Enable debug now , and restart pppd ?

 You can swap the characters on each side of the cursor just by pressing Ctrl+T
 You can export the current document as a HTML file , including syntax highlighting . Just choose File -gt ; Export -gt ; HTML ...
 You can split the Kate editor as many times as you like and in either direction . Each frame has its own status bar and can display any open document . Just choose View -gt ; Split [ Horizontal _ Vertical ]
 You can drag the Tool views ( File List and File Selector ) to any side that you want them in Kate , or stack them , or even tear them off the main window .
 Kate has a built-in terminal emulator , just click on " Terminal " at the bottom to show or hide it as you desire .
 Kate can highlight the current line with a different background color . _ You can set the color in the Colors page of the configuration dialog .
 You can open the currently edited file in any other application from within Kate . Choose File -gt ; Open With for the list of programs configured for the document type . There is also an option Other ... to choose any application on your system .
 You can configure the editor to always display the line numbers and/ or bookmark panes when started from the View Defaults page of the configuration dialog .
 You can download new or updated Syntax highlight definitions from the Highlighting page in the configuration dialog . Just click the Download ... button on the Open/ Save -gt ; Modes Filetypes tab ( You have to be online , of course ... ) .
 You can cycle through all open documents by pressing Alt+Left or Alt+Right . The next/ previous document will immediately be displayed in the active frame .
 You can do cool sed-like regular expression replacements using Command Line . For example , press F7 and enter s / oldtext/ newtext/ g to replace quot ; oldtextquot ; with quot ; newtextquot ; throughout the current line .
 You can repeat your last search by just pressing F3 , or Shift+F3 if you want to search backwards .
 You can filter the files displayed in the File Selector tool view . Simply enter your filter in the filter entry at the bottom , for example : * . html * . php if you only want to see HTML and PHP files in the current folder . The File Selector will even remember your filters for you .
 You can have two views - or even more - of the same document in Kate . Editing in either will be reflected in both . So if you find yourself scrolling up and down to look at text at the other end of a document , just press Ctrl+Shift+T to split horizontally .
 Press F8 or Shift+F8 to switch to the next/ previous frame .

 These options allow you to have the File Selector automatically change location to the folder of the active document on certain events . Auto synchronization is lazy , meaning it will not take effect until the file selector is visible . None of these are enabled by default , but you can always sync the location by pressing the sync button in the toolbar .
 If this option is enabled ( default ) , the location will be restored when you start Kate . Note that if the session is handled by the KDE session manager , the location is always restored .

 Crop picture to edges
 Do n't export extra blank space to file
 Crop picture to edges This will eliminate all blank portions of the drawing . The picture will only be as large as the stencils it contains . If your stencils are located in the upper right corner of the page , then only the upper right corner will be exported .
 Quality :
 The higher the quality , the more space the file takes up
 Quality Not all file formats use this . But for those that do , this affects the quality of the image that gets exported . 100 is the maximum quality . The higher the number , the better the picture looks . The downside is the higher the number , the larger the filesize .
 An optional border of whitespace around the page , in pixels
 Border Places a blank border around the edges of the image . This can be used if for one reason or another , the stencils do n't fit into the export page with a 0-pixel border ( default ) .

 Autocorrection
 Simple Autocorrection
 Detect when a new sentence is started and always ensure that the first character is an uppercase character .
 Convert two uppercase characters to one uppercase and one lowercase character ( e. g. PErfect to Perfect )
 Detect when a URL ( Uniform Resource Locator ) is typed and provide formatting that matches the way an Internet browser would show a URL .
 Suppress double spaces
 Remove spaces at the beginning and end of paragraphs
 Automatically do bold and underline formatting
 When typing '1 ) ' or similar in front of a paragraph , automatically convert the paragraph to use that numbering style . This has the advantage that further paragraphs will also be numbered and the spacing is done correctly .
 Replace 1st ... with 1^st ...
 When typing '* ' or '- ' in front of a paragraph , automatically convert the paragraph to use that list-style . Using a list-style formatting means that a correct bullet is used to draw the list .
 Custom Quotes
 Replace double quotes with typographical quotes
 Replace single quotes with typographical quotes

 The BITAND( ) function performs a bit-wise AND operation for the two integer parameters .
 BITAND(value ; value )
 The BITLSHIFT( ) function performs a bit-wise left shift operation of the first parameter . The number of bits to shift by is specified by the second parameter . Note that a negative number of bits to left shift by becomes a right shift .
 The BITRSHIFT( ) function performs a bit-wise right shift operation of the first parameter . The number of bits to shift by is specified by the second parameter . Note that a negative number of bits to right shift by becomes a left shift .
 BITOR(value ; value )
 The BITXOR( ) function performs a bit-wise exclusive-OR operation for the two integer parameters .
 Bool value to convert
 The BOOL2STRING( ) function returns a string value for a given boolean value . This method is intended for using a boolean in methods which require a string
 BOOL2STRING(value )
 BOOL2STRING(true ) returns " True "
 BOOL2STRING(false ) returns " False "
 Integer value to convert
 The INT2BOOL( ) function returns a boolean value for a given integer number . This method is intended for using an integer in methods which require a boolean . It only accepts 0 or 1. If any other value is given , false is returned .
 INT2BOOL(value )
 INT2BOOL(1 ) returns true
 The BOOL2INT( ) function returns an integer value for a given boolean value . This method is intended for using a boolean value in methods which require an integer .
 The NUM2STRING( ) function returns a string value for a given number . Note that KSpread can auto-convert numbers to strings if needed , so this function should rarely be needed .
 NUM2STRING(value )
 NUM2STRING(10 ) returns " 10 "
 NUM2STRING(2.05 ) returns " 2.05 "
 Value in X
 Value in Y
 The POLR( ) function returns the radius corresponding to the position of a point in a cartesian landmark .
 POLR(X ; Y )
 POLR(12 ; 12 ) returns 16.9705
 POLR(12 ; 0 ) returns 12
 The POLA( ) function returns the angle ( in radians ) corresponding to the position of a point in a cartesian landmark .
 POLA(X ; Y )
 POLA(12 ; 12 ) returns 0.78539816
 POLA(12 ; 0 ) returns 0
 POLA(0 ; 12 ) returns 1.5707
 Radius
 Angle ( radians )
 The CARX( ) function returns the X position corresponding to the position of a point in a polar landmark .
 CARX(Radius ; Angle )
 CARX(12 ; 1.5707 ) returns 0.00115592
 CARX(12 ; 0 ) returns 12

 Editorial
 In this edition of Justice Today, the first of 2009, we look back on a decade of achievements made by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.
 The Department aims to uphold and protect the Constitution and the rule of law and to render accessible, fair, speedy and cost effective administration of Justice, in the interests of a safer and more secure South Africa.
 Major strides have been made over the past ten years to bring this aim into reality, and thus improve the lives of our people.
 Much has been achieved and more is planned in the future
 in areas such as providing the required capacity for the
 courts and restructuring these facilities, as they form part
 of the coalface of justice service delivery.
 In this edition, we
 unpack the Redesignation of branch courts, a project which
 aims to bring justice services closer to those in rural and
 township areas.
 Another project closely linked to restructuring and
 transformation of the courts, is the pilot project on the use
 of indigenous languages. Across the country cases have
 been heard in Zulu, Xhosa, Setswana and Afrikaans, in
 This is a major accomplishment and a much needed
 intervention for communities which had faced challenges
 regarding the language barrier in courts. Justice Today
 has followed this project and we explain why it is needed
 and just how deep its impact will be on widening access to
 justice.
 Yet another major accomplishment in the past decade,
 improving the maintenance system to relieve the pressure
 on the courts. We explain the groundbreaking work done in
 this field through Operation Isondlo, as well as the tireless
 efforts of Maintenance Investigators. This issue also looks
 at other departmental endeavours of the past decade and
 more in protecting the vulnerable. These include the work
 of the Family Advocate such as implementing the Hague
 Convention on International Parental Abductions,
 prioritising children in the justice system and the rights of
 Looking to the future, the draft Criminal Law (Forensic
 Procedure) Amendment Bill will give government
 departments shared access to
 millions fingerprints and DNA,
 which will assist in a major way in
 crime solving.
 We at Justice Today look forward
 to yet another decade of justice
 achievements, during which we
 will be at hand to share this news
 with you and help to educate the
 nation on how these strides in
 justice can be access and make
 a difference in their lives. Lavinia Mahlangu

 Justice services are coming a step
 closer to the homes of South Africaâs
 most vulnerable, through the conversion
 service courts. According to Minister
 of Justice and Constitutional Development
 Enver Surty, this will improve Access
 to Justice for many communities
 and for women in particular.
 courts transformed into full service
 courts, presiding over civil matters such
 as maintenance and divorce, in addition
 to the criminal matters which have
 always been processed there. Speaking
 to the Bloemfontein High Court
 bench last year, Minister Surty said
 the re designated courts would benefit
 women as they will be able to receive
 maintenance payments close to their
 homes.
 Using the people of Alexandra as an
 example, the Minister explained that
 this community, which comprises a
 third of the regionâs population, had to
 travel quite a distance into Randburg,
 to receive civil court services. Through
 Alexandra will now offer those services
 and alleviate that problem.
 There is poor public transport between many townships and rural areas, in relation
 to the bigger towns, where the main courts are. Because of this, many people
 endure a great deal of hardship to reach the main courts to access civil services.
 For example people residing in Deben in the Northern Cape, have to travel 111km
 to Postmasburg, while those from Bolotwa must travel 65km to the nearest branch
 court in Lady Frere in the Eastern Cape. Through this initiative such challenges
 Part of the outcome of the project is to promote accessibility to all the courts by
 extending all services to branch courts. This is in order to improve service delivery
 to those communities. It is the vision of the Department to establish courts closer
 to the previously disadvantaged communities.
 Addressing historical imbalances
 Under the previous government, the majority of court districts were geared to
 serve the White minority and Black communities in the townships were marginalised.
 They could only access services at the branch and periodical courts, which
 provided services at a lower standard compared to the better resourced courts in
 the cities and towns.
 Branch courts were established to deal only with criminal cases. The creation
 of the majority of branch courts in the former Black townships with only criminal
 jurisdiction suggested that criminality resorted largely within these areas.
 Periodical courts were treated the same. The fact that no civil cases or other services,
 such as maintenance and domestic violence, were provided at these courts
 limits access to justice for which these courts were established.
 Since 1994 several new courts were built in densely populated areas to bring
 services closer to the people. New courts are required in other densely populated
 areas such as Diepsloot, and Orange Farm in Gauteng, Sundumbile (Eshowe)
 in KwaZulu-Natal; Mondlo (Nqutu) in KwaZulu-Natal; Vivo (Soutpansberg) in
 Western Cape.
 Some of the old courts were built far away from the communities to be at strategic
 points, such as entry points or next to main routes for the convenience of
 the magistrates and prosecutors, who were formerly White and came outside the
 township where the court is situated.
 Redesignation of Courts:
 Bringing justice closer to home
 By Lavinia Mahlangu and
 Motshidisi Baloyi
 Minister of Justice and
 Constitutional Development
 Enver Surty
 Citizens in rural areas and many townships travel long distances to the nearest
 courts for services such as maintenance. Soon this will be a thing of the past.
 04
 In the case of Periodical Courts, services are rendered once
 communities are deprived of access to justice in relation to
 civil and family disputes.
 Of the 230 Periodical Courts, 116 are established in police
 stations and prisons. This policy was promoted during the
 pre 1994 constitutional era and it was intended for the
 The Constitution protects the right of everyone to have
 any dispute that can be resolved by application of the
 law, to be decided in the fair public hearing before a
 court. Holding of a court in the police station, prison or
 private farm may compromise the right to a fair trial.
 When the Constitution took effect in February 1997, it
 was part of the transitional arrangement that all courts
 existing at that time continued to function as they had been, subject to any amendment or repeal of the applicable legislation.
 However, it was also set down that soon after the new Constitution took effect, these courts, including their structure,
 composition, functioning and jurisdiction must be transformed. This would be with a view of establishing a judicial system
 suited to the requirements of the new Constitution.
 Phases of the project
 The process of the re-alignment of the areas of jurisdiction of the courts is part of the rationalisation of the jurisdiction of the
 courts mandated by the Constitution. The approach to this process is undertaken through two sub-projects namely:
 â¢ The re-determination of magisterial areas of jurisdiction for the Lower Courts (commonly referred to as the re-demarcation
 of magisterial districts); and
 â¢ The rationalisation of the areas of jurisdiction of the divisions of the High Court

 Phase 3
 The remaining three Branch Courts in
 Gauteng require infrastructure upgrade,
 namely Orlando, Protea and
 Tsakane, before they are considered
 for re-designation as main courts.
 Training magistrates to preside over
 civil matters
 However, these strides in Access to

 judiciary,â said Minister Surty at his
 meeting with the Free State judiciary.
 âWhat is more substantial is how we
 Most magistrates are not experienced

 have to draw on the training provided
 by the Justice College, identify regions

 said Minister Surty.
 To give effect to the conversion of the

 response to the request of the Minister,
 the Magistrates Commission has submitted
 a report where it recommends

 jurisdictions to be aligned with the municipal
 boundaries. This will promote an
 integrated approach to providing justice
 services. The alignment of services of
 different departments at municipal level
 is intended to promote integrated and
 effective provision of public services.
 The relationship between municipal
 boundaries and magisterial boundaries
 is of significance in the determination of
 magisterial areas of jurisdiction for the
 Lower Courts. Prior to 1994 municipal
 boundaries largely followed the demarcation
 of magisterial boundaries.
 At that time there were 814 municipalities
 and the boundaries of most of the
 municipalities corresponded with those
 of the magisterial boundaries. Initially
 the municipalities were rationalised into
 237 new municipalities by the Municipal
 Demarcation Board. In 2005 the
 Challenges such as distance to towns and public transport costs will no longer stand
 in the way of citizens accessing justice, as courts will be at their doorstep.
 Constitution Twelfth Amendment Act
 was passed to eliminate cross boundary
 municipalities in instances where
 municipal boundaries of a particular
 municipality stretched across the
 boundary of another province.
 Thereafter, the municipalities were further
 rationalised to establish the current
 187 municipalities.
 The criteria used by the Municipal
 Demarcation Board in the rationalisation
 of municipalities are relevant to
 the determination of magisterial areas
 of jurisdiction for the Lower Courts,
 municipalities.
 These criteria include the size of the
 population, public transport, availability
 of other public facilities (schools, hospitals),
 developmental plans and potential
 growth. The integration of services
 provided by other government departments,
 through their different clusters is
 also an important factor.

 Indigenous languages in courts
 Justice speaks your language
 In 2008 the Department of Justice and Constitutional
 pilot project to promote the use of indigenous
 languages in courts. This project will ensure
 that there is equal access to justice for all
 vulnerable.
 The department aims to make justice accessible
 to all South Africans, in line with the
 languages. In the past, court proceedings were
 heard only in English and Afrikaans. The use
 of indigenous languages serves not only to encourage
 linguistic diversity but also to promote
 access to justice and put citizens more at ease
 in courts.
 The pilot project is expected to proceed for approximately
 already started and others identified the courts
 and court rooms as well as the dominant indigenous
 languages to be used.
 Regions and stakeholders had to determine
 which indigenous language was suitable for
 the respective provinces. This was based
 on inputs received at consultative forums. In
 some provinces two to three languages are
 being piloted simultaneously.
 These include Western Cape (isiXhosa and
 Afrikaans), Northern Cape (Setswana and
 and Limpopo (XiTsonga, TshiVenda and
 Sepedi). This was to ensure that all litigants
 are comfortable with the language they will
 use in court. The criteria will assist where the
 province has a large size of population speaking
 different indigenous languages.
 The project became a reality when the
 Provincial Integrated Justice Forum (PIJF) of
 KwaZulu-Natal identified Msinga Magistrateâs
 Court as a pilot site for the project. Msinga
 Magistrateâs Court was selected because it is
 situated in a rural area where most litigants
 speak isiZulu. The first case was heard on 30
 January 2009. In the Eastern Cape, cases
 have been heard in Xhosa, following the
 launch of the new service at the Zwelitsha
 Magistrateâs Court on 20 February 2009. On
 24 February 2009 the North West Province
 witnessed its first courts proceedings
 conducted through Setswana as an indigenous
 language.
 The Western Cape launched its use of indigenous
 language in Khayelitsha Magistrate
 court on 2 March 2009. The court proceedings
 were conducted in isiXhosa. Two courts have
 been set up in Mitchells Plain, where Afrikaans
 is used as an indigenous language. Some
 launches will be taking place throughout the
 other provinces.
 The project aims at using local languages
 as the language of record in our courts. This
 will take place in areas where the magistrate,
 language. It will contribute to decreasing court
 backlogs and developing a culture of understanding,
 tolerance and dialogue in our courts.
 The project will kick-off in these courts with more to follow:

 Paja Rules see the light of day
 A Victory For Ordinary Citizens
 By J.B. Skosana
 Section 33(1) of the Constitution guarantees everyone the
 right to administrative action that is lawful, reasonable
 and procedurally fair.
 The Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, 2000 gives
 effect to that right. Section 7 of the Act requires the Rules
 Board for Courts of Law to make rules of procedure for judicial
 review subject to the approval of Parliament while section
 6 of the Rules Board for Courts of Law Act, 1985 (Act
 No. 107 of 1985), requires the Rules Board to make rules of
 court subject to the approval of the Minister.
 After a protracted process of consultation, exchange of
 2003, the rules were finally drafted and approved by Parliament
 on 20 February 2009. Thanks to the decisive intervention
 by the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development,
 Enver Surty.
 The Minister established a task team led by his special
 adviser, Mr Halton Cheadle, and consisted of the designated
 members of the Rules Board and the Department. The
 Justice Portfolio Committee assigned one of its members to
 work with the team.
 The Minister gave them the task team four months (November
 2008 â February 2009) to accomplish the task. Not
 underscored the importance of the spirit of cooperative governance
 in the process of rule making between the judiciary,
 the executive and Parliament.
 The rules specify the procedure and the forms that must be
 filled in order to: request reasons for an administrative action
 or decision where the rights of a person are materially and
 adversely affected by such a decisionrequest for disclosure
 of documents where a person intends to institute an application
 for judicial review application for judicial review by a
 court, including a magistrateâs court In the absence of these
 rules a person could only apply to the High Court for judicial
 review in terms of rule 53 of the High Court, which can be
 very costly and complex.
 Some of the common examples of decisions that will reviewable
 in terms of these rules are: refusal of application for old
 age/child/disability grantrefuse liquor licence or any license
 of trade, fire arm license Refusal of passport
 The rules have been written in a simple language and accompanied
 by easy-to-complete forms (with have explanatory
 notes on the margins). The rules are accessible on the
 Departmentâs website and will be published in the Gazette
 will come into operation.
 This will be soon after the necessary capacity, including the
 training of judicial officers on the rules has taken place.
 The long wait has eventually paid off for all citizens,
 especially the indigent and the poor who would not have the
 means to approach High Court for a remedy.
 The PAJA rules are in simple language,
 accompanied by easy to complete forms.

 briefing on 3 December 2008.
 The draft Criminal Law (Forensic
 Procedure) Amendment Bill will
 make provision for the SAPS to
 access the Home Affairs National
 Identification System (HANIS), which
 contains the fingerprints of 31 million
 foreigners.
 The SAPS will also have access to the
 National Traffic Information System (E-Natis)
 of the Department of Transport, where a further 6 million
 thumbprints are located. This will help in criminal investigations
 purposes and the expansion of the SAPSâ powers to take and
 retain fingerprints.
 The current Criminal Procedure Act does not make the taking of
 fingerprints compulsory, even in instances where a person has
 been convicted of an offence. It also requires the destruction of
 fingerprints, palm prints, footprints, photographs and the record
 of steps taken to obtain such evidence if a person is found notguilty
 or if no prosecution was instituted against a person from
 whom such evidence was collected.
 Justice and Constitutional Development Minister Enver Surty
 said this meant fingerprints collected at a crime scene would
 probably only be checked against those of the limited number of
 convicted criminals on the police database. It is for this reason,
 according to the Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional
 By Neliswa Demana
 The implementation of the Bill will see departments sharing forensic information, such as fingerprint, DNA, photographs
 and identity documents in order to fight crime.
 A fingerprint database will
 help the fight against crime.
 The Bill was developed by the Department of Justice and
 Constitutional Development in consultation with the SAPS,
 National Prosecuting Authority, Departments of
 Correctional Services, Home Affairs, Transport, the National
 Treasury and the DNA Project.
 The financial implications for
 the State have been costed
 and a business plan has
 been developed to map the
 implementation of the Bill.
 Justice and Constitutional
 Development Adv De Lange
 explained that billions of
 rands would be used to
 establish a DNA database,
 samples from convicted
 criminals and would also
 be used as a tool to solve
 crimes.
 January/February 2009 Justice Today l 09
 The advantages of a strengthened forensic crime
 fighting capacity are:
 1. A DNA database and an expanded fingerprint capacity
 are important intelligence tools, particularly
 in crimes where detection is generally low, such as
 property crimes and can lead to a significant increase
 in suspect-to-crime-scene matches.
 2. DNA scene-to-scene matches help identify patterns
 of criminal behaviour that may help solve past, existing
 and future crimes.
 In other words, not only will an expanded fingerprint
 database and DNA database increase the likelihood
 of identifying unknown perpetrators, but it will also
 increase the possibility of linking perpetrators to multiple
 crime scenes.
 3. The Bill will help reduce backlogs because plea bargains
 will increase when suspects are confronted with
 real evidence, such as fingerprints and DNA evidence
 linking them to a crime scene.
 4. It should also always be borne in mind that fingerprints
 and especially DNA evidence are used not only
 to prove guilt, but also to prove innocence.
 In addition, Cabinet has approved for speedy and
 immediate implementation of the Bail Protocol on the
 Procedure to be followed in applying section 63A of
 the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 âThis protocol
 allows the court, on application by a Head of a Prison
 and if not opposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions
 concerned, to order the release of certain accused persons
 on warning in lieu of bail or to order the amendment of bail
 conditions,â Mr Maseko explained. Cabinet has also
 approved the proposal to implement an integrated, seamless
 and national criminal justice business information
 system. All departments and agencies in the criminal justice
 âThis work will be coordinated by the Office for Criminal
 Justice System Reform (OCJSR) which reports to the
 Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional
 Development,â said the Government Spokesperson.
 Fingerprints and DNA evidence are used not only to prove guilt, but also to prove innocence.

 Children are top priority in
 changing justice system
 A critical part of the governmentâs bid to change the justice system
 of children. By 1 April 2010, the country will have its first ever Child
 Justice Act, a law that tries to balance the rights of victims with the
 reality that juvenile offenders are the adults of tomorrow and have
 at all costs to be rehabilitated â not made worse.
 But the Bill, recently passed by Parliament, is not inspired by
 philanthropy but by our Constitution and international treaties and
 laws concerning children that South Africa either subscribes to or
 is party to. One of the concerns is that current criminal laws do not
 There isnât much middle ground â children either get jail sentences
 or suspended sentences. They are brought to court much like
 adults, and exposed to all the bad aspects of the current system â
 including adult criminal suspects and convicts .
 A central feature of the Bill is the diversion of matters away from the
 formal justice system in appropriate cases. One of the main objectives
 of diverson is to promote the childâs re-integration into the
 community and reduce potential re-offending. The Bill also seeks to
 balance the best interests of the child and society, with due regard
 to the victimâs rights.
 And, if children have to be detained, then they need to be detained
 in facilities appropriate to their age â away from adult criminals. The
 problem of course, is that there arenât many non-custodial options
 available, nor the people or resources to manage them, which is
 why the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development
 (DoJCD) has launched a pilot project in five cities; Randburg in
 Gauteng; Odi in North-West; Bellville in the Western Cape; East
 London in the Eastern Cape; and, Kimberley in the Northern Cape.
 There, DoJCD officials are working with the Department of
 Correctional Services, NICRO (the National Institute for Crime
 Prevention and the Rehabilitation of Offenders), schools, the
 provincial departments of education, the National Prosecuting Authority
 (NPA), the police, legal aid and local communities. Together,
 they are looking for alternative punishments, especially diversion
 programmes with social workers and therapists.
 Diversion is closely linked to restorative justice. Offenders take
 responsibility for their crimes and make amends. In doing this, they
 start a process of healing for their victims, themselves, their families
 and the broader community.
 The diversion programmes develop life skills in young offenders
 as an alternative to being jailed. In terms of the pilot project, young
 suspects who commit offences, will be charged and appear in court.
 They will then be investigated by a probation officer who will check
 with NICRO if they are suitable for a non-custodial programme.
 Offenders will not be considered for a diversion programme unless
 they voluntarily admit to the crime. The offender will be checked
 on by a probation officer, who will submit progress reports to court.
 NICRO will then continue to track and evaluate progress, in close
 consultation with the probation officer. The pilot programme is
 scheduled to take a year, after which it will be rolled out to all magisterial
 districts across the country.
 The end result should be a much fairer system and a dramatic drop
 in the number of juvenile prisoners, sitting in prison with no access
 to formal education for minor offences that could have been far
 better dealt with in a number of ways. Most importantly the cycle
 of crime will have been broken and young offenders should not
 develop into hardened adult criminals which is generally the case if
 they land up in prison.

 Promotion of Equality and Prevention of
 Unfair Discrimination Act
 By Zimkhitha Sondlo
 The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 required
 legislation to be enacted to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination
 within three years of commencement of the Constitution. As
 a result, Parliament passed as law the Promotion of Equality and
 Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act No 4 of 2000 (PEPUDA
 widely known as âEquality Actâ).
 The Equality Act facilitates the transition to democratic society,
 united in its diversity, marked by human relations that are caring
 and compassionate, and guided by the principles of equality, fairness,
 equity, social progress, justice, human dignity and freedom.
 It places a positive duty on the state and all persons (including
 institutions) to promote equality.
 The main objectives of this Act are:
 â¢ To prohibit and prevent unfair discrimination;
 â¢ To prohibit and prevent hate speech;
 â¢ To prevent harassment;
 â¢ To promote equality; and
 â¢ To provide recourse for victims of unfair discrimination, hate
 speech and harassment.
 UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION, HATE SPEECH AND HARRASMENT
 Unfair discrimination
 Unfair discrimination is when you are treated differently as
 compared to other categories of people and that your dignity as
 a human being is impaired by such treatment. Discrimination is
 regarded as unfair when it imposes burden or withholds benefits
 or opportunities from any person on one or more of the following
 prohibited grounds: sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience,
 belief, culture language and birth etc, or any other ground
 where discrimination based on that other ground negatively affects
 the equal enjoyment of a personâs rights and freedoms in a serious
 manner that is comparable to discrimination on the prohibited
 grounds.
 It must be noted that discrimination is not always unfair, for
 instance discrimination is fair if it is established that the differentiation
 is applied to:
 (a) promote the achievement of substantive equality
 (equality of outcome) and
 (b) to protect and advance persons disadvantaged by
 unfair discrimination.
 Hate speech
 Hate speech is the publishing, spreading or communication of
 words that are based on one or more of the prohibited grounds.
 These words must be reasonably construed to demonstrate a clear
 intention to hurt, harm or to incite harm and to promote or propagate
 hatred.
 Harassment
 Harassment is the unwanted conduct (behavior) which persists or
 which is serious and disgraceful or create an intimidating environment,
 or is intended to cause submission by actual or threatened
 negative consequences and which is related to, amongst others,
 sex, gender, or sexual orientation. It will therefore be harassment if
 for example if a person is intimidating you because he or she does
 not approve your sexual orientation, e.g. if you are gay or lesbian.
 What are Equality Courts and where to find them?
 Equality Courts are the courts designated specifically in terms of
 the Equality Act to hear cases relating to unfair discrimination, hate
 speech and harassment.They are accessible, informal and participatory
 These courts are aimed at eradicating the legacy of inequality and
 at the same time enhance our ability to bring justice closer to an
 increasing mass of our people. The existence of Equality Courts
 symbolizes the collective will of the people to succeed despite
 enormous odds.
 14
 In terms of the Equality Act all High Courts are Equality Courts
 for their areas of jurisdiction. In respect of magistratesâ courts the
 Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development is required to
 designate Equality Courts following consultation with the head of
 administrative regions (Chief Magistrates).
 The process of designating Equality Courts took place in two
 phases resulting in 219 designated Equality Courts countrywide.
 The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development is in
 the process of completing the third and last phase of designating
 the remaining magisterial districts as Equality Courts.
 Who can submit a complainant to the Equality Court
 Proceedings in the Equality Court may be instituted by:
 ?? Any person acting in his or her own interest;
 ?? Any person acting on behalf of another person who cannot act
 in his/ her own name;
 ?? Any person acting as a member of ,or in the interest of a
 group or class of persons;
 ?? Anyone acting in the interest of the public;
 ?? Any association or organization or body acting in the interests
 of its memberâs; or
 ?? The South African Human Rights Commission or the Commission
 on Gender Equality.
 Orders of the Equality Court
 Equality Courts are empowered to make, amongst others, the
 following orders in terms of section 21(2) of the Equality Act:
 ?? An order for the payment of damages by the respondent to the
 applicant;
 ?? An order making specific opportunity and privileges unfairly
 denied, available to the complainant;
 ?? An appropriate order of deterrent nature;
 ?? Refer the case to an alternative forum to deal with the matter
 e.g. to the Director of Public Prosecutions for possible institution
 of criminal proceedings.
 IMPACT OF THE EQUALITY ACT TO OUR DEMOCRATIC
 SOCIETY
 One of the challenges impacting negatively on the Equality Act
 has been lack of awareness of this legislation by the South African
 public.
 In order to address this challenge the Department of Justice and
 Constitutional Development is currently educating the public about
 on the importance of promoting equality and overcome unfair
 discrimination, hate speech and harassment. This will ensure that
 the ideal of a democratic society based on the values of human
 dignity, equality and freedom becomes a reality.
 Members of the public are therefore urged to make use of the
 Equality Courts where they suspect that they have been discriminated
 where they have been harassed as explained above. If you suspect
 you have a case for these courts, approach your nearest magistrate
 court and ask for the Equality Court and the equality clerk.
 The equality clerk will then assist you in lodging your complaint.

 The Equality Courts have addressed over 77
 inequality cases reported in different provinces
 in the period between April and December
 2008. âWe have channelled all our efforts into
 ensuring that we finalise pending cases as
 soon as possible,â says Samuel Rasiuba, the
 Deputy Director of Legal Administration
 The Department has developed a programme
 of action to revive and popularise services of
 the Equality Courts. It has established partnerships
 with the National House of Traditional
 Leaders, Advice Centres and Community
 Development Workers on equality matters.
 âWe plan to hold workshops and seminars
 on a continuous basis with National Governmental
 Organisations, Traditional Leaders,
 Community Development Workers and Advice
 Centres in an effort to popularise the work of
 the Equality Courts,â said Mr Rasiuba.
 These seminars will be held for members of
 the South African Police Services (SAPS) as
 well. âThey will assist the SAPS to identify the
 nature of cases, which should be referred to
 the Equality Courts. We have done a lot thus
 the success of the equality courts cannot be
 achieved overnight.â
 A simplified version of promotional materials
 has been developed and made available in
 all public areas. These materials, including
 the Equality Act, have been translated into all
 official languages. Negotiations with the European
 Rights on strengthening partnerships with civil
 society have been concluded. The aim is to
 raise awareness on issues such as constitutional
 rights, public participation and Equality
 Courts.
 Mr Rasiuba added that the establishment of
 Equality Courts must be viewed as one of the
 strategies intended to make access to justice
 easier to ordinary people. It will target mostly
 the vulnerable members of the society such
 as women and people with disabilities. He
 urged members of the public to make use of
 these courts and to report all inequality related
 Addressing challenges and reaching out
 Equality Courts face challenges such as improving
 awareness, access and infrastructure.
 However, they have done well in dealing with
 past imbalances. âIn terms of the regulations,
 equality cases should at least be finalised
 within two months,â said Mr Rasiuba.
 To address lack of awareness, Mr Rasiuba
 said the Department developed material on
 slots on radio stations across the country as
 well as the Justice on The Air Waves programmes.
 These initiatives aim to popularise
 services of the Equality Courts.
 Role of SAHRC, CGE and Legal Aid Board
 The role of the Commission for Gender
 Equality (CGE) is to resolve all gender based
 discriminations. The CGE is required in terms
 of PEPUDA to assist complainants in brining
 cases to the equality courts.
 Success Rate of the Equality Courts
 The CGE has successfully investigated, mediated
 various parts of the country. The commission
 has provincial offices in all nine provinces to
 monitor the operation and functioning of the
 Equality Courts. The South African Human
 Rights Commission (SAHRC) intervenes in
 cases relating to racism, harassment and hate
 speech. These two organisations have contributed
 significantly to stamping out the legacy of
 inequalities and the overall success rate of the
 Equality Courts.
 Legal representation is permissible in Equality
 Courtâs proceedings. Mr Rasiuba added
 provide legal aid free of charge to complainants
 in all equality court cases. He said that all
 these stakeholders including the Department
 of Justice and Constitutional Development
 have a role to play in popularising services of
 Equality Courts and conduct public awareness
 campaigns.

 Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development
 Enver Surty, signed two agreements with Hong
 Kongâs Secretary for Security Ambrose Lee, on the Surrender
 of Fugitive Offenders (SFO) and Mutual Legal
 Assistance (MLA) in criminal matters. The bilateral agreements
 between the Hong Kong Special Administrative
 Region (HKSAR) and South Africa were signed on Friday
 20 February, in the dynamic Asian region.
 Both the SFO and MLA agreements are to come into
 effect 30 days after certain requirements are met. This
 entails South Africa and Hong Kong notifying each other
 in writing that they have complied with their respective requirements
 for the agreementâs entry into force. The SFO
 and MLA Agreements signed are respectively the 18th
 and 26th bilateral agreements of their kind concluded by
 Hong Kong with other nations. The SFO agreement sets
 out the conditions for the surrender of fugitive offenders
 and contains comparable safeguards to those in similar
 international agreements.
 Highlights of the agreements
 On the double criminality rule, the conduct in respect of
 which a personâs surrender is required must constitute an
 offence punishable by imprisonment for at least one year
 according to the law of both parties, the agreements said.
 Surrender may be refused if the offence for which surrender
 of a fugitive is requested is punishable with the death
 penalty. On the political offences rule, surrender shall be
 refused if the offence in question is an offence of a political
 character. On the prima facie rule, a requirement that
 party should be sufficient to justify his committal for trial
 according to the law of the requested party.

 On the specialty rule, a person surrendered must not be
 tried for offences other than those for which he was surrendered,
 said the agreements. The conduct in which a
 personâs surrender is required must constitute an offence
 punishable by imprisonment for at least one year, according
 to both partiesâ law. Surrender may be refused if the
 offence for which surrender of a fugitive is requested is
 punishable with the death penalty.
 The mutual legal assistance in criminal matters agreement
 includes identifying and locating people, document
 serving, and obtaining and delivering statements, evidence,
 articles or documents.

 Hong Kong was returned to the PRC on 1 July 1997, previously
 being a colony of Britain. As a result of this, Hong
 Kong became known as the HKSAR of the Peopleâs
 Republic of China (PRC). In practical terms, the PRC is in
 control of all military and foreign relations (state to state)
 of the PRC. However, all matters pertaining to the
 legal system (including the rule of law), monetary control,
 customs union, freedom of the press, education, trade,
 cultural, technology matters etc. remain the domain of the
 Government of the HKSAR.

 Loxton, but that very few people were making use of these
 requirements needed when going to these Courts. He also
 talked about the various forms of discrimination.
 Grade 9 and 10 pupils in the Free State were selected
 as Justice Ambassadors for their schools, during the

 then at school,â said Senior Legal Administrator Tshuba
 Makua.The campaign which aims to educate high school
 pupils about their Constitutional rights and responsibilities,
 is in preparation of Human Rights Day on 21 March.
 Mr Makua urged the pupils to respect the laws of the
 country. âStand up and say no to crime. We need people
 who will say, I am not going to involve myself in criminal
 activities.â He encouraged the learners to befriend
 themselves with their books as that would secure them a
 bright future. The youngsters were also educated about
 the importance of the Constitution as well as the issues of
 domestic violence, maintenance, estate control, teenage
 pregnancy, drug abuse and the effects of peer pressure.
 âWe have learned a lot. Thank you for choosing our
 school,â said Lebohang Matsoara, a Grade 10 pupil from

 Family Advocates to share expertise
 at annual meetings
 South African Family Advocates
 will now meet annually to share
 experience and expertise on their
 work. This decision came about
 at the inaugural Family Advocate
 Conference, on 22 to 24 January,
 themed âThe Dawn of the Childrenâs
 Actâ. About 190 Family Advocates
 attended the conference.
 The conference aimed to build
 upon the Public Sectorâs service
 delivery pledge, which is in the
 Batho Pele principles. This conference
 will define essential and
 actual questions to debate new
 ideas about what should be done
 to inform future policies in the field
 of Family Law and Practice. Future
 conferences will further give full
 effect to the Constitutional Rights of
 children.
 Chief Family Advocate Petunia
 Seabi said âThis is the first of its
 kind. We hope to do it annually. We
 decided to bring professionals in
 this industry to discuss issues such
 as the Childrenâs Act.â

 apprised to deal with the merits of

 remain in the care of the abducting
 together with the child.

 Chief Family Advocate Petunia Seabi.
 1. Q: What can South African parents do when a former
 spouse has abducted a child and taken them abroad?
 The left behind parent should try as much as possible to establish
 the details of the departure and destination of the abducting
 parent and/or the child. The Hague Convention gives the left
 behind parent the option of approaching the office of the designated
 Central Authority for the RSA, which is the office of the
 Chief Family Advocate or the Central Authority of the country
 where the child has been abducted to. The abducted child must
 be below sixteen years of age.In order to facilitate the processing
 of the application in the OCFA, the left behind parent furnish
 the following documents:
 â¢ Original/certified copies of setting out cutody/guardianship
 rights. Examples of these are marriage certificate, court
 orders granting the alleged rights, unabridged birth certificates,
 etc.
 â¢ Recent photographs of the abductor and the child
 â¢ A sworn statement setting out the facts and circumstances
 around the alleged abduction
 â¢ Copies of pleadings filed in pending litigation in RSA courts,
 where applicable
 The left behind parent will also be required to complete a prescribed
 form which is used by central authorities in most of the
 contracting countries.
 2. Q: What are the steps taken in recovering an abducted
 child, in terms of the Hague Convention and SA Childrenâs
 Act?
 The RSA Central Authority immediately after receipt of the necessary
 documents considers the legal aspects of the request
 as well as the Convention status of the country to which the
 child has been taken. If the child has been taken to a contracting
 country and all legalities have been satisfied, the C.A. will
 compile a bundle and forward the application to the foreign
 C.A, requesting prompt return of the child. The procedure does
 not apply where a child has been taken to a non-Convention
 country.
 All C.A.âs are required by the Convention to take steps to obtain
 a voluntary return of the child. This is done through cross-border
 mediation. Litigation is resorted to in the event that the mediation
 fails. This approach is also consistent with the general principles
 set out in the Childrenâs Act, namely, that in any matter
 concerning a child âan approach which is conducive to conciliation
 and problem-solving should be followedâ.
 It is however, important that the left-behind parent alert the
 Central Authority to the possibility of further movement/possible
 harm to the child, should the abducting parent know of the
 application for return. In such cases the C.A. will take steps to
 obtain an urgent court order to prevent further movement of, or
 possible harm to the child.
 3. Q: How does the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects
 of International Child Abduction relate to custody rulings
 made in South African civil courts?
 Two scenarios arise in this regard. First, an order granting
 custody can be used as proof of parental rights by the parent
 seeking return of their abducted child. Second, is where an
 abductor seeks an order in the RSA court, which will have an
 effect of ratifying the wrongfulness of the removal or retention of
 the child in S.A. In this case the Central Authority will invoke article
 16 of the Convention to stop/suspend the proceedings until
 a decision has been made on the return of the child to his/her
 country of habitual residence. The judicial authorities/courts of a
 contracting state to which a child has been taken or retained are
 required by the Convention not decide on the merits of custody
 be returned.
 4. Q: There are limitations to the treatyâs application, in that
 the Convention applies only between countries that have
 adopted it as âContracting States.â What are the procedures
 for recovering a child from a non Contracting State?
 From a South African perspective, it is advisable that the leftbehind
 parent obtain an order through the normal civil procedures,
 that declare the removal/retention of the child unlawful
 and a breach of their parental rights. Once such an order has
 been obtained, the left behind parent must obtain a mirror order
 or an order for enforcement in the foreign jurisdiction which
 also orders return of the child. This route is very expensive as

 it involves the instruction of lawyers in
 foreign countries. For this reason, the
 Hague Conference on Private International
 Law is taking steps to encourage
 other countries to consider contracting
 under this Convention.
 5. Q: What are the countries which
 subscribe to the Hague Convention?
 Most European, Commonwealth countries
 and the USA. In Africa, the RSA,
 Mauritius and Zimbabwe only. The latter
 has however not designated a central
 authority. We need to take urgent steps
 share national borders as well as other
 African states to enter into mutual child
 protection agreements, given the vast
 numbers of minor children moving across
 our respective borders, some even unaccompanied
 or without any form of adult
 supervision.
 6. Q: If the parent who has taken a
 child overseas feels that the parent in
 South Africa is abusive, a danger to
 the child or cannot provide adequate
 care; how do they go about defending
 their actions, in terms the Hague Convention
 and SA Childrenâs Act?
 The Convention makes provision for the
 abducting parent to oppose the application
 for return. Where the abducting
 parent establishes that there is a grave
 risk that the return sought will expose the
 child to physical, psychological harm, or
 would place the child in intolerable situation,
 then the court hearing the application
 is not bound to order return. It should
 be noted that mere allegations of grave
 risk will not persuade a court to refuse
 the return; it must be shown that the risk
 is a serious or that the envisaged harm is
 of significant proportion.
 7. Q: Are there timeframes that apply
 under the Hague Convention on the
 Civil Aspects of International Child
 Abduction?
 Among the most popular defences that
 have been raised in return applications
 is that the child objects to the return. In
 such instances, an assessment must be
 made, usually through the assistance
 of a Family Counsellor or psychologist,
 maturity to form a viewpoint that the court
 may consider. The childâs reasons for
 the objection will also be examined in
 order to exclude possible influence by the
 abducting parent.
 Some of the defences available are that
 the removal was not wrongful, that the
 left behind parent was not exercising his/
 her parental rights at the time of removal
 or retention, or that the left behind parent
 had agreed or subsequently acquiesced
 to the removal/retention.
 Where available evidence indicates that
 the child has become settled in the new
 environment the court may not necessarily
 order a return.
 In cases where a childâs return would be
 contrary to the RSAâs fundamental principles
 relating to protection of human rights
 and fundamental freedoms, our courts
 are courts are also under no obligation to
 order return.
 A number of them, including:
 1. Children who have attained the age
 of 16 years are not covered by the
 Convention.
 2. If a child has been wrongfully
 removed for less than one year,
 the childâs removal is to be ordered
 forthwith under the Convention. The
 Convention makes it mandatory for
 the judicial authority to order return.
 3. If a child has been wrongfully removed
 exception is allowed -a court may
 choose not to return the child if there
 is evidence that the child is settled in
 his/her new environment. The court
 has a discretion to order/refuse the
 return.
 4. Courts and administrative authorities
 should act quickly in such cases but
 if one has not reached a decision
 within six weeks from the date proceedings
 commenced, an applicant
 or the Central Authority of the requested
 State may officially request
 a reason for the delay.
 5. The Convention only applies to
 wrongful removals/retentions occurring
 after the treaty became effective
 between the involved countries.
 6. Generally, the Convention requires
 that countries act without delay
 in child abduction cases that fall
 within its parameters. It is one of
 the objectives of the Convention
 to protect children internationally
 from the harmful effects of wrongful
 procedures of ensuring prompt
 return of children to their country
 of habitual residence. The aim is to
 ensure that a competent court in the
 on the merits of custody, access and
 even permanent removal to another
 This is based on the premise that
 court in the country of habitual
 residence is better apprised to obtain
 all relevant evidence regarding the
 merits of custody, care and contact
 and in a better position to grant an
 order that will be in the best interests
 of and/or least detrimental to the
 welfare of the child. For this reason,
 the Hague Convention is deemed
 to be consistent with our applicable
 laws and the Constitution, through
 affording the best interests of the
 child paramount importance.

 Improvements to the
 Maintenance System
 Improving the maintenance system
 to relieve the pressure on the
 courts is one of the Department of
 Justice and Constitutional Developmentâs
 key strategic objective. This
 objective goes hand in hand with
 catering for the needs of vulnerable
 groups, improving the standard of
 service delivery and broadening
 access to justice.
 The Maintenance Act, 1998 (Act
 99 of 1998), came into operation
 on 26 November 1999. Clause 27
 of the Convention on Rights of the
 Child signed by South Africa in New
 York in 1989 specifically requires
 State parties to take all appropriate
 measures in order to secure the recovery
 of maintenance for the child
 from the parent or other person
 having financial responsibility for
 the child.
 Operation Isondlo
 Despite the existence of this Act
 and the innovative amendments
 that have been introduced, women
 continue to struggle to access
 maintenance due to inefficiencies
 in the system and lack of adequate
 resources and human capacity.
 To improve the system, the Department
 Isondlo campaign. Operation
 of the campaign was to change the
 negative public perception about
 the maintenance system in the
 country through the following series
 of interventions:
 â¢ Capacity building at
 maintenance sections of
 â¢ Enforcement of the
 Maintenance Act in particular
 civil enforcement;
 â¢ Decrease in the backlog of
 maintenance cases;
 processes;
 â¢ Reduction of poverty;
 â¢ Consultative meetings with
 stakeholders; and
 â¢ Public education and
 awareness campaigns.
 To enhance Operation Isondlo,
 the Department appointed:
 â¢ 577 Maintenance Clerks;
 â¢ 86 Maintenance Officers;
 Investigators;
 â¢ 100 Legal Interns;
 â¢ 13 Acting/ Additional
 Magistrates; and
 â¢ 124 Childrenâs Court Clerks.
 January/February 2009 Justice Today l 27
 Quality services & adherence to
 Maintenance Act
 The appointment of legally trained maintenance
 officers has improved the quality
 of the service rendered and has enhanced
 the implementation of the provisions
 of the Maintenance Act.
 A total of 111,579 maintenance enquires
 were received and about 20,744 warrants
 of arrest were issued for defaulters.
 A total of 74,608 orders were made by
 consent, 6,868 orders were made by
 default and 1,047 foreign orders were
 registered or confirmed. The Department
 received 34,831 complaints in terms of
 section 6 of the Act.
 Proceedings at Maintenance Courts
 Every magistrateâs court is a Maintenance Court for
 Act, and every public prosecutor is deemed
 to be a maintenance officer for his or her court.
 The maintenance officer institutes an inquiry in the
 maintenance court after investigating complaints relating
 to maintenance. The maintenance officer may
 issue subpoenas to have relevant persons appear
 before the magistrate at the maintenance inquiry.
 At the inquiry, evidence is led and parties may
 obtain legal representation. The proceedings are
 closed to the public.
 After a thorough inquiry, the presiding officer of
 the maintenance court may make a wide range of
 orders relating to maintenance: discharge and variation
 of existing maintenance orders, orders by consent
 or default and orders imposing costs for paternity
 tests. Maintenance Courts give civil judgments
 which may be appealed against to the High Court
 and then to the Supreme Court of Appeal. Orders of
 the Maintenance Court are enforceable by execution
 against property, emoluments attachments or
 attachments of debt due to the maintenance debtor.
 Non-compliance with maintenance orders (eg. Nonpayment
 of maintenance) is a criminal offence.
 If a court convicted a person for non-payment of
 maintenance, it may (if it has civil jurisdiction) hold
 a summary inquiry and thereafter grant an order for
 payment of maintenance arrears.
 Criminal proceedings in a magistratesâ court for
 failure to pay maintenance can be converted into a
 maintenance inquiry.

 before you start cooking for people.

 Government officials like police
 officers must stop accepting
 bribery. These are officials who
 work directly with criminals
 and their loyalty is important.
 If South African Police Service
 (SAPS) employees take bribes
 from crime committers they will
 be promoting crime levels.
 Clement Mokgomole
 The citizens of
 South Africa
 can stop crime
 by saying no to
 stolen goods.
 steal goods out
 there they know
 that there is a market for them to sell. Stop
 buying stolen goods will help in reducing
 crime levels.
 Precious Mahlaula
 Many young people are committing crime
 because government
 is not providing
 more jobs. Our
 government must
 have programms
 benefit the youth
 of South Africa.
 Iâm saying this
 because we have many young people who
 drop out of school and decide to do crime.
 Tshego Matlala
 Government must try and build some sports facilities in the communities to keep
 people especially young ones away from crime. Unemployment and illiteracy
 levels also contribute on increasing crime levels. Both our people and government
 must unite to fight unemployment and illiteracy.
 In this issie we asked officials in the Department
 and the public about their views on this topic

 State of the Nation Address by His Excellency JG Zuma, President of the Republic of South Africa, Joint Sitting of Parliament, Cape Town
 3 June 2009
 Honourable Speaker;
 Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
 Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP;
 Deputy President of the Republic, Kgalema Motlanthe
 Former President of the Republic, Thabo Mbeki,
 Our icon, the First President of a democratic South Africa, Isithwalandwe Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela,
 Former Deputy Presidents,
 Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces;
 Esteemed members of the Judiciary;
 Chairperson of SALGA, mayors and leaders in our system of local government;
 Chairperson of the National House of Traditional Leaders and our honoured traditional leaders;
 Heads of Chapter 9 Institutions;
 Governor of the Reserve Bank,
 Religious leaders,
 Directors-General and other leaders of the public service;
 President of the Pan African Parliament, Honourable Idriss Endele Moussa,
 Your Excellencies Ambassadors and High Commissioners;
 Distinguished guests, comrades and friends;
 Fellow South Africans,
 Dumelang, Avuxeni, Molweni,
 On the 22nd of April, millions of South Africans went out to cast their votes.
 They exercised their democratic right spurred on by the desire to change their lives for the better.
 In their overwhelming numbers, they confirmed that working together we can do more to fight poverty and build a better life for all.
 They were encouraged by the vision of an inclusive society, a South Africa that belongs to all, a nation united in its diversity, a people working together for the greater good of all.
 We are humbled by this decisive electoral mandate given by the people of our country, who have chosen their government in a most convincing manner.
 Honourable Members,
 Our nation has over the past few years gone through very challenging times.
 It is thanks to the fact that we have a strong and fully functional constitutional democratic system, with solid institutions, that we overcame these difficulties smoothly and with dignity.
 Today`s occasion is a celebration of what makes this democracy work. It is also a celebration of our culture of continuity and collective responsibility.
 This is evidenced by the presence here of our icon Madiba, who laid the foundation for the country`s achievements, and that of former President Thabo Mbeki, who built on that foundation.
 The continuity is also evident in the fact that former President Kgalema Motlanthe is now the Deputy President of the Republic, after a seamless transition, making us a unique country in many respects.
 Fellow South Africans,
 As you would be aware, the fight against poverty remains the cornerstone of our government`s focus.
 On the 9th of May, during the Presidential inauguration, we made a commitment to our people and the world that:
 For as long as there are South Africans who die from preventable disease;
 For as long as there are workers who struggle to feed their families and who battle to find work;
 For as long as there are communities without clean water, decent shelter or proper sanitation;
 For as long as there are rural dwellers unable to make a decent living from the land on which they live;
 For as long as there are women who are subjected to discrimination, exploitation or abuse;
 For as long as there are children who do not have the means nor the opportunity to receive a decent education;
 We shall not rest, and we dare not falter, in our drive to eradicate poverty.
 In pursuit of these goals, our government has identified 10 priority areas, which form part of our Medium Term Strategic Framework for 2009 to 2014.
 The programme is being introduced under difficult economic conditions.
 The past year has seen the global economy enter a period of crisis unprecedented in recent decades.
 While South Africa has not been affected to the extent that a number of other countries have, its effects are now being clearly seen in our economy. We have entered a recession.
 It is more important now than ever that we work in partnership on a common programme to respond to this crisis.
 We take as our starting point the framework for South Africa's response to the international economic crisis, concluded by government, labour and business in February this year. We must act now to minimise the impact of this downturn on those most vulnerable.
 We have begun to act to reduce job losses. There is an agreement in principle between government and the social partners on the introduction of a training layoff.
 Workers who would ordinarily be facing retrenchment due to economic difficulty would be kept in employment, for a period of time and re-skilled.
 Discussion on the practical detail is continuing between the social partners and the institutions that would be affected by such an initiative, including the Sector Education and Training Authorities.
 We will support the work of the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to assist employers and workers to find alternatives to retrenchments through the relevant legal process.
 To date, CCMA commissioners have saved over four thousand jobs through facilitation processes, and provided ongoing advice and support to retrenched workers.
 The Industrial Development Corporation has developed a programme to fund companies in distress. We will also ensure that government buys more goods and services locally, without undermining our global competitiveness or pushing up costs beyond acceptable levels.
 Building on the successes of our industrial policy interventions, a scaled up Industrial Policy Action Plan will be developed.
 The lead sectors already identified are automobile, chemicals, metal fabrication, tourism, clothing and textiles as well as forestry. In addition, attention will also be paid to services, light manufacturing and construction amongst others, in the quest to create decent jobs.
 As part of Phase 2 of the Expanded Public Works Programme, the Community Work Programme will be fast-tracked.
 It offers a minimum level of regular work to those who need it, while improving the quality of life in communities.
 The economic downturn will affect the pace at which our country is able to address the social and economic challenges it faces. But it will not alter the direction of our development.
 The policy priorities that we have identified, and the plans that we placed before the electorate, remain at the core of the programme of this government.
 In the spirit of a South African community, let us join our hands to find solutions together. The time has come to work harder.
 Our government will look forward, not backward!
 The steps outlined in our Medium Term Strategic Framework had to take into account the constraints posed by the economic crisis. The downturn should not cause us to change these plans. Instead it should urge us to implement these with speed and determination.
 The Framework focuses on 10 priorities.
 We make a commitment that working together we will speed up economic growth and transform the economy to create decent work and sustainable livelihoods.
 We will introduce a massive programme to build economic and social infrastructure.
 We will develop and implement a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land and agrarian reform and food security.
 We will strengthen the skills and human resource base.
 We will improve the health profile of all South Africans.
 Working together with all South Africans, we will intensify the fight against crime and corruption.
 We will build cohesive, caring and sustainable communities.
 Working with Africa and the rest of the world, we will pursue African advancement and enhanced international co-operation.
 We will ensure sustainable resource management and use.
 And, working with the people and supported by our public servants, we will build a developmental state, improve public services and strengthen democratic institutions.
 It is my pleasure and honour to highlight the key elements of our programme of action.
 The creation of decent work will be at the centre of our economic policies and will influence our investment attraction and job-creation initiatives.
 In line with our undertakings, we have to forge ahead to promote a more inclusive economy.Ã
 In this regard, we will utilise state levers such as procurement, licensing and financial support to assist small medium enterprises as well as to promote the implementation of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment and affirmative action policies.
 The implementation will be done in recognition of the need to correct the imbalances of the past.
 The transformation will be undertaken in support of women, youth and people with disabilities.
 We will reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses. The matter of being stifled by regulations has been raised by the sector several times.
 In another intervention to create an enabling environment for investment, government will move towards a single integrated business registration system.
 This will improve customer service and reduce the cost of doing business in South Africa.
 Another important element of our drive to create job opportunities is the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP). The initial target of one million jobs has been achieved.
 The second phase of the programme aims to create about four million job opportunities by 2014.
 Between now and December 2009, we plan to create about 500 000 job opportunities.
 While creating an environment for jobs and business opportunities, government recognises that some citizens will continue to require state social assistance. Social grants remain the most effective form of poverty alleviation. As of 31 March 2009, more than 13 million people received social grants, more than 8 million of whom are children.
 We are mindful of the need to link the social grants to jobs or economic activity in order to encourage self-reliance amongst the able-bodied.
 Most importantly during this period, neighbours should assist each other.
 Now is the time for unity. Let us help each other like neighbours.
 Let us agree that there should be no child who will go to bed with a hungry stomach just because his/her parents are unemployed. If we can unite and work together, we can do more.]
 Distinguished guests, as part of the second strategic priority we will continue with our programme to build economic and social infrastructure.
 The newly-formed Infrastructure Development Cluster of government will ensure that the planned R787 billion infrastructure expenditure as provided for in the budget earlier this year is properly planned for and executed.
 This funding includes allocations for the school building programme, public transport including the bus rapid transit system, housing, water and sanitation.
 One of the biggest infrastructure investment projects is in the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup. We have, as government and the nation at large, pledged that the World Cup will leave a proud legacy from which Our children and our communities will benefit for many years to come.
 We are on track to meet all our obligations and are determined to give the world the best World Cup ever.
 We are putting all systems in place to make the Confederations Cup, which kicks off on the 14th of June, a huge success.
 In April this year, I gave an undertaking to the taxi industry leadership to defer negotiations relating to the operation of the Bus Integrated Rapid Transit system until after the elections.
 We undertook to allow more time to deal properly with the concerns of the industry.Ã On the 11th of June the Minister of Transport will resume discussions with the industry.
 The meeting will kick-start a series of engagements with the stakeholders affected by the BRT system. We are confident that unresolved issues will be dealt with to the satisfaction of all parties.
 This will include the important issue of how all stakeholders will benefit from the initiative.
 Honourable Members,
 Another development which should boost the World Cup is the roll-out of the digital broadcasting infrastructure and signal distribution transmitters.
 Overall, we will ensure that the cost of telecommunications is reduced through the projects under way to expand broadband capacity.
 We have to ensure that we do not leave rural areas behind in these exciting developments.
 As part of social infrastructure development we will provide suitably located and affordable housing and decent human settlements.
 We will proceed from the understanding that human settlement is not just about building houses.
 It is about transforming our cities and towns and building cohesive, sustainable and caring communities with closer access to work and social amenities, including sports and recreation facilities.
 In this spirit, we will work with Parliament to speed up the processing of the Land Use Management Bill.
 Working together with our people in the rural areas, we will ensure a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land and agrarian reform and food security, as our third priority.
 I would like to use this opportunity to extend our condolences to the family of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Dirk du Toit, who passed away this week. His contribution will be sorely missed.
 People in the rural areas also have a right to electricity and water, flush toilets, roads, entertainment and sport centres; as well as better shopping centres like those in the cities.
 They too have a right to be helped in farming so that they can grow vegetables and other things; and raise livestock so that they can feed themselves.
 We are prepared to start this campaign of building infrastructures in rural areas. Working together with communities, chiefs, councillors and headmen we will be able to speed up this work.
 We urge people in the rural areas to start preparing to tell us about the things that they need urgently. Working together we can do more.]Ã Ã
 Hon. Speaker and Chairperson,
 While having drawn the necessary lessons from earlier rural development initiatives, we have chosen the Greater Giyani Local Municipality in Limpopo as the first of the pilot projects for the campaign. Out of these projects will emerge lessons for the whole country.
 In addition, we will work on the targeted renewal of rural towns, through grants such as the Neighbourhood Development Grant programme. In this way, areas around the towns will benefit from the economic boost.
 With all these interventions, we are poised to change the face of rural areas in our country.
 Compatriots,
 Education will be a key priority for the next five years. We want our teachers, learners and parents to work with government to turn our schools into thriving centres of excellence.
 The Early Childhood Development programme will be stepped up, with the aim of ensuring universal access to Grade R and doubling the number of 0-4 year old children by 2014.
 We reiterate our non-negotiables. Teachers should be in school, in class, on time, teaching, with no neglect of duty and no abuse of pupils! The children should be in class, on time, learning, be respectful of their teachers and each other, and do their homework.
 To improve school management, formal training will be a pre-condition for promoting teachers to become principals or heads of department.
 I will meet school principals to share our vision on the revival of our education system.
 Fellow South Africans,
 We will increase our efforts to encourage all pupils to complete their secondary education.
 The target is to increase enrolment rates in secondary schools to 95 per cent by 2014.Ã We are also looking at innovative measures to bring back into the system pupils who dropped out of school, and to provide support.
 Honourable Members, we are very concerned about reports of teachers who sexually harass and abuse children, particularly girls.
 We will ensure that the Guidelines on Sexual Harassment and Violence in Public Schools are widely disseminated, and that learners and teachers are familiar with and observe them.
 We will take very serious, and very decisive, action against any teachers who abuse their authority and power by entering into sexual relationships with children.
 To promote lifelong learning, the Adult Basic Education and Training Kha ri Gude programme will be intensified.
 Compatriots, Honourable Members,
 We have to ensure that training and skills development initiatives in the country respond to the requirements of the economy.
 The Further Education and Training sector with its 50 colleges and 160 campuses nationally will be the primary site for skills development training.
 We will improve the access to higher education of children from poor families and ensure a sustainable funding structure for universities.
 Fellow South Africans,
 We are seriously concerned about the deterioration of the quality of health care, aggravated by the steady increase in the burden of disease in the past decade and a half.
 We have set ourselves the goals of further reducing inequalities in health care provision, to boost human resource capacity, revitalise hospitals and clinics and step up the fight against the scourge of HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and other diseases.
 We must work together to improve the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan for the Treatment, Management and Care of HIV and AIDS so as to reduce the rate of new HIV infections by 50% by the year 2011.Ã We want to reach 80% of those in need of ARV treatment also by 2011.
 We will introduce a National Health Insurance scheme in a phased and incremental manner. In order to initiate the NHI, the urgent rehabilitation of public hospitals will be undertaken through Public-Private Partnerships.
 We are also paying urgent attention to the issues of remuneration of health professionals to remove uncertainty in our health services.
 Working together let us do more to promote quality health care, in line with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to halve poverty by 2014.
 Fellow citizens,
 Together we must do more to fight crime. Our aim is to establish a transformed, integrated, modernised, properly-resourced and well-managed criminal justice system.
 It is also critically important to improve the efficiency of the courts and the performance of prosecutors and to enhance detective, forensic and intelligence services. This work has started in earnest, and it will be undertaken with new energy and vigour.
 Among the immediate targets is to ensure that we increase the number of prosecutors and Legal Aid Board personnel. We will do the same with police detectives.
 We changed the name of the relevant Ministry from Safety and Security to Police to emphasise that we want real operational energy in police work. This will contribute to the reduction of serious and violent crimes by the set target of 7% to 10% per annum.
 The most serious attention will also be given to combating organised crime, as well as crimes against women and children.
 Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
 While appreciating the investment of the private sector in the security industry, we will improve the regulation of this industry.
 Amongst other key initiatives, we will start the process of setting up a Border Management Agency; we shall intensify our efforts against cyber crime and identity theft, and improve systems in our jails to reduce repeat offending.
 Compatriots,
 I wish to underline our support for the continued transformation of the judiciary.
 The transformation should address key issues such as the enhancement of judicial independence, entrenching internal systems of judicial accountability as well as ensuring full access to justice by all.
 The success of the democratic system as a whole depends on good relations of mutual respect and a spirit of partnership among the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. This is very important for our constitutional democracy.
 Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
 We have repeatedly stated our commitment to fight corruption in the public service.
 We will pay particular attention to combating corruption and fraud in procurement and tender processes, application for drivers` licences, social grants, identity documents (IDs), and theft of police case dockets.
 Let me emphasise that we all have a role to play in this war against crime.Ã
 We must actively participate in Community Policing Forums. We must stop buying stolen goods, which encourages crime.
 We must report crime and assist the police with information to catch wrongdoers. In this way, we will move forward towards a crime-free society.
 Honourable Members, since 1994 we have sought to create a united cohesive society out of our fragmented past. We are called upon to continue this mission of promoting unity in diversity and to develop a shared value system, based on the spirit of community solidarity and a caring society.
 Our shared value system should encourage us to become active citizens in the renewal of our country. We must build a common national identity and patriotism.
 We must develop a common attachment to our country, our Constitution and the national symbols. In this spirit, we will promote the National Anthem and our country`s flag and all other national symbols.
 Our children, from an early age, must be taught to pay allegiance to the Constitution and the national symbols, and know what it means to be South African citizens.
 We will ensure a common national approach to the changing of geographic and place names. This must provide an opportunity to involve all South Africans in forging an inclusive national identity, to deepen our understanding of our history and heritage.
 Sport is a powerful nation-building tool. Working together we must support all our national teams from Bafana Bafana to the Proteas and the Springboks; from Banyana Banyana to Paralympians.
 Our teams can only do well with our support.
 Allow me to use this opportunity to congratulate our national teams for their performances in the past week, indeed in pulling off a hat trick.
 The country`s women`s netball team has done us proud by winning the Tri-Nations Netball Challenge. Congratulations to the Sevens Springboks who have become the IRB Sevens World Series Champions - and not forgetting the Blue Bulls who have won the Super 14 finals in a convincing fashion!
 We take this opportunity to wish the Springboks well in the upcoming series against the British and Irish Lions.
 It is clear that we need to invest on a large scale in sports development. We will speed up the revival of school sport and ensure that it forms part of the school curriculum. In addition we will ensure that the provision of sport facilities in poorer communities receives priority.
 Hon. Speaker and Chairperson,
 We have committed ourselves over the years to contribute to building a better Africa and a better world.
 The main goal of government for the medium term is to ensure that our foreign relations contribute to the creation of an environment conducive to sustainable economic growth and development.
 To this effect, we will continue to prioritise the African continent by strengthening the African Union and its structures, and give special focus to the implementation of the New Partnership for Africa`s Development.
 Equally important, and closer to home, is the strengthening of regional integration with particular emphasis on improving the political and economic integration of SADC, towards the AU goal of a Union government. We will establish a South African Development Partnership Agency to promote developmental partnerships with other countries on the continent.
 South Africa will continue to assist in the reconstruction and development of the African continent especially in post-conflict situations. We will continue to encourage a peaceful and sustainable settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the two- state solution.
 We will support the peace efforts of the African Union and the United Nations on the African continent, including in the Saharawi Arab Republic and Darfur in Sudan.Ã
 As the Chairperson of SADC and Facilitator, we will participate in promoting inclusive government until free and fair elections are held in Zimbabwe.
 The plight of the Zimbabwean people has had a negative impact on the SADC region, especially South Africa. We call upon all peace-loving countries in the world to support the inclusive government to achieve economic recovery.
 We will support efforts of the SADC region to resolve the situation in Madagascar.
 Allow me, distinguished guests, to pay tribute to the SA National Defence Force for their sterling role in peace building in the continent.
 Through continental and regional bodies, we will work towards the entrenchment of democracy and the respect for human rights on the African continent.
 We will contribute to the strengthening of South-South relations and pursue mutually beneficial agreements with key countries of the South.
 We will continue to enhance relations with the developed North including the G8, and our strategic partnership with the European Union.
 We will continue to play an active role in ensuring the conclusion of the WTO Doha Development round of negotiations.
 Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
 South Africa, being a dry country requires urgent action to mitigate adverse environmental changes and to ensure the provision of water to citizens.
 Amongst various programmes, we will implement the Water for Growth and Development strategy, which will strengthen water management.Ã We will continue to improve our energy efficiency and reliance on renewable energy.
 Honourable Members,
 A developmental state requires the improvement of public services and strengthening of democratic institutions.
 We have established two Ministries in the Presidency to strengthen both strategic planning as well as performance monitoring and evaluation.
 To ensure delivery on our commitments, we will hold Cabinet Ministers accountable through performance instruments, using established targets and output measures, starting in July.
 We will also involve State-Owned Enterprises and Development Finance Institutions in the government planning processes and improve the monitoring and evaluation of their performance.
 Honourable Members, fellow South Africans,
 To ensure that all three spheres - local, provincial and national - improve service delivery, we will speed up the establishment of a single Public Service.
 This administration will insist on putting people first in service delivery. We will ensure courteous and efficient service from front-counter staff in the provision of services in all government departments.
 In this era of renewal, we will move towards a more interactive government.
 To lead by example, work has begun on the establishment of a public liaison capacity in the Presidency.
 In addition to receiving letters and emails from the public, we will also establish a hotline for easier access.
 Staff will handle each public inquiry as if it was the only one, following it through all the channels until it receives the attention it deserves.
 Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
 The National Youth Development Agency, formed through the merger of Umsobomvu Youth Fund and the National Youth Commission will be launched on June 16 in Ekurhuleni.

 People all over the world still continue to clamour for his presence and for him to address their crises.
 His values and his example of dedication to the service of humanity is a shining example in today`s troubled world.
 An international campaign has been initiated by the Nelson Mandela Foundation and related organisations, called Mandela Day, which sums up what Tata stands for.
 Mandela Day will be celebrated on the 18th of July each year. It will give people in South Africa and all over the world the opportunity to do something good to help others.
 Madiba was politically active for 67 years, and on Mandela Day people all over the world, in the workplace, at home and in schools, will be called upon to spend at least 67 minutes of their time doing something useful within their communities, especially among the less fortunate.Ã
 Let us wholeheartedly support Mandela Day and encourage the world to join us in this wonderful campaign.
 Honourable Speaker and Chairperson, fellow South Africans,
 We have presented to the nation our programme for the next five years. Attached to each commitment we make is a detailed project plan, with targets and critical milestones.
 This information will in due course be made public. Indeed as citizens we should at the same time ask ourselves what is it that we can do on our own to help promote this national programme.
 To be a citizen is not only about rights, it is also about responsibility, to make a contribution to make ours a better country.
 We also expect to work well with Opposition parties in Parliament, in the spirit of putting the country first.
 In addition, Madiba taught us well that this country belongs to all, black and white. Working for reconciliation and unity will remain important as we move forward.
 Since the implementation of our programme will take place in the face of the economic downturn, we will have to act prudently - no wastage, no rollovers of funds - every cent must be spent wisely and fruitfully. We must cut our cloth according to our size.
 Fellow South Africans, working together we can do more to realise our common vision of a better and more prosperous nation!
 This is the partnership we are calling for.
